The gold may be tempting but youll need the sinew to finish the quest eventually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8512</b></h3>People will often tell you that the Harpy Hide quiver is better than this because it's easier to get. The thing they discount is the 2 extra slots. Those 2 slots in a long raid can make the difference between owning faces or looking like a n00b, and in grinding it makes it so much nicer to not have to make those extra arrow runs. Also, if you look at the BC items, the new quivers (rep items) are the same as this, so once you have this, you've got the best you can get.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>11604</b></h3>If you have this quiver at BC release, KEEP IT. After reviewing the new quivers available in the expansion, they are IDENTICAL -- 18 slot, 15% increase.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the reason they made it THE quiver lol is that the EPIC hunter range weapon is a bow soooo in that case they would make it a quiver</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I couyld not believe it, i never farmed for this thing. My main's guild has MC, ONY, BWL on farm so ill get the leaf and sinew whenever. It dropped while i was doing Test of skulls. i was the only hunter and the group all passed on it and grats me on my epic quiver i didnt even have to say anything other than &quot;OMG! YES!&quot; which IMO is the way it should be handled. I guess for once i should thank Blizz for screwing Horde with test of skulls...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well if you were doing mc and got the leaf chances are your guild can do azurgos to get it and not spend any money</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the guy above me hes is right. If u have harpy hide quiver (Av reward) it pretty much defeats the purpose of geting this quiver. unless u want to have a awesome looking quiver then ya get this but the 2 slot is worthless and dont farm this sinew to make a profit big mistake.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>look at it this way, if your going to sell the sinew someone still has to buy it. This means that there will eventualy be no demand for the sinew and your scrweing yourself out of the best quiver(I am speaking to hunters, all others either make a hunter, or sell it). I know that the populations of servers are not constant and change daily but, and correct me if I'm wrong, there can only be some many accounts with characters on the servers before it gets full, and with that many people playing the game you'd think that most of them are not hunters which is the only class that can use the quiver</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My guess is that it would just &quot;Increase ranged attack speed by 15%&quot;&nbsp; As far as the name meaning there shouldn't be a similar ammo pouch...1) it would be named something else, 2) in WoW there are stranger &quot;ancient&quot; items, 3) this is a game</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Firsh</b></h3>It's weird that quivers and ammo pouches don't go above the normal bag slot numbers. Soul bags, herb pouches anyone?<br /><br />Anyway, I think investing in a 18 bottomless bag or similar is better, as the extra 2 slots are more universal. I never ran out of arrows since lvl 10. I stuff a quiver in my bank with AV arrows, and mail myself a crapload of thorium headed, so they are always available I just need a bank/mailbox. If you need more than 3200, it's not the end of the world to temporarily use your normal bags.</div>
