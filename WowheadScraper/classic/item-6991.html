<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>28169</b></h3>Remember that the drop % is inaccurate. My guess is the real drop rate is around 30-40%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did this as lv35 solo and had problems with the elementals. They resisted most of my magic (they're lv 38/39) so I think this will be impossible do get the robe before reaching my level (without help).<br />Had to sacrifice my Void in almost every fight just to survive but managed to get the 2 pieces of coal after 17 kills.<br />I think the drop-ratio is rather bad or perhaps I was unlucky. Concentrated on the lv38-elementals since the 39's vere to tough. Maybe the 39's have better drop-ratio?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried killing these at 35 using VW but I had problems with the damage shield on the mobs. Had much better luck using succubus and fear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I took me 12 Exiles before I got my coals. Died more times than I care to admit. Robes are sweet though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this at level 34 with the help of my voidwalker. Attract a level 38 elemental with corruption and curse of agony and let big blue steal the aggro.<br /><br />Use health funnel to keep the voidwalker alive and re-cast both dots.<br /><br />If big blue is about to die, sacrifice and get a succubus as a replacement.<br /><br />Be sure to have a healthstone and healing potions for when things get out of hand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was rough, died once in I think 9 pulls. Use your DoTs and your VW. Try to get VW to tank for as long as possible, then hit it with siphon life (if affliction) and fear it. Once you get a fear on him, bolt him and try and bandage yourself. Fear again or drain tank it. Make sure you have healing potions and a healthstone. Definatlely doable at 34 (I did it).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>25,30</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went in at lvl 33, and a alliance lvl 60 was grinding. Once I pointed to my VW, he helped me kill two, both of whom dropped the coal. 2 min, no more, and increased respect between factions. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got really lucky i did it at a lvl 34 with my VW and i got my two coals in the first two guys i killed, but they were both 39s and extremely resitants to everything i had pretty much except curse of agony, corruption and fear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ehm... idont understand why u guys dont use banish? it gives u 10sec rest, to bandage, get ready and banish again, use ur timer to watch him come out EASY!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Today I had to kill about 7 of these guys to get the 2 coals whilst on the quest. I recommend Dawnsingers strat for dealing with them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't really get the problem... I solo'd it today at lvl 34. As Dawnsinger says, pull one with curse of agony and let Viodwalker get aggro. Wait for 2 or 3 taunts, then finish the elemental of with shadowbolts. Only killed the 38's, 39's proved to much of a challenge for me as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I solo'd this at 35 with Felhunter, killed about a dozen to get both pieces, neither myself or pet died at all</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i dont know... as soon as i got to kill the burning exiles it only took me 2 before i got the coals..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With the succubus that is.&nbsp; Tried with voidwalker at first, and just couldn't do it.&nbsp; Died repeatedly.&nbsp; With succubus it went nice....quick and easy for me at lvl 35.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>35 warlock.. VW aggro with DoT's in place, then health funnel your VW as your DoT's do most the work.. of course you have to DoT more than once, but you already knew that..<br />i went 2/2 on those.. killed 2.. got 2 stones.. pretty easy..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just found a lvl 40 rogue over there farming,&nbsp; i asked him if we can party and if he lets me loot first and ill only loot the quest item, he said sure, and i got both of them in 2 kills, just get a guildy or a friend to help you</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a level 35 16/0/11 lock, and found this to be the best strategy against these guys:<br /><br />- Get as far away as possible but still close enough to cast your Dots<br />- Send in Voidwalker, and after he threats, cast Curse of Agony followed by Corruption<br />- If Corruption fails, try it again<br />- Cast Shadowbolts until he starts coming for you (I could usually get in 3/4)<br />- Cast Fear so that it takes effect before he can hit you<br />- Drain Life until he dies<br /><br />This left me at 40% mana, full health, and my VW at 50% health almost-full mana.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is soloable at level 32 by kiting, at least for me as an Affliction spec with instant-cast Corruption, Siphon Life, and Curse of Exhastion.&nbsp; The idea is to use as many damage DoTs as you can, and also put Curse of Exhastion on it to keep it from catching up with you.&nbsp; From the Thoradin's Wall side of the circle, pull a level 38 elemental from far away using any of your DoTs or Curse of Exhastion, then run to the road while applying the rest of your spells.&nbsp; Keep running along the road towards Stromgarde, recasting spells on the elemental as necessary.&nbsp; I had a Felhunter out to help do damage, since the only damage my minion was going to take was the fire from being close to the elemental, and the Felhunter has nice resistances to help with that.&nbsp; Also, you can turn around every once in a while if the elemental is far enough back and try to get a Drain Life off.&nbsp; If this goes badly and the elemental attacks you, it'll probably daze you and you might get stuck in a continual daze while you run away.&nbsp; If that happens, try to get a fear off so that you can put more distance between the two of you, but it might take a lot of tries before you cast one that doesn't get resisted.<br /><br />Six elementals dead and no Smoldering Coal, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm lvl 33, and after reading the posts about cresting charms, I thought I'd give it a try.&nbsp; I bought 5 in the AH (85s), and went up to Arathi.&nbsp; I went for the lvl 39s (higher drop rate?), and made sure I hit them at least once by watching the combat log. (Best bet was melee--spells are resisted too easily. I probably managed to hit it once every four or five tries.)&nbsp; Once I knew I'd hit it, I used a charm--worked every time. Five elementals, five charms, and I had my two smoldering coals!&nbsp; Wow, that was amazing.&nbsp; Seems you'd have to be crazy to do this the hard way...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Large area east of gate - save yourself the next search ))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've now killed 26 of these mobs lookin for the coals. one droped on the first kill, and none sense. I just dropped in to check drop percentage... apperently im just unlucky :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I had to kill about 8 of them to get the two coals. I also got two elemental fire drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I had to kill around 17 Burning Exile's to get the coal to drop, the second one dropped straight after the next one thankfully!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you are killing these as a mid 30s Warlock (for the robes quest), be aware that they have high resists, and you'll probably have to tap your curses/spells several times for them to &quot;stick&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ilthalaine</b></h3>Level 60 Horde camping the elementals has made this pretty much impossible. Tried different times of the day, same thing. Can't even comment on the drop rate, because either all the elementals are dead, or I am. On the plus side, my KoS list just keeps getting longer and longer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pepito84</b></h3>They really need to increase the zone of these. I guess it's fine when people are nice and help you, but today there was these 2 lvl 60 jerks (Alliance, Pranca and Cheiios, server Myzrael) bot farming them, making it impossible for me to complete my warlock quest..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AliasDan</b></h3>Just did this quest as a lvl 31 warlock, eager to get the robes ASAP.
