If it is a newer Hunter in a guild that regularly clears MC, I don't see why a Hunter would take this, but before then, it will be a waste to go to any other class before Hunters.\n\nEdited, Tue May 23 16:18:30 2006","date":"2006-05-23T21:22:46-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"RonoshBeast","importedSubject":"Why it is good for Hunters"},{"commentv2":1,"number":48,"id":3059628,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Really nice bow, looks alot like the ancient bone bow from Scholomance.

Maybe get rid of wing clip and turn it into wing shot. Destroy the dead zone.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7069</b></h3>It is a very common discussion in my guild as to who gets priority on this item.<br /><br />If a guild is capable of clearing to Majordomo, it is my opinion that Rogues/Warriors should have priority on this item over Hunters - since the Hunter Epic quest bow is vastly superior to this item. Most Rogues/Warriors are unlikely to upgrade this item for a long time.<br /><br />If a guild has not cleared up to Majordomo, then Hunters should get priority.<br /><br />It's a very nice bow to boost the AP of any Rogue or Warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This message is not the usual spam.&nbsp; If you are in a raiding guild capable of doing well in MC, think very carefully before spending your DKP on this item.&nbsp; One other hunter and myself are always the top damage dealers on MC runs, within 0.5% of each other.&nbsp; Both of us have the Carapace Spine Crossbow.&nbsp; Both of us are MM spec'd.&nbsp; I had more DKP, bid on this bow and won.&nbsp; I had a scope with me, so I scoped it and used it for the rest of the raid.&nbsp; I pulled ahead in damage maybe another 1.5-2%.&nbsp; Again, this is based on entire raid damage percentages, but I'm guessing that this bow does about 5% more damage, even with the higher DPS.<br /><br />Consider that the xbow has a much slower speed, meaning higher aimed shot and multi-shot crits.&nbsp; Over time, this really adds up.<br /><br />Striker's Mark Pro's:<br />Slightly higher dps over time<br />%to hit is helpful<br />Will draw less aggro<br /><br />Carapace Spine XBow Pro's:<br />Nearly the same damage as SM<br />Uses less ammo<br />PvP and Raid crits very nice<br /><br />I'm not exactly regretting my desicion to get this, but in retrospect, my DKP might have been better utilized on an armor upgrade that you will notice, than a bow that is barely better than an easily obtained crossbow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>From patch 1.10 this is the best bow a hunter can get at this level (MC / Tier 1) unless they do PvP imo....<br />The way that Aimed/Multiple shots are changed have an impact on how weapons will perform .. pity it is not marked Class: Hunter<br /><br />Of course the is the one you get from quest which is the only bow actually marked with 'Class: Hunter'. It is quest that requires a good bow / gun :P as hunter is supposed to solo it (which can be a problem to ensure in itself)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I understand what everyone is saying about how it would be waste for a Hunter to get this bow because they're probably going to start their epic quest soon but are you crazy?&nbsp; Most guild runs will have over 5 Hunters per run, that means at least 5 runs just for those hunters to get the leaf(not including other hunters in guild) That can take a long ass time, so for me being a lower ranked hunter in the guild it will take me a long time for me to get the rights to get leaf. I have the Ancient Bone which does about 31 dps, this does about 39 dps.&nbsp; Now I've talked to alot of hunters about the epic bow quest and I know it's freaking hard.&nbsp; I don't honestly know if I'd be able to do it with the bow I currently have but I know if I had this bow with an extra 8dps my chances would be allooooot better so everyone stop jumping on a hunter for wanting this, its a bad ass bow and thats all we use!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok i have a question. I am a dwarf hunter, and dwarves get +5 to guns skill. How would 5 skill points translate into %chance to hit? Stiker's Mark gives 1% chance to hit but if i got the Blastershot Launcher my weapon skill would be an effective level higher... does anybody know the math on how this works out?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think it is funny how everyone that posts assumes that every other poster's guild is in the same situation as their guild and flames accordingly. <br /><br />From the start to having MC on farm status for a new guild on a new server could be a months-long process and where in that timeframe this bow drops determines where it would be best utilized.&nbsp; <br /><br />If your guild kills Mags for the first time ever and this drops, obviously it would be best served by giving this to your hunters.&nbsp; All the posts saying you'll have Rhok soon aren't taking into account the fact that it might be months before some guilds get to that point after the first of these drops.&nbsp; All of the good MC ranged weapons should go to hunters until you are able to actually kill Domo and start getting Rhok's for the hunters and then they should go to the melee classes.&nbsp; It would be stupid to give this to a rogue if it would be the best weapon any hunter in your guild would have and then struggle to proceed through MC with gimped ranged dps. <br /><br />So for all of the one-sided arguments about who should get what, just take a second and find out what the situation of the person's guild is before flaming largely irrelevant information that is only applicable to one particular situation.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, explain to me why this is a hunter only weapon ? it has no agi no sta no %chance to crit so it has no hunter specific stats on it, now u explain to me why i would be banned blacklisted for rolling on this yet hunters feel the need to roll on items such as treants bane and typhoon u can go and f*ck urself i bet ur a hunter a warrior would benefit from this easily as much as a hunter would we all no hunters are the single worst class at melee in the game, it really annoys me to see hunters be pretend warriors, but in fact u go toe to toe with a pally, rogue or warrior u will get absolutly annihilated, so dont give me that rubbish &quot;banned and blacklisted&quot; when hunters realize that the only time they should roll on such weapons as treants bane and typhoon is when no warrior pally want the weapon then feel free to roll on it until that happens plz stay away from the weapon u would waste on ur hunter, oh and just before u say anything i had a lvl 58 hunter also so i know well and good how to play a hunter and only time i ever used melee was to wing clip and maybe raptor strike other then that any weapon i had was for the stats purpose only, but i would never dream of rolling against a pally or a warrior for such weapons, that is pure greed with no respect for other classes bar ur own, i thank u for ur custom<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 21 11:16:03 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Silly warriors... rayOhar when you talk about depreviving a hunter about stats and if a hunter were to roll on typhoon its the same as a warrior rolling on this item, it pains me. <br /><br />Like you said yourself... hunters = agil and what stats does Typhoon have? OH YEAH agility! I think you need to rethink your statements about how hunters &quot;deprive&quot; warriors and pallys of nice 2h melee weapons when in fact thats not really the case. I dont know why hunters have such a bad name for this kinda thing but honestly... a warrior with typhoon is pretty lame anyways... Arcanite Reaper &gt; Typhoon by far. <br /><br />And as far as you thinking its ok to roll on strikers if hunters can roll on items similar to Typhoon(great stats perfect for a hunter)... well you can just go to hell ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Really, people who say they would <i>roll</i> on this dont have a clue what they are talking about. You dont roll on stuff in MC, you buy them with points in one form or another earned from contributing to the raideffort... I just dont see a warrior/pala/anything bidding on this with a hunter present. If you aren't in raids/guilds using this system you probably wont make it as far as Magmadar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>See the thing is you didnt read my second post i said that i wouldnt roll on this, altho the attack power and +% chance to hit are nice for warriors, but why would i roll, i just fail to see why when hunters are in the same grps as warriors try outroll them for a weapon that the warrior will use a GREAT deal more, im not saying hunters cant use them im just saying u ARE depriving a class of a weapon he WILL greatly benefit from whereas if a hunter rolls and win he WONT benefit from it as much as a warrior by a country mile, now as i said its fair enough if a hunter wants to roll but just before u roll think about who kept u and all those around u alive for the whole instance rather then greeding on a purple item, use the barbarous blade if ur a hunter tbh, really good weapon that has chance to crit on it, why not go for this item ? i know the sta can be useful and everything but thats all i'll say, theres no getting thru to some ppl, all im saying is that hunters can feel free to roll on amazing 2h weapons at first sight then thats wrong, if u had any respect for any other classes like paladin and warrior u would grit ur teeth and pass until it comes to the time where u can roll freely on these items but if u dont and u do roll on these items then fair play but i personally would never grp with some one like that again and advise friends to also stay away from ppl like that</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>even though its DPS doesnt hold up anymore, seeing as its an early MC drop, hunters dont really chase after this bow anymore.<br /><br />Its stats, however, are exceptionally good for melee classes, and many dps warriors and rogues will continue to use this bow well into much harder raid content. Such nice offensive stats are not found on many ranged weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just wanted to point out, slower is not &gt; faster for hunters. It may be for warriors or rogues, but for hunters it's he faster the better. Fast guns get more dps out of scopes and interrupt casters more, for hunters there's no advantage to having a slower gun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Let's please use some logic before posting about Hunters not wanting or needing this bow just because they have the Rhok quest...<br /><br />Magmadar, second boss in Molten Core drops this weapon. Majordomo, who is the 2nd last boss in MC , has a <b>chance</b> to drop the leaf in his chest to start the Rhok quest.<br /><br />Now, most new guilds into MC cannot go from Mags to Domo in one clearing, takes alot of trial and error. This bow will be an upgrade to anything a Hunter in a new guild to MC will have. Hunters use range for primary attacks, common fact. Taking this bow would increase their damage output, helping the guild as a whole progress further more efficient and faster.<br /><br />I am not saying this bow is Hunter only, there is no &quot;class&quot; attached to it. Just common logic. If it is a newer Hunter in a guild that regularly clears MC, I don't see why a Hunter would take this, but before then, it will be a waste to go to any other class before Hunters.<br /><br />Edited, Tue May 23 16:18:30 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes warriors would get as much use out of this bow as hunters would of out of the Typhoon.....Oh wait no thats a bs statement isnt it. <br /><br />Hmm...I guess you dont know much bout being a hunter so ill go easy on you and just lay a basic rough little stat chart on u.<br /><br />Warriors= Melee=95% Range=5%<br /><br />Hunters= Melee=30% Range=70%<br /><br />You see we dont just use melee 'once' per battle like you warriors do. When our pet loses aggro and feign/Disengage/wing clip (a melee attack btw) fail to keep them away (which against lvl 58+ elites will happen freq) you have to melee. I would love to be able to just shoot and never have to do it. Unfortunatly its just not that way buddy. <br /><br />Since ALL you use a ranged wep for is to pull and seperate a group you dont need a wep like this at all. Heck you could accomplish what u use a ranged wep for with just a lvl 1 Gun just for that reason if you ignored the stats on it.<br /><br />So you saying &quot;A Warrior rolling on that is comparable to a hunter rolling on a Typhoon&quot; sounds like a whingy kid who knows NOTHING bout the game. <br /><br />But hey i reckon u should complain to blizz so they give us way more awesome kiting abilities so we dont have to melee. Maybe get rid of wing clip and turn it into wing shot. Destroy the dead zone. Giving conc shot with a lesser cool down and being able to move while shooting...not that we need it to beat warriors down like yourself. Hey i know...why not send us out there with no armor and just a ranged wep and some ammo....retard...<br /><br />P.S. I also like your &quot;hunters are the worst melee class in the game&quot;. What bout Priests/Warlocks/Mages? Didnt know they dealt out crazy melee damage.....<br /><br />P.P.S. Since i know what humans are like i expect @#$%head players like urself to roll on this. Heck if u win it ill be happy for u. Just letting u know that i would roll on a Typhoon. Basic thing is....listen closely......Blizz gave us ablitly to wield 2 handers....When i did strat for the first time and a warrior got to roll on Wileys Gun i accepted this...now its time u do to =D<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 21 16:12:52 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a repost of a post I put on the forums for the Blastershot Launcher because the latest posts seemed to have been all about whining about the graphics... <br /><br />I'm kinda wondering if the Launcher is better then the Striker's Mark now... <br /><br />Striker's Mark <br />69 - 129 Damage Speed 2.50 <br />(39.6 damage per second) <br />Requires Level 60 <br />Passive: +22 Attack Power. <br />Passive: Improves your chance to hit by 1%. <br /><br />vs <br /><br />Blastershot Launcher <br />73 - 136 Damage Speed 2.60 <br />(40.2 damage per second) <br />+6 Stamina <br />Requires Level 60 <br />Passive: Improves your chance to get a critical strike by 1% <br /><br />While the mark has the +attk power, this is a tad slower now and has higher burst damage along with higher base DPS (before you factor in the attk power) Add on the chance to crit vs chance to hit... <br /><br />Personally, i'd take either. But this is really close now as to which is better. <br /><br />Pre patch i'd say the mark, just because it was faster... Now though, with only a .1 speed difference.<br /><br />Assuming the Launcher was around pre-patch that is... I have never really looked up endgame guns, as i'm more a bow hunter for their speed. Burst damage is great, but I prefer a more sustained damage... Like a DoT but w/o the debuff.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To all you people arguing back and forth this and that, let it go for a couple reasons, althought hunters are sometimes notorious for jacking 2hers from a class that would use it more OFTEN, you definitely do not use a bow more often than a hunter uses melee, and while you could use the stats, get a gorewood or a stat bow from the auction house and stop being a !@#$. Thats a fact. Now that being said... Warriors you would never get a chance to &quot;roll&quot; on this like you all are claiming to want to do, because the fact of the matter is if your guild is killing Mag your most likely well beyond rolling and probably into DKP, if your still using the kiddie rolling system however, feel free to !@#$%^ it up and take a throw at those dice, hope you dont win tho because hunters arent the only ones going to be upset if you do.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this last night, as a hunter.<br /><br />At this time we're not at Major Domo yet and luckily our raid leader understood better than a lot of people on here that a hunter's ranged weapon is HIS PRIMARY WEAPON, not something to show off for stats. The attack power counts for ranged and the chance to hit is very nice for those 63 elites and a small increase in dmg, so even though a warrior rolled higher than me I was allowed to take it.<br /><br />I just feel bad for hunters that are in guilds that don't know how to treat the class with a little respect. Sure, we get our epic bow quest, but that depends on two drops and a pretty nasty questline before we're allowed to wield it.. so in the meantime, what would you rather have? A hunter with more DPS or a warrior/rogue having a shiny epic to show off for a slight increase in attack power?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>We were in MC, I had hardly any DKP left because I got the wristguards of true flight from DOMO on Saturday. Seemed like every Rogue and Warr in the guild rolled on it. I was quite pleased when an officer spoke up and said Guild Hunters get priority. I won it, and immediatly after the run put a sniper scope on it, I was previously using BloodSeeker, the damage of the shots looks to be about the same, I see aimed crits in the 2500-2600 range and white crits in the 900-1100 range, but it is MUCH faster than Bloodseeker.<br /><br />Only drawback I see, is that I might have to carry more arrows when I do runs.<br /><br />Plus it looks really sweet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Actually that epic bow/staff thing MAY exist... So far no one is supposed to have completed the epic quest on test, however someone did post pics to the reward and was banned for it. As were people who posted links gotten from those. As such, it would be hard to find these pictures elsewhere, but alla is probably a little less picky about that kind of thing. So, it very well could be the epic reward. There are certainly items out there that transform when used... <br /><br />Edit: TO clarify I was saying since some people were banned I think its safe to say that they were able to hack into the quests and get the REAL reward on some private server. However since blizzard deleted these posts with the links to the pics before I could personally see them, I can't say whether the pics posted are the same or not.<br /><br />Edit 2: Also looking around on the forums some more (in a thread that brought me to this item) it seems the epic reward is a 44dps bow... <br /><br />Edited, Fri Apr 15 05:54:16 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dude, YOU need to get a clue. It depends on the raid whether they use a point system or not. Not everyone uses point systems. Also, saying that if you don't use a point system your most likely not going to get past magmadar is total BS. A point system does NOT change the skill of players. Heck, one of the main runners of MC on my server have only just now started up a point system. They have been killing DOMO for MONTHS. Like I said, a point system does not change the skill of players... Just because you start a point system doesn't mean that your skill goes up. I know of some people who run with a point system on my server and can't even get past magmadar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ProdromusHarv</b></h3>I swear the drop rate of this bow is bugged in Classic.<br />My raid has been killing Magmadar since week 3 of Classic and we have seen this bow drop once, in comparison to <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17072/blastershot-launcher">Blastershot Launcher</a> which has dropped 6 times despite having supposedly similar drop rates. <br />In addition to that, when talking to other guilds and commonly inspecting other Rogues and Warriors, I see <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17072/blastershot-launcher">Blastershot Launcher</a> way more frequently than Striker's Mark. <br />I guess the irony of having less Hunters in Classic who are all now aware to just wait for <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18703/ancient-petrified-leaf">Leaf</a> so never complain, is that the bow just never drops.</div>
