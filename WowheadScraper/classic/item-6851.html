<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok.. first of all.. get this .. fire elementals by thoradins wall drop the BURNING charms.. crazy huh? water elementals..&nbsp; drop the cresting the circle of binding they are at is near hammerfall.. thundering charms? you guessed it.. thundering exiles.. lil wind elementals somewhat southeast of Refuge point I guess? it's right by the spirit healer and all that, that one.. rumbling exiles are nothing.. and yes.. the thundering charms seem to be somewhat rare for some reason</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You dont want to kill earth elementals. You want the fire, water, and thunder charms. The water charms are just west of hammerfall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>there is a cauldron nearby the quest giver that you put the charms into. just read the quest! or the scroll or w/e he gives you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>u know theres not much difference between the corpsemaker and the whirlwind axe</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, i read some replies, but how many of each are needed?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest starts of at SW (warrior trainer) to begin with and has taken most the day.&nbsp; what prompted me was that i was level 35 and got drilled by a level 33 warrior with the axe. He said go to fray island to begin with, but SW is the start. After spending 2 hours by my self in gankville (STV) I manage to get the 30 tasks required. I bought the liferoot from the AH and thought WTF when having to get the charm things from the elementals in arathi highlands.&nbsp; I thought blow this and pulled my hunter out to do the job. that took an hour as the drop rate was pathetic and some bastard mage got me twice.&nbsp; After getting all the stuff i went up and tried it out and got wipped of the earth. Paid a 60 rogue 15g to do the job in the end.<br />I hope its worth it! Im sure it will be its a nice looking axe. server just went down so havent had a chance to try it :P.&nbsp; Although its taken all day ive done a level no worries as the xp is great.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where do I go to make the essence of the exile?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>8x fire<br />8x thunder<br />8x water<br /><br />if you get more charms you can use them killing other elementals. for example the charms you get from water elementals can kill fire elementals in 1,2 second :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well the Thundering, were the ones with lowest droprate(i thought), foolish enough were the cresting charms.. the real freaking lowest droprate ... i kille fozruk 4 times .. (btw were 60 shaman when grinding).. then the burning, dropped on every 2e mob, incredible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have the 8 charms from each, but it is showing 0/1 in the charm section on the quest. What do i need to do to make the 0/1 turn to 1/1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's difficult to find one good explanation in here, I'll try:<br /><br />1. Liferoot from around the river where you got the quest (AH if you aren't herbalist)<br /><br />2. Bloodscalp Tusks from Bloodscalps in Strangletorn Vale (ok drop rate!)<br /><br />3. Essence of Exile. This is the hard part! - You are now looking for CHARMS (not any elixir) you are looking for: <br />8 x Thundering Charms, <br />8 x Burning Charms <br />&amp; <br />8 x Cresting Charms <br /><br />And they can be found at 52.51, 25.31 &amp; 66.30 in Arathi Highlands (You'll have to kill 28-29lvl elementals to get the charms, and the drop rate is pretty lousy!)<br /><br />When you've got all the parts return to Bath'rah the Windwatcher in Alterac. Downside his hut you'll find a cooking-pot, right click it, and it'll make your Essence of Exile, when you've got it, return the quest to Bath'rah. He will now run a few yards, just follow him, and he will soon summon the cyclonian! - Now all you have to do is kill this lvl 40 Elite Cyclonian, and loot it's Heart, then walk back to Bath'rah, and choose your weapon (They are all pretty outstanding!)<br /><br />Hope it clears something up :D<br /><br />(I did at lvl 35, with help, both to kill elementals and to kill the cyclonian, from a lvl 54 Shaman - And it wasn't hard with him helping, but I sure couldn't have done it without his help!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Don't forget to click on the rock in the middle of each ring, they also produce the burning, thundering and cresting keys you will need for another simular quest.<br />This way you don't have to go back again and waste time on grinding elements that 4 out of 5 never leave drops at all.<br />I would not have minded these quests had there been some loot. but as it seems with my Lvl 33 to lvl 45 Tauren Warrior, Elementals and Dino's do not produce much loot, other than the quest drops, which they seem to hold back alot.<br />I find that buying them on AH beats the boredom of grinding and grinding and grinding.<br />but AH does not produce the XP and the Weapons points that grinding does.<br />so yes a lvl 60 friend is helpful but it is better if you go in a likewise well lvled group.<br />Less xp more weapons points and the loot is better.<br />by lvl 40 alot of quests are group quest, so it is better to practise group sessions as low as lvl 30 at the begining of this quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>do i really need 8 of each one to actually do this quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This quest chain actualy starts in SW for alliance and I believe UC for Horde, at the warrior trainer (when you reach level 30). You are sent to an Island off the coast of the barrens to get your berserker stance. Once you finish that, you get a quest sending you to Alterac MT. <br /><br />You can find the Troll in question by following the river north. He is on the right hand side at a hut. Thehut sits back away from the river, but you can easily see it from the river.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 7th 2006 at 2:20pm PST by Gnoshfurt</i></div>
