So unless you have a trusted friend to make the hammer for you, it will cost you 9 total Ingots.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Used in the Sulfuron Hammer recipe, go look it up on allakhazam (9 sulfuron ingots, 20 dark iron ingots, 50 arcanite ingots, 10 fiery and 10 lava cores and the list goes on)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a key component in crafting the first legendary weapon in World of WarCraft: Sulfurian. It is Ragnaros' Legendary Hammer, but its reagents cost a total of over 6,000 gold.<br /><br />edit: you have to make a sulferon hammer and combind it a legendary item from Ragnaros to make it =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the guild may have decided that the one who makes the mace get all regents, becouse a guild is suposed to cooparate in instances! so it is possible to get the mace within a year!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Every post here is flawed.<br /><br />Technically, it only requires 8 Sulfuron Ingots, 9 if you can't find someone who can make it (need to turn in 1 for the plans).<br /><br />50 is the number of Arcanite Bars it takes, which is totally different from a Sulfuron Ingot.<br /><br />Have a nice day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok.. just to clear things out.<br /><br />You need to create the Sulfuron Hammer first. Then you combine the Sulfuron Hammer with the Eye of Sulfuras to create the legendary weapon.<br />Any Blacksmith can create the Sulfuron Hammer and the rep with TB has nothing to do with it. <br />All you need are the plans. To get the plans, you need 1 Sulfuron Ingot (drop from Golemagg, Drop rate is pretty low im raiding MC each week since sept 05 (january 06 now) and we only have 2 ingots so far) and you have to talk to the guy from TB in the BRD bar.<br />Once you give him the ingot, he gets a boner and the plans to create the Sulfuron Hammer.<br /><br />The mats for the Sulfuron hammer are:<br />8 Sulfuron Ingots, 50 arcanite bars, 20 Dark Iron bars, 25 essences of fire, 10 blood of the mountain, 10 fiery cores and 10 lava cores.<br /><br />In order to create the legendary weapon, you need another legendary drop from Ragnaros (The eye of Sulfuras). The eye of Sulfuras also have&nbsp; a really low drop rate (05% or so). <br /><br />The damn item dropped 1 time from Rag and I was not on the run =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>9 Ingots is alot.... 8 weeks if you are lucky................ transmuting of arcanite is 48 hours for 1 person.... so lets say it takes 2 weeks to get all that.....<br /><br />Basically the en result is that you would have to make a big commitment to get it.....<br /><br />i have only seen 1 person with it.... I am on Illilan server.... and that mace sticks out like a sore thumb.... you are like a god to wheeld that</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can the origional sulfuron hammer be sole bound before you add the eye? or does it have to be untouched?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>that's a good question imo, I would like an answer to that aswell</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it should work even if the sulfuron hammer is souldbound</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, the Sulfuran Hammer can be soulbound before you apply an Eye of Sulfuras to it. You have to get a blacksmith to do it, and it works like when you enchant a piece of gear or put Mithril Spurs on it. <br /><br />Furthermore, if you use the Eye on a Sulfuran Hammer that hasn't been soulbound yet, it will soulbind automatically! You cannot under any circumstances dream of ending up with a Bind on Equip Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros. Blizzard is not that stupid.<br /><br />Finally, if you're a blacksmith reading this and wondering whether you could apply the Eye, you can be relieved in the fact that no perticular type of blacksmith is required. Even armorsmiths can do it.<br /><br />Hope this sheds some light on this grand daddy of legendary weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well you need an ingot from Golemagg so you better be 60 or have a good MC guild and join them at 59.</div>
