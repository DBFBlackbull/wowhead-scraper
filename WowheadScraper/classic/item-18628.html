<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So basically i just need to kill golemagg when in MC with my guild and get the sulfurion ingnot and just take it to the Bar in Blackrock Depths and hand it to the guy of the thorium dudes and he will give me the item (even if im not freindly with him?) to take back to the main thorium place right? plz reply as im farming loads to get money for all the ingredient later and i dont want to waste my time if i can't get the plans.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whoever said that getting that legendary Hammer was easy is insane. You are either going to need ALOT of cash, or alot of free time, because the amount of Arcanite bars you need is rediculous.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Haha. Man you guys are going on and on about how easy and how hard it is. Please if you don't have Sulfuras hand of Ragnaros, then please go and get it to see how hard it is first hand. First of all, I am a weaponsmith lvl 60 orc warrior, it was not that hard to get the supplies to make the original hammer, plus&nbsp; I have an alt how can transmute so I farmed the stuff then sent the stuff over to my alchemist to&nbsp; make arcanite. Realy easy, I spent only 200g on making the hammer. Second, you don't have to be in a guild to get the eye of sulfuras. I whent in there with a group of my friends and they let me have it. Just team with friends not guild.&nbsp; Third, you guys have been saying stuff about having reputation, well you dont need to be anything in order to get it, just dont be under neutral rank with them. Plus the hammer will destroy even the toughest warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's a bind on pickup weapon.. meaning that you have to have BS skill 300 yourself to get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The hammer is not BoP. So yes that is how your supposed to make the first hammer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the first hammer you need is NOT bop- just get it from the ah or a bud or sumone. THEN go to w/e the hell u need for the eye then combine the 2 and POOF POOF POOF Ragnaros!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got this with one of my alts(arms warrior), it was not so hard... even the eye of sulfuras droped on the 2nd time i was there with the warrior... making the epic thing costed only some time for collecting the arcane crystals, and dark iron bars(lucky me im minning), i gave the acrane crystals and the thorium bars to my main char(300/300alchemy) transmuted them and VOALA... the other things were just some more molten core runs and spending a total amount of 53 DKP</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For who said the hammer is BoP so that means u MUST be 300 blacksmith,u're wrong. It's the EASIEST to make the hammer and get the eye yourself, but u can still get the plans and give it to a friend and give him mats to make it or pay him for the mats to make it then he gives ya the BoE hammer, u get the eye and badda-bing badda-boom! U GOT SULFURAS GRATZ U LUCKY GUY!</div>

So do that til honored!<br /> Moving on you need to get to the bar in BRD and the guy is in back on top floor. You need to turn in stacks of 10 Dark Iron ores, Fiery Cores, Core leathers and a few other quest items!<br /> I turned in 600 Dark Iron ore and got 3520in faction.
