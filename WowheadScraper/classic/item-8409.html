<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I checked too. she didn't have it for me either...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As it says &quot;Limited Supply&quot; I sat in the chair and waited about 45 minutes checking every 10-15 minutes and the pattern popped on the leatherworking supplies vendor in the Hinterlands for Alliance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been there two hours now and no dice... do you have to be friendly with the wildhammer clan?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got my recipe from Nioma.&nbsp; I had to camp out for about 45 minutes before it finally spawned.&nbsp; I've heard rumors that it only spawns once a day, but who knows.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Judging how the recipe is uncommon (green) it doesn't spawn as much as a normal limted quantity would. My guess is that is spawns every 2-3days. These are going for 10g on the auction house on Terenas. Good luck getting one =D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>its on a 1 hour timer, checked it up myself</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got them from the guy at Camp Mojeche in Feralas no delay they were just there...<br /><br />Blackrock</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just sat waitin' for about 35min and then it popped,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I camp in the inn; play css and came back within the hour and it already respawn.<br /><br />&quot;For the horde&quot; side anyway</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i only waited 10 mins and it appeared, waited an hour ish while doin other stuff and it was there again.<br />so it must have around an hourly drop rate</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Managed to snag 2 of these recipes off of Nioma in 30 minutes, one for me and another for AH. No need to be friendly with Wildhammer Clan either.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No need to lie, don't understand why you couldn't get it though. Sold one pattern for 6g and another for 2g after I was sick of holding on to it. Maybe I got lucky, sorry you weren't as fortunate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wasen't there when I arrived but appeared within 20 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to the horde vendor in feralas Jangdor Swiftstrider and been checking him now and then. Today when i checked, he had 3 other patterns whom one of them where pattern for living leggings. then BAM! it was gone....? wewt?<br />And im pritty sure no one else than me where at him from the time the pattern where there and when it disappeared =)<br /><br />So its not someone who buys it that makes it despawn, it despawns by it self... =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, for the record, it was a 35 minute wait for me.&nbsp; Take that to mean what you will, but to me that means about an hour wait for it to reset.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found this pattern at 11:37 am on Kul Tiras server today.&nbsp; I hope this helps someone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just sat there for less than 5 minutes and pattern showed up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's definitely not a 24 hour respawn.&nbsp; I got there ~10 pm last night and it showed up at 10:35 for me to buy it.&nbsp; I just logged in 10.5 hours later and there it was again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I flew to Feralas and bought the pattern,i go to eat dinner and 10 minutes later it was up there and also with the Turtle Scale Gloves.&nbsp; Im pretty sure its not on a big reset</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im camping the lil' lassie for ages now, still no Nightscape Shoulders :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bronzebeard server, Alliance side.&nbsp; My 47 hunter needed these shoulders, but I didn't want to pay for them off the AH, so I camped the girl and they didn't come up.&nbsp; Went to bed, logged back in the next morning and there they were!&nbsp; Keep trying, you will get them!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i waited for 45 min before it spawned. i was about to give up after an hour and then, bam, there it was. not sure if its an hour, or just lucky. either way i can say that the supplier in the hinterlands does sell it, and to people who are not friendly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its definately not a days wait. There was one on nioma when I logged in snagged it and then checked again 20 minutes later and she had another one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I already have 3 of these patterns. I just camp and waited every 45mins to check for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Logged on just after 8pm on our server, Thunderhorn (EU), no pattern.&nbsp; Waited about 10 mins, got bored, went questing with some friends.<br /><br />Quested for a couple of hours and was going to hearth back but thought &quot;No, I'll try the dwarven tart again&quot;.&nbsp; Lo and behold, she had the pattern at 22:47, local time.<br /><br />Happy (non)camper.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where for sure do u get this formula?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stories of incredible luck waiting 40 minutes or even 10 minutes are not really helpful..&nbsp; what time did you get the spawn?<br /><br />I waited for four and a half hours.. no pattern.<br />it was very early in the morning and no one else was there.&nbsp; <br /><br />...and yes I would have rather been doing something else..&nbsp; but I want to get this pattern.<br />This is just another grind from a game of grinds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>More than likely the reason you're not finding the pattern is because someone is making life difficult for all of the leatherworkers by camping the limited supply pattern, buying it, then selling it for 300% price increases on AH.<br /><br />:|<br /><br />I'm going to attempt a petition/suggestion to create BoA limited supply patterns to prevent this. On Silvermoon, it's a couple of people who camp most of the more obscure spots and drop an extra 1-6g on the price. Seeing that leatherworking is _not_ profitable on our server, it makes life difficult.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, after reading all those comments I went to Nioma prepared for disappointment... but she had it! Maybe the people on Thunderhorn are just a bit slow... :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol im soooo lucky! camped about 5 min in feralas an got turtle scale gloves, living shoulders and nightscape shoulders! yeah for meeeeeeee!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been camping Niomi for days (that's right, <i>days</i>), and I still have not seen this pattern. This profession really isn't profitable enough to make a green pattern <i>this</i> hard to get.<br /><br />I'm seriously contemplating dropping Leatherworking for Enchanting… =/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a miner/weaponsmith warrior on Shadowsong and had never really heard the Nightscape gear before but after deciding to investigate the Wildhammer Keep I checked over each NPC once and saw this pattern and grabbed it for my fiancee who's a leatherworker =) Apparently these things are available when you least expect it...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone know if only the horde can buy this pattern? I tried going to Worb Strongstitch in Feralas and he was quite obviously a horde leatherworker supplier NPC, something I found out after running in horror when he started attacking me. Anyways, if the alliance can't buy this pattern, then where can we get it? I have seen people wearing this on the alliance side so i'm pretty sure it can be made.</div>
