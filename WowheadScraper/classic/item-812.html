I have not played a hunter, nor have played a druid, warlock or shaman (I have a low lvl mage, tho). Some would say I should not talk. How should I put this...\n\n>>> NOTE: If you play a hunter and consider yourself one, please try very hard not to be offended by this. If you are one of the few hunters who feels they are in the minority, you should know that I have seen DOZENS of hunters do masterful jobs in groups, and I still value the experienced, skillful ones to this day. <<<\n\n1) It is generally common knowledge (or should be, by the time this thing drops in ur group) that a caster's health = their mana. If a priest, mage or lock runs out of mana, they're dead in the water and can't do crap. They wear cloth and have no abilities to save themselves that cost no mana.\n\nIf a hunter runs out of mana, they have the good fortune of using mail, having a pet around, and using any mix of polearms, swords and\/or autoshot (or so I hear). I've run instances where hunters were good at melee, some not so good. But they won't be dead in the water without their mana, that's for sure. So what if I haven't played a hunter to theorize this? I've grouped with them enough to see what makes a group run smoothly.\nConclusion: the mana buff is needed more by casters. \n\n(furthermore, if this staff is so \"perfect\" for Hunters, where the hell is the agility buff? or the increased critical chance? or the increased attack power? casters depend solely on mana)\n\n2) Rolling is usually a big issue, but I thought shouldn't be by the time u see this drop in ur group. Giving precedence to need over \"greed\" is a subjective argument. Clearly anyone who sees this staff will want to roll on it, and Blizzard made it possible for them to do so.\nNeed is based on an upgrade for equipment. I have NEVER grouped with anyone, even a hunter, who said he needed a drop solely for selling to AH - unless no-one (NO-ONE) else rolled Need for upgrade. For that, I consider myself lucky, and sympathize with my fellow casters.\nDown to the point. Try to set aside your POV at the moment.\n\nImagine you are a hunter. You do your job very well. You control your pet, rarely need to revive it, protect your ailing members, perform the best pulls anyone this side of Azeroth has ever seen, and can range for impressive dmg. \nNow further imagine that you, the hunter, are grouping with a motley of random party members. You play to benefit the team as a whole, so the team doesn't wipe, right? Your interests are in seeing your groups run as flawlessly as possible, and to be the best damned hunter ever.\nOff a random unnamed mob this GBS drops. There is a priest, a mage, yourself, a paladin, and a warrior in the party (not a bad combo). Some parties pass and then reroll need, followed by greed. Suppose that is how it goes.\nImagine, then, your options:\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A) Pass so the casters can get the item. The healers could offer an additional greater heal, healing touch (etc) spell in; mages could cast another powerful AoE. Both of these classes will benefit the party as a whole. If you don't have an interest in the welfare of your casters, then you clearly don't know what it means to be a team. (that said, I do not mean to say casters are the center of the universe. but since they are so fragile, they're generally well looked-after.)\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B) Roll greed because you, in fact, NEED that staff. You increase your mana substanitally more than any weapon you've had to date, and you give up your polearms for a staff that gives to agility buff. Or better yet, you sell it on AH, get filthy rich and get your epic mount. It's a valid argument. But how does this benefit your groups? Having an epic mount doesn't help save your party members' lives, doesn't help them live longer, doesn't even help YOU all that much - save for getting around in BG faster and showing off the world how filthy rich u are.\n\nConclusion: Rolling need as an excuse to buy your mount or get more stings is outweighed by the benefit to casters, and therefore outweighed by the benefit to your party. \n\n(furthermore, if you claim that caster won't ever group with you - why not? If a caster has GBS they're gonna be doing pretty good in groups, and why not stick around them?)\n\n>>> Of course, if you are a hunter who doesn't give a rat's ass about grouping as a whole, I would like to say \"hello again.\" Hello again, because we met in Arathi Basin before and you were too busy basking in your own glory that you couldn't care about the team. If you are one of these hunters, gleefully ignore everything I just wrote and go back to ninja'ing items you don't need. <<<\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nRecap: \n\n1) As common as hunters are, experienced (smart) ones make instrumental members in a party\n2) Casters need mana more than hunters do\n3) Casters with lots of mana benefit the party more than a hunter with lots of mana \n4) Casters with lots of mana benefit the party more than a hunter with an epic mount\n5) This weapon is NOT perfect for hunters due to the lack of agility, critical and attack power buffs\n\nI now open myself up to flames, critiques and all the other mumbo jumbo I will never ever care about. I had my 2 cents.\n\n-- Oh and one last thing, I got this staff off a random WPL ghoul drop myself, and though it makes a big difference for any class wielding it, I have made a great many raids, instances and pvper's VERY happy staying alive with the added healing.

Jesus.&nbsp; Calling [i]some[\/i] of you people stupid is an insult to retards.&nbsp; Bind on equip, even for an epic, means it's fair game for [u]anyone in the party[\/u] to roll on, because even those people who can't use it, or mightn't be the best choice for it, can still sell it and apply the proceeds to weapons\/items\/enchants that may be better suited to them.\n\nOr not.&nbsp; They can take the ~250g they make on this tasty little stick and blow it all on Savory Deviate Delight for their friends and a big wedding ceremony in the tram as they marry a Night Elf played by an emo myspace goth chick in some fantastically queer event.&nbsp; They can do this because it's their money, and they're entitled to spend it however they want, because they earned it fair and square by selling an item that (once more for the retards playing the home version) [u]is bind on equip.[\/u]\n\nThe only time it’s uncool for anyone to roll on this (or similar BOEs) is when the loot rules have been agreed upon ahead of time, or as corollaries, it’s a guild run and casters of the appropriate level in the party clearly need such an item, or, if it’s a PUG run, someone has openly stated that they’re farming for the item and would like to roll need on it if and when it drops.&nbsp; As this particular item is fairly rare, however, the chances of the latter happening are slim indeed, particularly given the profound lack of prescient intelligence most of you noobtards evince. \n\nFinally, as for the appropriateness of this weapon as regards hunters, it's a perfectly viable, if not highly desireable weapon, though almost exclusively for those hunters in the 40s twink bracket.&nbsp; \n\nWhy?&nbsp; Well, let's see: hunters crave agility for attack power, stamina for survivability, and intellect for mana.&nbsp; As hunters get into melee fairly often, especially in BGs, they also need to have the ability to lay down a good smack.&nbsp; And as many hunters have points invested in talents that optimize both Raptor and Mongoose strike, this weapon is particularly attractive.&nbsp; \n\n“Oh, but there’s no agi on this weapon,” I hear you whine.&nbsp; Well, suppose the hunter has other items that are exclusively agility enhanced, like bracers of agility, a chestpiece of agility, a helm of agility.&nbsp; In that case, a hunter needs Int from another item.&nbsp; And this weapon is a veritable wellspring of Int, and thus mana.&nbsp; But it doesn’t stop there.&nbsp; It’s got great stamina, which everyone needs, as well as nature protection, which stacks nicely with the hunter talent Aspect of the Wild.&nbsp; Oh, and as regards the Int available here, marksmanship specced hunters also pick up extra attack power from Int.&nbsp; In the case of this weapon, almost 15 AP.&nbsp; \n\nBut wait, there’s more.\n\nThere are also enchants that can only be put on 2h weapons, just like this one.&nbsp; Enchants like +35 Int., +35 Agi, or the big bad daddy, +70 AP.&nbsp; For an MM hunter, that’s [u]+83 attack power[\/u].&nbsp; Can any of you fugitives from the mental ward possibly fathom what continuous +83 attack power gives to a 49 hunter?&nbsp; That’s right, extra power, particularly if said hunter knows what he’s about, to keep the whiny casters from getting the stuffing knocked out of them every time some mob or PvP foe decides to tear ‘em a new one.&nbsp; Sure, you can make a case for other enchants, they’re either not as potent or proc-based, like Mongoose, and if the hunter’s rushing to the rescue (as they usually do) of some caster getting ventilated by a rogue, then that proc-based effect ain’t gonna enter into the equation until said caster is dead and the rogue is headed for the hunter.\n\nSo, to recap for you intellectually-challenged asshats who don’t understand loot rules, bind on equip items, and for anyone who leveled a nelf hunter to 15 and thinks he knows all about the class: this item is fair game for anyone in the party to roll on, because those who can’t use it can sell it and use the money to buy things they can use.&nbsp; It’s a nice, viable weapon for hunters, particularly MM specced hunters, but even for those hunters whose other items focus on agility and stamina.\n\nNow go back to class; if you didn't eat it all, the paste on your macaroni sculptures should be just about dry.","date":"2007-05-16T22:40:40-05:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"nah this definitely isnt it. if someone needs it as an upgrade, that supersedes your overly justifying self of needing it to \"sell for upgrades\".

Considering it took me just over a day to raise the money (farming AR plans) for them, then, from my own personal experience I'd hardly say it's easier to get Trindlehaven (which was originally my intention).\n\n--\n\nJust to add, the Trindlehaven dropped the day after I bought this.. lmao.\n\nEdited, Wed Jun 22 00:21:44 2005","date":"2005-06-19T05:22:31-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Xeophonix","importedSubject":"Easier?

I don't really see why though, besides the +29 int. If you're lucky enough to have one drop, either sell it for the gold or keep it for the NR, although it's not much. In my opinion I think it's one of those items that are better off being sold.<br /><br />There are plenty of other staves that you will come across in a short amount of time that won't cost you anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jivitz</b></h3>This staff is probably one of the best pre-raid staves to get for any caster. Once it is replaced, I would recommend using this for NR if needed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You greedy bastards always thinking of yourselves. We had this staff drop in BRD last night. I rolled on it being an elem/resto shaman. Our priest rolled on it as well. I won the roll and it dropped into my bag. I then thought about it and gave it to her. It was better for her than me. If you do not understand this now, you never will because you lack the ability to think past I want, I want.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Personally, anytime I am with a group, we roll on BOE items.&nbsp; Most of the time it is junk greens that we will either auction or disenchant.&nbsp; If someone happens to need the item as an upgrade to equipment, then whoever won it (in my opinion) should give up the item, unless of course they need it.&nbsp; But in the case of a Purple BOE, that is extremely rare, as most high end drops are bop from bosses and such.&nbsp; As a mage, I would use this staff in a second.&nbsp; Any caster (Mage, priest, etc.) I would expect to roll on it, as I would.&nbsp; Classes such as hunters, rogues, and warriors really shouldn't be rolling on stuff like that, BOE or not.&nbsp; If it happens to be that no one in group is a primary caster, then yea, I would say roll, but mages and priests should have first crack at it, as they are solely casters.&nbsp; Druids, Shamans, and Hunters all have some other means of attacking besides their mana bar.&nbsp; Warlocks are kind of in the middle, as they have a pet, but do use alot of mana, so if one happened to roll on the item, I wouldnt' think twice of them being greedy.&nbsp; Anyone else who rolls on it and plans to just sell is just asking for future banishment from the community.&nbsp; I have seen another boe purple drop (Icemail Jerkin, something like that) a chest mail piece which although I rolled on because we all asked first about it, I ended up GIVING it to the shaman after I won, as he would benefit more from it, and I'm sure will remember the gesture in the future when we group.&nbsp; A good reputation I find is far more important than selling something for x amount of gold.&nbsp; As a side note, I find most of the comments posted about rolling loot or whatever turn into mud slinging contests, and really just shows your immaturity.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Personally, I wouldn't even THINK of rolling on this staff as a warrior(or if i was any non-caster class). However, a large chunk of the people that play this game..are 12 years old, spoiled rotten brats, and don't know what 'loot courtesy' even is..all they care about is themselves and having lots of gold and l337 equipment...they nevver get far, and usually end up quitting because noone likes them anymore. They rarely get the chance to enjoy the endgame content, MC/Onyxia. So all of you greedy lil lootmongers, enjoy it while it lasts, becuase it won't last :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Orim, 56 Human Priest (Holy), Dalaran<br /><br />I have mixed reactions to this forum, and the fact that I'm playing a primary caster doesn't help my objectivity either. I have not played a hunter, nor have played a druid, warlock or shaman (I have a low lvl mage, tho). Some would say I should not talk. How should I put this...<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; NOTE: If you play a hunter and consider yourself one, please try very hard not to be offended by this. If you are one of the few hunters who feels they are in the minority, you should know that I have seen DOZENS of hunters do masterful jobs in groups, and I still value the experienced, skillful ones to this day. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />1) It is generally common knowledge (or should be, by the time this thing drops in ur group) that a caster's health = their mana. If a priest, mage or lock runs out of mana, they're dead in the water and can't do crap. They wear cloth and have no abilities to save themselves that cost no mana.<br /><br />If a hunter runs out of mana, they have the good fortune of using mail, having a pet around, and using any mix of polearms, swords and/or autoshot (or so I hear). I've run instances where hunters were good at melee, some not so good. But they won't be dead in the water without their mana, that's for sure. So what if I haven't played a hunter to theorize this? I've grouped with them enough to see what makes a group run smoothly.<br />Conclusion: the mana buff is needed more by casters. <br /><br />(furthermore, if this staff is so &quot;perfect&quot; for Hunters, where the hell is the agility buff? or the increased critical chance? or the increased attack power? casters depend solely on mana)<br /><br />2) Rolling is usually a big issue, but I thought shouldn't be by the time u see this drop in ur group. Giving precedence to need over &quot;greed&quot; is a subjective argument. Clearly anyone who sees this staff will want to roll on it, and Blizzard made it possible for them to do so.<br />Need is based on an upgrade for equipment. I have NEVER grouped with anyone, even a hunter, who said he needed a drop solely for selling to AH - unless no-one (NO-ONE) else rolled Need for upgrade. For that, I consider myself lucky, and sympathize with my fellow casters.<br />Down to the point. Try to set aside your POV at the moment.<br /><br />Imagine you are a hunter. You do your job very well. You control your pet, rarely need to revive it, protect your ailing members, perform the best pulls anyone this side of Azeroth has ever seen, and can range for impressive dmg. <br />Now further imagine that you, the hunter, are grouping with a motley of random party members. You play to benefit the team as a whole, so the team doesn't wipe, right? Your interests are in seeing your groups run as flawlessly as possible, and to be the best damned hunter ever.<br />Off a random unnamed mob this GBS drops. There is a priest, a mage, yourself, a paladin, and a warrior in the party (not a bad combo). Some parties pass and then reroll need, followed by greed. Suppose that is how it goes.<br />Imagine, then, your options:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A) Pass so the casters can get the item. The healers could offer an additional greater heal, healing touch (etc) spell in; mages could cast another powerful AoE. Both of these classes will benefit the party as a whole. If you don't have an interest in the welfare of your casters, then you clearly don't know what it means to be a team. (that said, I do not mean to say casters are the center of the universe. but since they are so fragile, they're generally well looked-after.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B) Roll greed because you, in fact, NEED that staff. You increase your mana substanitally more than any weapon you've had to date, and you give up your polearms for a staff that gives to agility buff. Or better yet, you sell it on AH, get filthy rich and get your epic mount. It's a valid argument. But how does this benefit your groups? Having an epic mount doesn't help save your party members' lives, doesn't help them live longer, doesn't even help YOU all that much - save for getting around in BG faster and showing off the world how filthy rich u are.<br /><br />Conclusion: Rolling need as an excuse to buy your mount or get more stings is outweighed by the benefit to casters, and therefore outweighed by the benefit to your party. <br /><br />(furthermore, if you claim that caster won't ever group with you - why not? If a caster has GBS they're gonna be doing pretty good in groups, and why not stick around them?)<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, if you are a hunter who doesn't give a rat's ass about grouping as a whole, I would like to say &quot;hello again.&quot; Hello again, because we met in Arathi Basin before and you were too busy basking in your own glory that you couldn't care about the team. If you are one of these hunters, gleefully ignore everything I just wrote and go back to ninja'ing items you don't need. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />Recap: <br /><br />1) As common as hunters are, experienced (smart) ones make instrumental members in a party<br />2) Casters need mana more than hunters do<br />3) Casters with lots of mana benefit the party more than a hunter with lots of mana <br />4) Casters with lots of mana benefit the party more than a hunter with an epic mount<br />5) This weapon is NOT perfect for hunters due to the lack of agility, critical and attack power buffs<br /><br />I now open myself up to flames, critiques and all the other mumbo jumbo I will never ever care about. I had my 2 cents.<br /><br />-- Oh and one last thing, I got this staff off a random WPL ghoul drop myself, and though it makes a big difference for any class wielding it, I have made a great many raids, instances and pvper's VERY happy staying alive with the added healing. Think about it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It dropped yesterday in Azshara, Nathrezim EU. Was fighting Horde and questing. Have met a random NE Hunter and grouped for getting faster forward with my gnomish mage Benebella. Well, a Blood Elf had this nice present for us.<br /><br />I pressed need and the hunter skipped. Gave him all my money I had with me (30g). Not everyone is reacting like him, I've added him to my friend list. Think he's a true hero :)</div>

Refused to sell it to other group members, who greatly desired it, for a reasonable price of 600-700. He instead wanted to, as he said, rip off some noob for 1000 gold.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on my stance on everyone rolling Need on a BoE Epic. Will never group with this person again.</div>

Luckily, all my party were already heading for UBRS so none got to roll. Awesome caster staff. <br /><br />Oh and I am a 58 hunter... it -never- even crossed my mind that -I- should use it. Why? Agility, Stamina, Strength FTW! Sure Int helps my mana but I have -FREAKIN AUTOSHOT- and a -FREAKIN PET- All hunters that think they should -NEED- this are loser NooBs! Oh and why shouldn't I sell this puppy at 800g and get my epic mount? I have seen Giantstalker !@#$ on AH for @ the same price!<br /><br />Zikes Eldre'Thalas-- Buy it! I want my epic!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What part of <u>bind</u> <u>on</u> <u>equip</u> do you idiots not understand?&nbsp; Jesus.&nbsp; Calling <i>some</i> of you people stupid is an insult to retards.&nbsp; Bind on equip, even for an epic, means it's fair game for <u>anyone in the party</u> to roll on, because even those people who can't use it, or mightn't be the best choice for it, can still sell it and apply the proceeds to weapons/items/enchants that may be better suited to them.<br /><br />Or not.&nbsp; They can take the ~250g they make on this tasty little stick and blow it all on Savory Deviate Delight for their friends and a big wedding ceremony in the tram as they marry a Night Elf played by an emo myspace goth chick in some fantastically queer event.&nbsp; They can do this because it's their money, and they're entitled to spend it however they want, because they earned it fair and square by selling an item that (once more for the retards playing the home version) <u>is bind on equip.</u><br /><br />The only time it’s uncool for anyone to roll on this (or similar BOEs) is when the loot rules have been agreed upon ahead of time, or as corollaries, it’s a guild run and casters of the appropriate level in the party clearly need such an item, or, if it’s a PUG run, someone has openly stated that they’re farming for the item and would like to roll need on it if and when it drops.&nbsp; As this particular item is fairly rare, however, the chances of the latter happening are slim indeed, particularly given the profound lack of prescient intelligence most of you noobtards evince. <br /><br />Finally, as for the appropriateness of this weapon as regards hunters, it's a perfectly viable, if not highly desireable weapon, though almost exclusively for those hunters in the 40s twink bracket.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why?&nbsp; Well, let's see: hunters crave agility for attack power, stamina for survivability, and intellect for mana.&nbsp; As hunters get into melee fairly often, especially in BGs, they also need to have the ability to lay down a good smack.&nbsp; And as many hunters have points invested in talents that optimize both Raptor and Mongoose strike, this weapon is particularly attractive.&nbsp; <br /><br />“Oh, but there’s no agi on this weapon,” I hear you whine.&nbsp; Well, suppose the hunter has other items that are exclusively agility enhanced, like bracers of agility, a chestpiece of agility, a helm of agility.&nbsp; In that case, a hunter needs Int from another item.&nbsp; And this weapon is a veritable wellspring of Int, and thus mana.&nbsp; But it doesn’t stop there.&nbsp; It’s got great stamina, which everyone needs, as well as nature protection, which stacks nicely with the hunter talent Aspect of the Wild.&nbsp; Oh, and as regards the Int available here, marksmanship specced hunters also pick up extra attack power from Int.&nbsp; In the case of this weapon, almost 15 AP.&nbsp; <br /><br />But wait, there’s more.<br /><br />There are also enchants that can only be put on 2h weapons, just like this one.&nbsp; Enchants like +35 Int., +35 Agi, or the big bad daddy, +70 AP.&nbsp; For an MM hunter, that’s <u>+83 attack power</u>.&nbsp; Can any of you fugitives from the mental ward possibly fathom what continuous +83 attack power gives to a 49 hunter?&nbsp; That’s right, extra power, particularly if said hunter knows what he’s about, to keep the whiny casters from getting the stuffing knocked out of them every time some mob or PvP foe decides to tear ‘em a new one.&nbsp; Sure, you can make a case for other enchants, they’re either not as potent or proc-based, like Mongoose, and if the hunter’s rushing to the rescue (as they usually do) of some caster getting ventilated by a rogue, then that proc-based effect ain’t gonna enter into the equation until said caster is dead and the rogue is headed for the hunter.<br /><br />So, to recap for you intellectually-challenged asshats who don’t understand loot rules, bind on equip items, and for anyone who leveled a nelf hunter to 15 and thinks he knows all about the class: this item is fair game for anyone in the party to roll on, because those who can’t use it can sell it and use the money to buy things they can use.&nbsp; It’s a nice, viable weapon for hunters, particularly MM specced hunters, but even for those hunters whose other items focus on agility and stamina.<br /><br />Now go back to class; if you didn't eat it all, the paste on your macaroni sculptures should be just about dry.</div>

I won't deny that it<br />does have great Nature Resistance, but only really<br />good in AQ 40 raids. You don't need alot of resist<br />in AQ 20.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a level 60 druid, restoration-specced. This staff has been my dream weapon ever since I bought WoW but I could never have been able to afford it since it sells for 900-1200 gold on my server. Well, this baby dropped for me when I was least expecting it from a trash mob in the Emperor's room in BRD. Won the roll against our mage and priest and equipped it immediately. Gold comes and goes, but an epic endgame weapon is forever. My only dilemma now is whether to get a +9 INT or +9 SPI enchantment for it.<br /><br />Oh, and like most BoE epic items, this is a random world drop, so there's little point in farming a specific place for it.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jun 9 00:51:10 2005</div>

I've raided him and 5 man stealthed him many of times and it only dropped once and I got outrolled.<br /><br />Warden Staff + Glowing Brightwood I bought on the same day for a combined sum of 700g + 1x AR Plan. Sure, that's probably edging over their worth, but I don't have to worry about weapon upgrades anymore. Considering it took me just over a day to raise the money (farming AR plans) for them, then, from my own personal experience I'd hardly say it's easier to get Trindlehaven (which was originally my intention).<br /><br />--<br /><br />Just to add, the Trindlehaven dropped the day after I bought this.. lmao.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jun 22 00:21:44 2005</div>
