I'm not going to get into great details about the story and what happened to Timolian and the sword; but let me say, it took much traveling and logic to look around and find clues (for example, the river alongside the cave would probebly in real life, flow towards the ocean, so lets see if the 'current' would carry anything down it). A WoW player did all the searching and posted his findings and many people have begun helping him and working together.\n\nA bunch of quests revolving around DM talk about Ashbringer as well, and talk of Neferian in BWL.\n\nRight now the general idea is that there is an legendary drop off Neferain (1% or less) which has to be taken to the elves in DM, then you need to talk to the great Highlord himself (if you try to talk to him normally he says \"I have nothing to say to you.\") Eventaully, everyone is guess that the rest of this simple book will be filled in, and you will be lead to this spot where you can fish Ashbringer.\n\nIt's funny how a silly little book can lead to something this powerful in the world of warcraft.\n\nEDIT: and FYI, Nefarian does have some relevance, because the Highlord of the Scarlet Crusade was imprisoned in a temple for 10,000 years or something, and has had 'encounters' with Neferian in the past (There is some NPC talking and book reading to be done in DM). I'm personally guess that the Highlord of the Scarlet Crusade faught Nafarian 10,000 years ago, and in their battle, lost Ashbringer to Nafarian or something.","date":"2005-10-18T20:24:04-05:00","rating":29,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"it is so cute to read all these messages from people in 2005 contemplating all these Ashbringer titbits","creationdate":"2024-07-21T13:41:21-05:00","id":1697446,"rating":1,"commentid":2639634,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"Muneca","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"johnbonham2","importedSubject":"None really know what you're argueing about"},{"commentv2":1,"number":6,"id":2639646,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I've been following this story for a while, wondering how the investigations were going, and if anything further had been discovered, and guess what happened?\n\nI was grinding AD rep in EPL, and I stopped off to talk to that Alen guy, near Light's Hope Chapel.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did read it and it said summit about a sword... maybe that u can fish for the item its describing sumwhere ? dunno just thinking out loud...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anybody know where to find this book? I've asked in game and nobody knew.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The comment about it dropping from Nefarian is just plain stupid &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />Think about it... &quot;SWORD OF THE <b>SCARLET</b> HIGH LORD&quot;<br /><br />(incase you misinterpret this as the leader of the red dragon flight, Nefarian is the leader of the black dragon flight, think scarlet crusade)<br /><br />Plus.. the stats you posted are more relevent for a GM item than an actual legendary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is a huge thread on the WoW General forums about this and a huge investigation has taken place, and is still in progress.<br /><br />A book can be found in the WPL in cave, a book much like this, that talks of an Archmage named Timolian, who crafted Ashbringer. I'm not going to get into great details about the story and what happened to Timolian and the sword; but let me say, it took much traveling and logic to look around and find clues (for example, the river alongside the cave would probebly in real life, flow towards the ocean, so lets see if the 'current' would carry anything down it). A WoW player did all the searching and posted his findings and many people have begun helping him and working together.<br /><br />A bunch of quests revolving around DM talk about Ashbringer as well, and talk of Neferian in BWL.<br /><br />Right now the general idea is that there is an legendary drop off Neferain (1% or less) which has to be taken to the elves in DM, then you need to talk to the great Highlord himself (if you try to talk to him normally he says &quot;I have nothing to say to you.&quot;) Eventaully, everyone is guess that the rest of this simple book will be filled in, and you will be lead to this spot where you can fish Ashbringer.<br /><br />It's funny how a silly little book can lead to something this powerful in the world of warcraft.<br /><br />EDIT: and FYI, Nefarian does have some relevance, because the Highlord of the Scarlet Crusade was imprisoned in a temple for 10,000 years or something, and has had 'encounters' with Neferian in the past (There is some NPC talking and book reading to be done in DM). I'm personally guess that the Highlord of the Scarlet Crusade faught Nafarian 10,000 years ago, and in their battle, lost Ashbringer to Nafarian or something.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been following this story for a while, wondering how the investigations were going, and if anything further had been discovered, and guess what happened?<br /><br />I was grinding AD rep in EPL, and I stopped off to talk to that Alen guy, near Light's Hope Chapel. He has a line of npc dialog that relates to this subject, that made me laugh my ass off:)<br /><br />Something like &quot;The what? Oh, the ASH-bringer? Never heard of it. Go away and stop bothering me.&quot;<br /><br />They're playing with our minds....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The guy in the little hut near Steamwheedle Port also has Ashbringer dialogue. My guess would be that the weapon will exist at some point, but it ain't there yet. Stuff like this is there to keep peoples interest up:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what is it named and what mob drops it ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;... And so that's where you'll find the legendary sword of the Scarlet Highlord, Ashbringer.<br /><br />Ain't it amazin' what you run into in an ordinary day of fishin'?&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know the name of the Highlord of the Scarlets?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if i were to guess at how the quest would end up and involve fishing, i figure the sword was lost in some sort of incident leading it to be out at sea now or something like that. you'll get on a quest that sends you finding this place at sea where it was lost and only while on this quest can you actually fish it up (like the Darkshore fishing quests) and it'll have a ridiculously small drop rate. then when you catch the &quot;sword&quot; (i assume it won't be the real sword, but the sword in a beat-up state or something and only be a soulbound quest item), you take that beat-up sword along finding where to get it fixed and by whom and then gather assloads of mats and all that fun stuff for that person and then you get the sword. there could be all kinds of intermediate questing in there too, finding clues on the fishing spot or crafter etc. who knows?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Now it doesnt exist in the game, but it drops from one mob in the new instance called naxxramas. Maybe it will be in upcoming patch 1.11</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ashbringer has not been confirmed to be player obtainable through patch 1.11. GMs have been seen with it, and there is a whole lot of talk about ingame, from DM to EPL. On the PTR, a new item has been added called &quot;Corrupted Ashbringer&quot; (its an epic). This item, along with several new very long piecesof dialogue and quotes has led us to believe a few new things:<br /><br />Morgraine of the Scarlet Crusade (from SM) is the son of another Morgraine who was also called &quot;Ashbringer&quot; (he wielded a powerful sword by the same name). The elder Morgraine was the Highlord of the Scarlet Crusade back when it was incorrupt. However, he was betryaed and attacked by Undead. He afterwards turned into a Deathknight and is now a boss in Naxxramas. He still wields Ashbringer to this day (tough it is corrupted), so it will be tough to figure out how so many others know about the sword.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Silly's...the ashbringer is gotten by completing a quest chain that starts with the corrupted ashbringer drop off Highlord Mograine at the end of Naxx and ends in the outlands.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Ashbringer" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Ashbringer</a> for details.<br /><br />As of patch 1.11 you can start the quest, but will not be able to finish it until the expansion.</div>
