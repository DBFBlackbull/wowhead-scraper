<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>362</b></h3>This drops off Ragnaros with a fairly low drop rate. If it does drop, it will drop independent of Rag's normal loot table (meaning you get an extra epic).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>32</b></h3>This is a great weapon for a warrior in battlegrounds. This weapon really shines when you have a dedicated healer so you can plow through people without stopping (generating rage each kill).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7121</b></h3>Drops off Ragnaros, and is a pretty great axe overall in pve, and most beneficial in pvp for a warrior, due to +5% axe talent they can spec in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9029</b></h3>I wouldn't have any other class than a warrior take this, unless the warriors in the raid didn't want it. Why? Simply put, because 150 mana is almost non-existant when compared to 20 rage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8976</b></h3>I agree here. 20 rage is a lot more than 150 mana. It's best for warriors, if no warriors want it it should go to a paladin then an enchantment shaman.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Taiyoumaru</b></h3>As a paladin I'd like to have it for my greedy little self but if a fury/arms warrior would want it, I'd pass. There's alot of other great 2handers for paladins out there anyway. It looks very good tho. As a paladin I wouldn't just look for raw damage myself as getting items with great dps but otherwise statless isn't as efficient.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9029</b></h3>Ryyz: The damage alone on the weapon makes it ideal for every class that can use it, that and the bonus attack power that it gives. <br /><br />However, I stick with what I have said. 20 rage for a warrior, according to what I've seen, is equal to basically 2 thirds of a mortal strike, to a revenge, rend, overpower, heroic strike, and so on. I'm not doubting what you're saying though regarding paladins. <br /><br />And regarding an enhancement shaman, personally I'd prefer something with a proc on it (like Ragnaros's hand, or just about anything with a Chance on hit) and some stats on it. The possibility of having 3 of those procs, okay, 2 of those procs in a row is fun to think of. But hey: high enough damage on a weapon works as well to consider it windfury material.</div>

The pally would rape you.<br /><br />given that if both classes use all the abilities on them, the pally is more than capable of winning or losing to an equally equipped warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The killing blow effect procs from anything, even if you aren't meleeing with the weapon. Using Judgement of Command, Exorcism, Frost Shock, Whateverthe@#%^ Shock etc will give the 150 mana as long as you were the one that got the killing blow.<br /><br />As people have said, the 150 mana is no way comparable to 20 rage. 300 mana maybe, but this weapon in my opinion is much more suited for a PvP/Future grinding warrior. This is coming from a paladin that owns the axe.<br /><br />Also since it hasn't been mentioned, the proc is a green twirl, like the druid regen spell but without the leaves.<br /><br />Screenshot of the weapon proc;<br /><a href="http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/16/spinalreapppppppernh7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/16/spinalreapppppppernh7.jpg</a><br /><br />Paladin with Spinal Reaper;<br /><a href="http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/1856/veolantiepw2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/1856/veolantiepw2.jpg</a><br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 7th 2006 at 6:17am EDT by shiobiki</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>20 rage = a fifth of the total rage bar. 150 mana = not all that much.<br /><br />Also warriors start from 0 rage, which means that it is going to allow them to use an ability they would perhaps not be able to use otherwhise. For a hunter / pally it's not likely it will enable them to use an ability they wouldn't be able to use, but make them regen mana, which is not all that usefull, even if dps is hot for them though..<br /><br />If I was a hunter, I'd personnally prefer to dual wield <a href="/classic/item=18737/bone-slicing-hatchet">Bone Slicing Hatchet</a> with a +15 agi on each or the alterac mace I think.<br /><br />I agree that for pvping pallies this can be good, but for a warrior it's just insane IMO.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Sep 5 20:56:02 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Actually, the dmg difference won't be too high.<br /><br />AR:<br /><br />53.8+(862/14)*3.8 = 438.4<br /><br />SR:<br /><br />74.7+(800/14)*3.4 = 448.3<br /><br />Won't take a genius to see that Arcanite Reaper will work just as fine as this weapon if you got MS build. Also, the more attackpower you have, the less difference will there be in dmg and at some point (around 1800-2000 attackpower), AR will do more dmg.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Im curious to know if the percent that this drops off Rag is truly less than 1%. It seems ridiculous that his random epic drops would have a variance in percent from almost 1% to above 10 and 20% like his other drops.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I own both the Arcanite Reaper and this. I can tell you this does more damage then the AR and it hits more often making dmg output huge, also the proc does work in PvP when you kill a 48+ player.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I also have a level 60 paladin and I use a shield in pvp because it helps me stay alive as I try to heal, which paladins and shaman should put as their #1 priority in both pvp and pve where they have no need of a weapon like this. I used to be reckoning spec until I went to ret so I could buff kings. Damage procs synergize much better with reckoning, and you are much better off with either herald of woe for the int, or damage procs like drake talon cleaver or halberd of smiting. No paladin or shaman should be seen with this weapon, 20 rage is much more benefit than 150 mana which is 1 flash of light for paladins and nothing for shaman, 20 rage lets you kill someone with execute then intercept+hamstring your next target for chain killing. I still think the best thing to do is use a shield because healers are such targets and it gives a lot of damage mitigation and lets you block specials like gouge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Had this for quite a while now, and the weapon hits for about 1100 crits, I've had some 800 SoC dmg with it, and exactly 1000 JoC. (Some epics and blues with STR) You need to finish off the enemy for it to proc, but any dmg does the trick. <br />Zandalar Hero Charm does wonders for the SoC procs on this weapon, but the mana proc might as well not be there... if maybe the 10sec rule wasn't there, it'd be remotely useful, I'd rather see higher mana regen. Oh well.<br /><br />If I could do it again, I'd get the Bonereaver's Edge, but then again, that never drops... If you want a nice pally weapon, check out Herald of Woe. <br /><br />This is definately a weapon better suited for warriors, 150 mana is nothing in my 5k mana pool, but 20 rage is 1/5 of full rage, making it more suited for a warrior.<br /><br />Dev</div>

An effect giving 2% mana regen for 10 seconds or so during combat would make sense, but 150 mana is barely enough for a single flash heal.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Dec 22 00:11:01 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This thing is absurd. A decent (and decently geared) warrior will always have the most killing blows in BGs thanks to execute (and plain old burst damage). For those that don't know, execute is the ability that drains our rage to do lots of damage against an enemy with under 20% health.<br /><br />So the 20 rage upon KB is just sick - I'd take this over Ashkandi or the GM weapons in a heartbeat. The 150 mana is laughable in comparison.<br /><br />Also occured to me that not everyone knows that our rage bars max out at 100. I'd like to say that this makes the equivalent mana regen 800 or something, but it's probably a /little/ lower than that. :)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 12th 2006 at 2:31am EDT by VisDDS</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Isn't it funny how many people are ignorant as to how attack power functions related to weapon speed? I will break it down.<br /><br />14 attack power yields 1 dps with any weapon. In order to gain 1 dps with a 3.4 speed weapon, how much damage do I have to add? You guessed it! 3.4 damage. Now, with a 3.8 speed weapon, how much damage does it take to gain the same amount of dps. Yep, that's right, 3.8 damage.<br /><br />800 base attack power / 14 = amount of dps added to your attack. Multiply this by weapon speed and add it to the mins and maximums of your weapon, apply any weapon masteries, and you have your damage range.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hey all im a pally and about 75% of the time i own horde warriors.. that 25% well they have some help(priests)..anyways.. i have OEB and with SoC can one shot caster and 2 shot rogues.. anywho.. i cant wait to get my hands on this axe.. +40 or so more Top end damage than the OEB equals pretty much death to what ever i hit with SoC proc.. so i can put this to jsut as much use as any warrior.. Always in top 15 DPS for MC and Onyxia..so lets not say that pallys dont deserve this axe.. cause a pally with this axe fights a warior with it.. odds are pally gonna come out on top.. if hes not a noob and knows how to pvp and play his class.. thanks very much.. have a good day! <br /><br />Edited, Fri Nov 11 20:06:40 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a 60 warrior with this, my primary job is dps and tanking in the encounters that require large amounts of tanks(basically 2 things in bwl). I am usually #1-3 on chromaggus and firemaw, #1 nef phase 1, and keep up with the mages/rogues on ebonroc and flamegor. Any shaman/paladin taking this over a dps warrior should lose their raid spot for doing something so selfish. There is a shaman on my server with spinal reaper drake talon cleaver and they sit in his bank because he uses herald of woe, we laugh at that guild a lot.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Jan 3 01:18:39 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>good god, seeing all of you fighting over wich class is better.. just shut the hell up. it all depends on skill. any class can kill any other class if the player knows what he's doing. every class has their own advantages to sneak into another class' disadvantage to make the battle fair. so all you morons calling others noobs because &quot;pallys are better than warriors&quot; or vice versa.. youre a total and utter noob yourself for thinking it relies on the class. so, do every other WoW player a favor, and reroll. ffs this is getting annoying. a pally vs warrior debate in every comments forms<br /><br />if it gives mana, its good for pally, if it gives rage, its good for warrior.<br /><br />im a warrior myself, and to all who say 20 rage isnt useful enough.. youre an idiot and dont know wtf youre talking about. i dont know if 150 mana is good for a pally, so wont comment on that, but i do know that 20 rage is much than enough to finish off a couple of other high level mobs. is it clear now to all you ignorant fools?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i love my spinal in pvp!<br /><br />in duels the proc is useless... but in the situation im in ... which is AB and WSG mostly... after i finish someone off i can quickly intercept or charge with added rage and MS right away... or ill kill someone and then WW ... the 20 rage is useful<br /><br />not to mention its a nice slow 2 hander with a 305 end dmg that crits very nicely... ive gotten 1000+ white dmg and 1600+ MS crits HS Crits land somewhere inbetween!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>effyouzion</b></h3>Underrated PvP weapon for warriors. <br /><br />Normally, using Execute to kill someone leaves you with 0 rage, which is not worth it in large-scale fights where you have multiple targets to kill... but the proc on this weapon will leave you with 20 rage after killing someone with Execute, effectively allowing you to use one of your strongest abilities. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17076/bonereavers-edge">Bonereaver's Edge</a> gets all the hype because it has a proc that makes you hit harder. But this weapon is equally good, IMO. I actually prefer Spinal Reaper on an orc because they get +5 weapon skill with axes.</div>
