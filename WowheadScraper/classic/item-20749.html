They end up costing arounf 3g per charge. IIt is made by enchanters and you obtain the recipe upon hitting honored with the ZG tribe.<br /><br />Also it is a weapon buff so if you die you don't lose the buff. Especially nice for Bosses like Vael where you might attempt him multiple times within 30minutes. Or even if you want to go crazy in a Battleground.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9531</b></h3>Sharpening stones, weightstones and wizard oils do not stack with rockbiter weapon or any other elemental weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>27894</b></h3>Seems much more economical to use superior wizard oil. Sure, you dont get the crit bonus, but you get more +dmg and the recipe doesn't require shards. (By the time you will get 340 skill to make it, you will have a ton of arcane dust lying around)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>althras</b></h3>I can confirm that the 'required level' on this oils is based on the ilevel of the weapon u're putting the temporary item buff on, and not on the required level to use the item. There is no way to tell the ilvl of an item in game without using an addon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This oil is definitly for a Rag try or something like this. You'll not use this on a daily basis. So its not that useless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Know where to farm and what to make to DE and you'll have a regular supply of this and the weaker version at the ready for raids. If this persists through death, you'll have a PvP staple.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Though I was using the lesser version, Im pretty sure I died, got ressurrected and this enchant was still on my weapon. Would make them much more appealing to use if this is true.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think it's like the rouges poison if you enter an instance or leave one it would be gone away. so you better stay dead after a wipe an wait for a rezz. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Do these effects boost priest's healing at all?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I would guess not cause that's what this is for<br /><br /><a href="http://thottbot.org/?i=52421" rel="nofollow">http://thottbot.org/?i=52421</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does this stack. If, say, I have the +30 spell damage enchant on my weapon. Also is there any lvl restricton on it or could a lowbie use it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually is does not only stack with the Spell Power enchant but also potions like Elixir of Shadow Power and Flask of Supreme Power ...which in combination makes you happy that ranged overnuking is not a problem with Ragnaros (it's not like he will move up to you and melee your sorry behind).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was using this in BWL tonight during vael, I died and released and it was gone..<br /><br />Also put it on my weapon before going into ubrs, then inside ubrs it was gone.&nbsp; So yeah.. huge waste there :(<br /><br />This is a problem with poisons and sharpening stones aswell isn't it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This stuff is nice on the Garr fight because it's one of a few buffs that he can't dispell. Buffs from food also aren't dispellable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it is not dispellable because it is applied to your weapon. like shaman's windfury imbue that cannot being dispelled.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it stays on your weapons if you die. but not all the times, if you are inside and instance, you die and relrease spirit, you lose this buff.<br /><br />any time you enter or lreave an instance&nbsp; you will lose this buff. kind of anoying.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have managed to make these with the Honored rep of the Zandalar Tribe. It gives five charges to one oil and are applied to weapons like sharpening stones, and they require some hefty reagents (however, they're not that hard to farm for.) They stay on after death and even after release of spirit/rebirth.<br /><br />Trust me, they're a real hit with the warlocks and mages in my guild. I feel so popular whenever I have this to offer them. &lt;3<br /><br />Don't get them confused with the Brilliant Mana Oil. These are used for magic DPS classes. The mana oil is better for healers and the like.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a wise poster on the mage forums once said,<br /><br />&nbsp; &quot;I'd rather be out of mana at the end of a fight and done 50,000 damage then have 50% mana left and only done 40,000 damage&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm not not raiding yet.&nbsp; Currently farming UBRS with my smallish guild.&nbsp; Decked out in complete Blue/Purple +damage gear.&nbsp; I go balls to the wall as soon as the tank has his sunders in.&nbsp; My frostbolts crit about 1/3 of the time (2/3 of the time when target is frozen) once I have my winters chills at 5 (about 2k per crit).&nbsp; I never draw aggro during boss fights.&nbsp; The only time I draw aggro on normal mobs, is when I'm Mass AoE - DPS'ing, or if I crit 4 times in a row on a single target.<br /><br />I run low on mana during long boss fights, but my Evoc is always up for those circumstances.<br /><br />My name is ALWAYS at the top of that Damage list.&nbsp; Usually beating the rest of the DPS'ers by %20, when they have similar quality gear. <br /><br />Spell Damage &gt; Int IMO.&nbsp; :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it's true that a caster shouldn't always go haywire on dps in raids.<br />However:<br /><br />1) in raids, you usually carry health/mana pots and demonic/dark runes. (life tap if you're a lock)<br /><br />2)although int does add +crit, the amt is minor. Not only that, the chance is also RANDOM. +dmg is ALWAYS there, and tends to surpass +crit in dps over time. +dmg also applies in crit strikes.<br /><br />Now about the oils:<br /><br />1) mana oil can be useful for a dps caster, but +healing is not of any use. also note that it's only 12 mana/5s. now since spr plays a factor in this, the argument is your regen rate/15s +36 (in order to balance the tick regen and oil regen)<br />ie x1+36<br />Now, since it's dps being argued, it's easy to say that spr will be low in comparision to a healer.<br />ie x2+36 and since x1&lt;&lt;x2, it's easier to say that healers benefit more from the 12mana/5s.<br />(personally i never want to hear OOM during a raid.)<br /><br />2)wizard oil is meant for dps. +36dmg and +1crit should say it all. the only thing healers get out of this is the crit chance.<br /><br />Mages and locks, please use wizard oil and don't hold back (unless told otherwise). Priests, healadins, healing shamans, and druids please use mana oil.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this thing realy helps i can hit 1000s with shadow bolt and its not a crit lol helps a ton</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>does the Firestone(greater) removes this +36 dmg n +14 crit rating effect to do +60-90 fire damage chance on weapon?</div>
