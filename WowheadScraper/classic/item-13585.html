Apparently it can be basically anywhere &quot;indoors&quot;. Respawn time was instant, as far as I can tell -- I wandered straight into it after picking it up the first time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thurissan</b></h3>I'll explain it, the Keepsake of Rememberence could be in any house, but higher chances in ones with fireplaces or extinguished fireplaces, there is a chance it could be in the Tower top level, it cannot be in the Syndicate Keep in the main section of Stromgarde</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i found 1 infront of a fireplace by tower on ogre side, dunno if its a static spawn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The book can be found in front of the fireplaces scattered around the castle, both the the open and the closed houses. The book randomly appears at a fireplace, no way to tell which one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I walked around looking at the fireplaces for awhile and didnt see it so I decided to go up the tower on the ogre side and found the book on the top floor next to the chest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>found it 3 times , once on top of tower then in front of two fireplaces. however i couldnt loot it it said no loot to get .. very annoying so i left then thenext day i cannot find it anywhere. very strange</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Also found this at the top of the ogre tower. Small Red book.<br /><br />should check there before going around and checking all the fireplaces.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Went to tower first--no luck.&nbsp; Found book near fireplace in the ogre area, in an open house near the tower.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After looking around for a good 45 min and checking every house what seemed like ten times, as well as the ogre tower, I decided to check the second floor of the closed houses.&nbsp; Well, I found out that the fireplaces are also on the second floor.&nbsp; The book ended up being in the fireplace of a house way back in the corner of the city on the Syndicate side.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i found it on the top floor of the tower<br /><br />it is a RED BOOK on the groud.. random spawn or else...i don't know..=)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found mine on the INSIDE of the fire place in one of the complete houses in the front syndicate area. Don't just run around looking around the floor, make sure you check inside the fireplace, where the wood would normally be.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Top of ogre tower seems to be the common location. I searched all the fireplaces with no results, finally got to top of tower and guess what. There it is. So safe to say that more than likely yer gonna find it in top of tower</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>2 floor houses in syndicate area - check the fireplace in the room on the second floor... very closely.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found mine in one of the burnt out, roofless houses in the Ogre quarter of Stormgarde. Thankfully there were some people questing in the area so I didn't have to kill each and every ogre to approach the fireplaces. I didn't have any special trinkets on to find it either, dispelling the truth from a previous comment.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Today i tried to do this quest, could open the book, but couldn't loot anything&nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt; Reported to GM about the book, it replied that: the Bug is known and will be fixed as soon as possible. I decided to try looting the book with a the Trinket on and voila... There it was Keepsake of Remembrance. (Locations are those what posted above)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found it on the syndicate side, the lower one ( right when you get in stromgarde on the left ), it was in the back two story house, on the second floor in the fireplace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Horde priestess - Made my way all through this using lots of Mind Soothes (despite their low level, killing them is a pain in the ass as far as mana is concerned). After searching the whole area, starting from the Syndicate side (but only open houses and fireplaces) then the Ogre side (fireplaces and up to the tower's top floor) I finally found it in the closed house (far west of the Syndicate side) in the second floor's fireplace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found it on the top floor in the Ogre tower</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>found it next to the ogre twoer, infront of a fireplace</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think you better can search for it near the ogres.<br />Dont waste time behind the castle, but go to the ogre side, and look for it near fireplaces.<br />Its a small red book, and it can be well seen.<br /><br />I found mine 2/3 houses for the tower witouth the trinket equipped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>found it tonight at 28,65; second tier to the left, in an enclosed house on the second floor in the fireplace.&nbsp; Actually INSIDE the fireplace, no on the floor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>05/05/06 - Found at the very top of the ogre tower (red book)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this quest on two different characters. The first time, it spawned at the top of the ogre tower on the west side of Stromgarde. The second time, it was inside a fireplace on the southeast side.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>20,65 is where i found it..its in a mess of ogers. No problem for a level 60..the other is in a fire place where the synidicate like to play. look in one of the dark houses you can go inside its on the top floor i think</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>29,62 In the Syndicate area, upstairs inside a fireplace. Marez Cowl spawns just outside the house.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found mine in 27, 66, at the back of a foundation in a red fireplace.<br />The common theme seems to be that someone tried to burn it :b</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Mine was in a fireplace in the praterion syndicate (sp?) area. Got a couple of lowbies to help me, they needed the badges, so it worked out. They all seem to be in fireplaces.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The most common area is the top of the tower full of Ogre's (Tower of Arathor), but if you can't find it find a class that can speed the process up for you if you aren't one of them already. Lock, Hunter, and Rogue can find these super easy. Lock just abuse Eye of Kilrogg, Rogue is self explanitory, and Hunter uses Eyes of the Beast on a pet with Prowl.<br /><br />Eye of Kilrogg is the most efficient scout as it can't get agro, moves faster than the other 2 options, and has as little agro radius as them as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found mine on the top level of an enclosed house, syndicate area, 2nd tier of stromgarde (top tier w/fountain).&nbsp; I used mind vision to jump around from mob to mob to find it, which was great because as a 60shadow priest battling these 38ish elites was comparable to fighting normal 55-57's.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>from what I hear.. this is a random drop... in a fireplace. I found mine in the ogre side just a drop off the right from the pedistal at the foot of the tower. 18/66 for cords. it is a red book.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is the first time I've failed to find something.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can confirm random fireplace theory. Found mine at coords 27, 65.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>27,66 for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>21,66<br /><br />Opened up house with no roof in the fireplace</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just spent literally 2 hours looking for this, i was going crazy, i even started wondering if it was despawning or something......hours in a level 37 area can do that to a 60, ANYWAY, I found in in the upstairs room of a tavern at 28,64, it was in a fireplace in the upstairs room, and no, it wasnt a red fireplace o.O<br /><br />Other coordinates from thott are 20.66, 27.66, 29.16, 29.62, it is there somewhere, dont go crazy, just be systematic, every room, every fireplace, and you will find it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>after a couple hours wasted checking red fireplaces and the second floor of stanfing houses, i finally found it. At the top of the ogre tower, in the ogre section.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, top of the ogre tower for me too, and respawned in same spot 10 seconds later for my party member.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went after this item today, and after much searching in fireplaces, I finally decided to go up to the top of the Ogre Tower -- Ogre section, The Tower of Arathor -- went to the top, lo.. and behold, there it was.<br /><br />Nope, no fireplace, just sitting there, a small red thing in a corner of the top floor, exactly located at 17,69.<br /><br />It didn't look as big as the one in the picture in the fireplace, it would be possible to miss it if you didn't know it could be there, and were instead searching the fireplaces only.<br /><br />Please also note that this was after a server maintenance, which lends possible credence to the suggestion that it may spawn here first. Possibly. ;)<br /><br />It respawned in the same place once, although not a third time. We didn't search for the new spawn spot, although perhaps if I'm every very bored indeed, it might be interesting to see if there is a pattern to where the thing spawns after twice in the tower.<br /><br />Good luck finding it, it's not hard, and all that Ogres one must go through gave us a good opportunity to skill up a new weapon. ;)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Sep 13th 2006 at 5:48am EDT by Kekkai</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>found it at a fireplace after 10-15 mins<br />im warlock and i ran with soul link around whole area until i found one<br />so u can just run around the mobs dont do alot of dmg to a lvl 60 anyways</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow! I'll save everyone the 3 hour long search I just did. From what I can tell, it spawns in 1 of 3 different places. The Ogre Tower (aka Tower of Aralthar), the house in the syndicate side, or the house in the west side. There are two fireplaces in the houses, check them both. For me it was in the upper one.<br /><br />There, that should take about 5-10 minutes to search those places.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Looked for that ``stupid little book´´ for 30 min ... found it at 20,65 ... at ogre area .. like 4 sec after I looted it it respawned there again .. =)</div>
