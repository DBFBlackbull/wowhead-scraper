After whacking all the priest bosses and Hakkar, we swung by Mandokir and gave him a big hug, so he was nice enough to drop this for us. There were two tanks, both protection specced. The main tank almost always uses a 1-hander and shield, and doesn't use that toon to PvP. The other warrior had already won the Obsidian Edged Blade from Garr in MC (much to my disappointment since I was hoping the Aurastone Hammer would drop instead). Since there were no fury warriors with us, it was open bid to the rest of the raid. The other pally was holy\/protection specced with Aurastone Hammer and shield, and the 3rd pally is still new and has fewer earned DKP than I do.\n\nI'm currently holy 31\/retribution 20 specced to balance out both raiding as healadin and to deal damage in PvP and solo grinding\/farming (I plan on spending my remaining 10 talent points on retribution when the expansion drops after hitting level 70). Luckily, the other pallies don't PvP as much as I do. I did have the opportunity to roll on the HoS one other time it dropped during a ZG raid I was in, and I passed so a full retribution 31 pally could have it (he'd been eyeing it for a while and PvPs more than me). No good deed goes unpunished and I admit that I did have some regrets about passing on the HoS in the first place.\n\nI'm so glad I have it now. Before I've been using the Empyrean Demolisher (epic 1-handed mace off Kazzak world boss in Blasted Lands, luck of the random roll FTW) and Zulian Defender for solo grinding\/farming, PvP, and trash mobs in ZG and MC. While it does ok DPS (for a pally, I won't even get into a debate on how it's better in the hands of a warrior or rogue) I really needed a good 2-hander (Destiny wasn't really cutting it and the Blackhand Doomsaw was alright but wasn't very optimal for a pally with full tier 0.5\/half tier 1 gear) for that extra bit of burst damage dealing.\n\nThe HoS does that in spades. Combined with Seal of Command, crit bonus gear, and the Crusader enchant, it makes a retribution pally a bear in heavy hitting burst damage. Ever since getting the HoS, I'm having a lot more fun in PvP, wrecking pesky Horde with a few well placed strike procs and I can still heal with the best of them when I have to (such as fighting lieutenants, the Captain, and General Drek). If there's one thing that irritates me is people who think they can dictate what my job as a pally should be. I know what to do with the skills I have, whether it's in a raid or PvP, thank you very much.\n\nTo all those who say this weapon shouldn't go to a pally, think again. It's great in the hands of a retribution spec, though it's not quite as effective in the hands of another build of pally. When it procs (and it seems to be very often for me, like a 3rd of the time), the smite damage on the HoS easily stacks with Seal of Command and crits, dealing as much as 1400-1600 damage in a single hit (which is pretty darn good for a pally). We also rely much more on burst damage than others too because Seal of Command is so random when it does go off. Before I've duelled and beaten equally equipped fury specced warriors who were using the HoS against me, and that's even without bubbling myself. Now that I'm using it myself, a fury specced warrior would have to be decked out in BWL\/AQ gear to even stand a chance.\n\nThe one class I can't really understand wanting or wasting DKP on the HoS is the hunter, who rely mainly on ranged attacks. It doesn't have any crit or agility bonuses, and you have to be in melee to even use it, which, in most cases, is counterintuitive and somewhat suicidal for hunters. The only reason I can see a hunter wanting it is the cool factor, and while the HoS is a very distinctive looking weapon, hunters are better off spending their DKP on Mandokir's Sting or equipping weapons with crit and\/or agility bonuses instead.

Should you be in doubt Zul'Gurub is a PvE encounter, and many of the drops in ZG are very decent and will help your guild progress through instances such as MC. In my guild (PvE guild) we don't give a flying #$%^ if you want weapons or items for your personal interests (such as PvP) and that goes for every class. All we care about is progressing through MC so we can encounter BWL as soon as possible. Since paladins do lousy DPS in instances compared to other classes, and since their healing is extremely nice, paladins in our guild have no right to ever get a DPS item if there is a DPS warrior\/other DPS class who needs it and benefits more from it than the paladin. In same way, all items that benefit healers more than other classes, will go to healers. \n\nTo back up our strict loot distribution rules, we also require classes to spec like we feel is the best. Therefore all healing classes are required to spec for maximum healing performance, just like DPS classes are forced to spec into maximum DPS performance (with a few exceptions). We don't care if our members want to \"annihilate\" the opposite faction members in Battlegrounds doing offraiding hours. When all our DPS warriors have Halberd of Smiting or something better, the paladins can need on it if they like.\n\nI am a healing specced Paladin and I have watched many sweet DPS weapons go to DPS warriors. But when I think about the fact that our guild has progressed faster than any other guild on the realm (apart from the really hardcore ones, raiding 7 days a week with only BWL experienced members) I'm happy that we have a loot distribution system like we have.\n\nIf you're a 100% PvE guild then there is no #$%^ing reason why a Paladin should have this over a DPS warrior. If you're a partially PvE\/PvP guild then you will have to consider if you want to progress PvE- or PvP-wise when you plan the loot distribution rules.\n\nMy 2 cents.","date":"2006-08-11T16:38:22-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Forgotmyaccount","importedSubject":"But it is PvE though"},{"commentv2":1,"number":24,"id":2682305,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Got this last night, thought on it a bit before replacing the TUF, but here's the reasoning...and why imo it's worth getting if you have the opportunity.\n\n1) the proc rate after 250 attacks seems to be right at 2%, i had 3 hits recorded by my dps meter and one parry that i noticed scroll by in teh combat log (it's not a spell, it's an extra attack, so can be parried\/dodged).&nbsp; no crits on the proc yet, hits anywhere from 400-700, which are basically the same as my white dmg hits.\n\n2) when you consider #1, it's the closest thing to a comparable sword you can get, without the actual sword part.&nbsp; it basically procs an extra white dmg attack, which is the same thing sword spec does.&nbsp; only difference being polearm spec gives you some extra crit, which you lose if you spec mace with the TUF, of course.\n\n3) the proc CAN trigger hand of justice, one of my decapitates did in fact set one off.&nbsp; so those two stack like sword spec stacks with HOJ, which is also nice.&nbsp; when you do the math including them stacking on each other, you probably get 3-4ish percent chance to proc an extra attack with the HOJ and the weapon's proc.&nbsp; again, not as good as sword spec stacking with HOJ, which gives a little over 7 percent chance, but until you get a sword better than this weapon, it's the next best thing, imo.&nbsp; this is all assuming you're using a HOJ in lieu of blackhand's breadth obviously.&nbsp; if you're not, you need to learn what items are out there and go make a BRD pug with no shammys, no pallys, no rogues, [b]and none of the newbie HUNTERS[\/b] who post on thottbot ;).\n\nthe damage comparison per hit between this and the TUF overall is fairly similar.&nbsp; mortal strike crits top out at about the same, total number of crits slightly higher since you gain 5 from the polearm spec, while only losing two from ditching the TUF.&nbsp; but since it's slightly faster, you're getting more white damage overall, and more swings means more procs, so yeah...\n\neveryone doing ZG would undoubtedly prefer the zin'rokh, but if you're behind a few people in zin'rokh priority and not gonna get it for awhile, this weapon is a definite TUF upgrade until you do get it.\n\nps: mazaxus, if you had any idea how much time and money is spent gearing tanks for raids, you'd realize how idiotic you just demonstrated to all of us that you are.&nbsp; tell you what, how about you spend a good couple weeks of time (and money), putting together mats for dark iron armor, farming worthless instances for rare blues that someone can use to tank with until they get better drops, helping some random noob warrior you recruited to grind CC rep and materials to get nature resist gear and enchants, and while all that is going on go ahead and pay for everyone's repairs while a new tank learns the positioning and switching required to tank in raids, all because you think you need a cool looking weapon to wingclip people for 40 dmg with and someone agreed with you, which results in your tanks jumping ship to go join some other guild who lets them have the gear they earned.\n\nbetter yet, how about you stick to afk'ing with trueshot and auto-shot on in those UBRS pugs, something tells me that's the extent of your experience in this game.","date":"2006-08-11T16:38:22-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"xayd","importedSubject":"this vs tuf vs others..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":25,"id":2682314,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I play a pally with 5\/8 judgement... and +spell damage does add to the proc, i use spinal reaper for 2 hand... and it's not that great for a pally, but i still want this so bad.","date":"2006-09-17T04:38:22-05:00","rating":5,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"lotion_rogue_pwnz","importedSubject":"i want this"},{"commentv2":1,"number":26,"id":2682327,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Im an arms specced warrior, and i wanna do high damage, so is this the right weapon for me?

I have played a hunter on PvP servers and spent a lot of time killing melee classes (thousands of killing blows in battlegrounds and top kills over half the time even when my faction loses).  How can I do that?  I use all resources at my disposal, but things like engineering and other strategies are beyond the scope of this rebuttal.  Right now let's discuss weapons and the myths about hunter combat from the point of view of a hunter who kills more people in PvP than any competing class:\n\nWrongheaded argument 1:  hunters should only care about stats (particularly agility).  Ha ha!  If you are fighting mobs, a little extra agility makes no difference because mobs are stupid and you just stand back and kill them at your leisure.  If you are fighting PvP and players are so stupid that they let you stand back and shoot them, they will also die and deservedly so.  But most players understand that they should close in and engage you, either casting in your dead zone or doing hand-to-hand combat.  All that agility is worth ZERO at that point, which is where you will find yourself constantly in PvP.\n\nWrongheaded argument 2:  hunters can't\/don't\/shouldn't melee.  See above--everyone will want to melee you (except other hunters).  Since you can't avoid melee, what should you do?  If you have the savage strikes talent (of course you do), your crit chance is raised by 20% for the raptor strike you can do every 6 seconds.  Make it count--get a big, slow weapon that will crit for a lot of damage.  When they close in on you, take that raptor strike swing for +20% crit chance!  Then hit them with a wing clip (which is instant cast) and run.  You want to use a weapon with about a 3.5 second delay so that you get about one second to spam raptor strike every other swing after the cooldown expires.  This will maximize your damage in melee (and it will be a lot with a monster weapon).\n\nWrongheaded argument 3:  Hunters shouldn't get warrior\/rogue weapons.  Since rogues favor fast weapons, I would agree.  I also wouldn't bother with any dual wield combinations (despite the popularity of such things in the hunter world, ostensibly to get the max +30 agility enchanting--see argument 1).  But hunters need the biggest, meanest 2-hand weapon they can wield.  That does put them in conflict with many a mighty warrior.  Okay, if the weapon is better than what a warrior already has, let him have it.  But if the melee guys already have something as good or better, the hunter deserves to get a shot at a good high damage 2-hander.  In a PUG, people are going to be jerks about it.  But a guild is just shooting themselves in the foot to deny a high crit weapon to their hunters, especially if they do PvP.\n\nNow lots of people think that stats are more important than procs for a hunter.  Let's consider why that is not true for PvP.  Critical strikes and procs are both a kind of damage that increases variability.  They don't occur often, but when they do, they skew the fight heavily in your favor if they are BIG.  This is why fast, low damage weapons are worthless to hunters:  your raptor strike can be used once every six seconds no matter how big the crit will be off the weapon, so a fast weapon will crit for less damage about as often as a slow weapon will crit for more damage.\n\nBut what about procs?  Suppose you go for some +stat weapon that raises your average damage a few DPS.  Will you win PvP fights more often?  The answer is NO!  For example, if that rogue or warrior can do 200 DPS and you and your pet can do 160 DPS, raising your DPS to 170 means that they will need a bigger bandage and you will still die every time.  It is true that you will never be able to duel a melee class on their terms and win (just like they aren't going to stand at a distance and win a duel with bows or guns against a hunter).  \n\nSo how do you compensate?   Forget +AGI, that won't win in PvP. Weapon procs and high crit chance is the answer!  Instead of going for +stats, go for weapon procs.  That means getting something like Kang the Decapitator or the Halberd of Smiting and putting fiery enchant or lifesteal on it.  As far as equipment goes, AGI only works on ranged attacks, but generic +AP and +crit helps both.  Even strength is useful for buffing up your melee damage.  Every seven seconds or so you are going to use raptor strike to give melee classes a taste of their own medicine, so make it painful.  Did I mention that no competent hunter is missing the savage strikes talent?\n\nYour strategy should be to do as much damage at range as you can (freezing trap, concussive shot, sic your pet on them, serpent sting, and net-o-matic projector) and then raptor strike for huge crits and possible weapon procs when they get close.  Drop a stick of dynamite or a bomb on them, too.  Make sure you have minor speed increase on your boots instead of +AGI, and consider using goblin or gnomish rocket boots to outmaneuver your opponent.  There is also the rocket helm and harm prevention belt, too.  And the deathray is a fun!  Use wing clip to help you get back out to range.  Kite them and crit them and proc them and they will die!\n\nBut the bottom line is that a big, nasty, 3.5 second melee weapon with a damage proc is a hunter's best friend in PvP.  \n\nObviously warriors are going to lobby against a hunter getting it--but that is motivated by self-interest masquerading as sound advice.  I already said that if your fellow warrior would benefit from a good melee weapon, let them have it.  But if you are in an enlightened guild, you should be able to get a top-of-the-line melee weapon as a hunter.  Melee is not the first choice for combat, but you should be prepared to use it to win a fight against an opponent you have weakened at range.  Melee is the finishing move, rather than the opening move, for hunters.\n\nAs an additional gee whiz comment, let's mention hunter talents in light of PvP and melee.  Most people say that the marksmanship tree is the way to go for maximum DPS.  This is true for carebear PvE hunters who want to reinforce the \"hunters are doormats for melee classes\" image.  But if you are doing PvP, the marksmanship tree is going to be totally worthless (as I said in argument 1, everyone is going to run up to you so you can't shoot them).  What you need is to increase melee damage.  That means improve your pet (the best DOT you have) with the beast mastery talents and getting survivalist skills that increase melee crit chance and damage.\n\n\"But no one will want me in raids if I follow your advice!\" I hear some hunters wailing.  Wake up!  No one wants you in raids anyway, so you are already lucky if you get to go at all.  You will be missing that worthless aura and alittle DPS.  Mages and rogues will actually be glad because it will be easier for them to top the damage meters if you are nerfed.  Just do your part and support the team and collect your epic gear--so you can lay waste to your critics in battlegrounds!  It is much more satisfying to send warriors, rogues, and shaman to the graveyard wondering what happened because, as every imbecile knows, hunters can't melee.","date":"2006-07-27T17:58:49-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I think i need to throw in my 2c here.\n\nLet me just start off with the first \"wrongheaded arguement\"\n[quote]\nWrongheaded argument 1: hunters should only care about stats (particularly agility).

Works a treat and your right it does proc fairly often and the good thing too is that it can crit. <br />I have had about 1.5k crit for the proc and a heroic strike crit as well. Nice bonus damage. Like Mr Hoon said no stats on it so I put crusader on it. +100 str makes a nice buff.<br /><br />Well worth it if you can get it.</div>

However, I always seem to lose to a hunter, because they consists on having to take items to melee with no stats. It bugs me because if your an arms specced warrior or retribution specced paladin, you can decipate crit for insane ammounts. So if your the master looter and in charge please, give paladins and warriors priority first. I am speaking from a hunter point of view.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Won this in my guild's last ZG run over the weekend. After whacking all the priest bosses and Hakkar, we swung by Mandokir and gave him a big hug, so he was nice enough to drop this for us. There were two tanks, both protection specced. The main tank almost always uses a 1-hander and shield, and doesn't use that toon to PvP. The other warrior had already won the Obsidian Edged Blade from Garr in MC (much to my disappointment since I was hoping the Aurastone Hammer would drop instead). Since there were no fury warriors with us, it was open bid to the rest of the raid. The other pally was holy/protection specced with Aurastone Hammer and shield, and the 3rd pally is still new and has fewer earned DKP than I do.<br /><br />I'm currently holy 31/retribution 20 specced to balance out both raiding as healadin and to deal damage in PvP and solo grinding/farming (I plan on spending my remaining 10 talent points on retribution when the expansion drops after hitting level 70). Luckily, the other pallies don't PvP as much as I do. I did have the opportunity to roll on the HoS one other time it dropped during a ZG raid I was in, and I passed so a full retribution 31 pally could have it (he'd been eyeing it for a while and PvPs more than me). No good deed goes unpunished and I admit that I did have some regrets about passing on the HoS in the first place.<br /><br />I'm so glad I have it now. Before I've been using the Empyrean Demolisher (epic 1-handed mace off Kazzak world boss in Blasted Lands, luck of the random roll FTW) and Zulian Defender for solo grinding/farming, PvP, and trash mobs in ZG and MC. While it does ok DPS (for a pally, I won't even get into a debate on how it's better in the hands of a warrior or rogue) I really needed a good 2-hander (Destiny wasn't really cutting it and the Blackhand Doomsaw was alright but wasn't very optimal for a pally with full tier 0.5/half tier 1 gear) for that extra bit of burst damage dealing.<br /><br />The HoS does that in spades. Combined with Seal of Command, crit bonus gear, and the Crusader enchant, it makes a retribution pally a bear in heavy hitting burst damage. Ever since getting the HoS, I'm having a lot more fun in PvP, wrecking pesky Horde with a few well placed strike procs and I can still heal with the best of them when I have to (such as fighting lieutenants, the Captain, and General Drek). If there's one thing that irritates me is people who think they can dictate what my job as a pally should be. I know what to do with the skills I have, whether it's in a raid or PvP, thank you very much.<br /><br />To all those who say this weapon shouldn't go to a pally, think again. It's great in the hands of a retribution spec, though it's not quite as effective in the hands of another build of pally. When it procs (and it seems to be very often for me, like a 3rd of the time), the smite damage on the HoS easily stacks with Seal of Command and crits, dealing as much as 1400-1600 damage in a single hit (which is pretty darn good for a pally). We also rely much more on burst damage than others too because Seal of Command is so random when it does go off. Before I've duelled and beaten equally equipped fury specced warriors who were using the HoS against me, and that's even without bubbling myself. Now that I'm using it myself, a fury specced warrior would have to be decked out in BWL/AQ gear to even stand a chance.<br /><br />The one class I can't really understand wanting or wasting DKP on the HoS is the hunter, who rely mainly on ranged attacks. It doesn't have any crit or agility bonuses, and you have to be in melee to even use it, which, in most cases, is counterintuitive and somewhat suicidal for hunters. The only reason I can see a hunter wanting it is the cool factor, and while the HoS is a very distinctive looking weapon, hunters are better off spending their DKP on Mandokir's Sting or equipping weapons with crit and/or agility bonuses instead. But if they want to roll/bid on it when they have the opportunity, all the more power to them. Just don't complain when the pallies want it too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have no clue why any hunter would want this weapon; this weapon has no stats, and the proc itself is probably so rare that a hunter (who is primarily ranged) would almost never see it happen.<br /><br />This weapon is for anyone who uses a 2 handed weapon for their SOLE method of dealing damage.<br /><br />I have a 60 warrior and a 60 paladin.&nbsp; This would be good on either of them.<br /><br />My warrior is a fury warrior, spec'd for 2h or dual wield.&nbsp; Sometimes I need dual wield for single target dps, sometimes i like 2h for aoe dps.&nbsp; The speed and weapon proc damage for this weapon make it ideal for Fury warriors, as well as polearm spec MS warriors.<br /><br />My paladin is a retribution paladin, spec'd for 2h seal of command.&nbsp; This weapon has a topend of 265 damage, making it hit decently hard with SoC.&nbsp; Add in the damage proc (which can proc soc and vengeance) and this is a serious weapon for the paladin.<br /><br />This weapon has no place in anyone's inventory except for these two classes.</div>

All we care about is progressing through MC so we can encounter BWL as soon as possible. Since paladins do lousy DPS in instances compared to other classes, and since their healing is extremely nice, paladins in our guild have no right to ever get a DPS item if there is a DPS warrior/other DPS class who needs it and benefits more from it than the paladin. In same way, all items that benefit healers more than other classes, will go to healers. <br /><br />To back up our strict loot distribution rules, we also require classes to spec like we feel is the best. Therefore all healing classes are required to spec for maximum healing performance, just like DPS classes are forced to spec into maximum DPS performance (with a few exceptions). We don't care if our members want to &quot;annihilate&quot; the opposite faction members in Battlegrounds doing offraiding hours. When all our DPS warriors have Halberd of Smiting or something better, the paladins can need on it if they like.<br /><br />I am a healing specced Paladin and I have watched many sweet DPS weapons go to DPS warriors. But when I think about the fact that our guild has progressed faster than any other guild on the realm (apart from the really hardcore ones, raiding 7 days a week with only BWL experienced members) I'm happy that we have a loot distribution system like we have.<br /><br />If you're a 100% PvE guild then there is no #$%^ing reason why a Paladin should have this over a DPS warrior. If you're a partially PvE/PvP guild then you will have to consider if you want to progress PvE- or PvP-wise when you plan the loot distribution rules.<br /><br />My 2 cents.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got this last night, thought on it a bit before replacing the TUF, but here's the reasoning...and why imo it's worth getting if you have the opportunity.<br /><br />1) the proc rate after 250 attacks seems to be right at 2%, i had 3 hits recorded by my dps meter and one parry that i noticed scroll by in teh combat log (it's not a spell, it's an extra attack, so can be parried/dodged).&nbsp; no crits on the proc yet, hits anywhere from 400-700, which are basically the same as my white dmg hits.<br /><br />2) when you consider #1, it's the closest thing to a comparable sword you can get, without the actual sword part.&nbsp; it basically procs an extra white dmg attack, which is the same thing sword spec does.&nbsp; only difference being polearm spec gives you some extra crit, which you lose if you spec mace with the TUF, of course.<br /><br />3) the proc CAN trigger hand of justice, one of my decapitates did in fact set one off.&nbsp; so those two stack like sword spec stacks with HOJ, which is also nice.&nbsp; when you do the math including them stacking on each other, you probably get 3-4ish percent chance to proc an extra attack with the HOJ and the weapon's proc.&nbsp; again, not as good as sword spec stacking with HOJ, which gives a little over 7 percent chance, but until you get a sword better than this weapon, it's the next best thing, imo.&nbsp; this is all assuming you're using a HOJ in lieu of blackhand's breadth obviously.&nbsp; if you're not, you need to learn what items are out there and go make a BRD pug with no shammys, no pallys, no rogues, <b>and none of the newbie HUNTERS</b> who post on thottbot ;).<br /><br />the damage comparison per hit between this and the TUF overall is fairly similar.&nbsp; mortal strike crits top out at about the same, total number of crits slightly higher since you gain 5 from the polearm spec, while only losing two from ditching the TUF.&nbsp; but since it's slightly faster, you're getting more white damage overall, and more swings means more procs, so yeah...<br /><br />everyone doing ZG would undoubtedly prefer the zin'rokh, but if you're behind a few people in zin'rokh priority and not gonna get it for awhile, this weapon is a definite TUF upgrade until you do get it.<br /><br />ps: mazaxus, if you had any idea how much time and money is spent gearing tanks for raids, you'd realize how idiotic you just demonstrated to all of us that you are.&nbsp; tell you what, how about you spend a good couple weeks of time (and money), putting together mats for dark iron armor, farming worthless instances for rare blues that someone can use to tank with until they get better drops, helping some random noob warrior you recruited to grind CC rep and materials to get nature resist gear and enchants, and while all that is going on go ahead and pay for everyone's repairs while a new tank learns the positioning and switching required to tank in raids, all because you think you need a cool looking weapon to wingclip people for 40 dmg with and someone agreed with you, which results in your tanks jumping ship to go join some other guild who lets them have the gear they earned.<br /><br />better yet, how about you stick to afk'ing with trueshot and auto-shot on in those UBRS pugs, something tells me that's the extent of your experience in this game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay, I logged on to see if people were discussing the weapon, but no, it devolved into the usual arguement. However, the person who said the base reason for the debate is to reduce the relative DKP cost was quite intuitive.<br /><br />So, aside from that -- I friggin' love this. I don't raid with my warrior as much (there are too many) - so my priest is my main raider. My warrior is blue geared, part valor - that level of item, maybe four purples total including this. This polearm OWNS. I put crusader on it, and started to PVP again...this weapon is a destructive equalizer. yes, it does rely on the proc -- but the proc for me averages 1100 crit in PVP, up to 1600, the proc goes off quite a bit. The weapon itself does good damage, and just looks cool.<br /><br />For a long time I wanted a reaper...but no more. This will do it for me, and has made my warrior at least somewhat of a force to be reckoned with in PVP.<br /><br />That does speak sadly for the game though -- should gear be such a game-changer or breaker?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>wow guys seriously... its just the halberd<br />you guys are writing friggin books on if hunters can roll/bid on it<br />k now this is how priority goes for this item so shut up<br />1. MS Warrior<br />2. Pally<br />3. hunter<br />thats priority(you could probably argue over hunter or pally but this is imo)... a hunter can definitely use this, great for pvp but for pve not so much. so if you are in a guild and ur just starting end game stuff its best if you do priority first imo... being good at pvp does not help your guild what so ever, but if ur in some PuG, roll for that sh*t who gives a sh*t what class you are... if you can use it in any way roll on it. i would its a PuG. <br /><br />damn it... i criticize all of you for arguing about this piece of junk and i get driven in, w/e im not backspacing any of this... <br />respect the priority if you want to progress....<br /><br />P.S. have one of these, i out dps most mages and rogues now, /flex , yeah its pretty kool</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This polearm dropped for me in zg and ye i won it and im an paladin! it works amazingly cause the proc is Holy Damage means if you put seal of crusader on it its great Damage.and yes its 3.50 speed but if you put like seal of crusader its 40% faster. you deal a lil less damage means much more chanes to proc. to i use SoC whit it since i get double hits whit it means 2 hits again to get the proc.and top of that im reckoning means i can get up to 5 attacks means 5 chances of it to proc so thats why i think its better for paladin to take it than Hunters. yes its best for Ms Warriors (not fury tho) since they have many attacks /instant that goes of the proc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok ive read about EVERY post here and i know a warrior friend that has it and Warriors benfit the most from it then hunters then pallys, simply becuase it has a RARE proc and warriors have to most instant attacks out of all 3 and hunters have Raptor strikes(6sec CD), Mongoose bite(again 6sec CD), and wing clip(instant), but MS warriors(i dont even count Fury cuz its not a 2hfury weapon) have MS, hamstring, rend, cleave(not instant but it hits like 4 ppl so there is 4 chances to proc) and Sweeping Strikes, etc. pallys have Auto attack and it has a 3.50 sec attack speed, thats the only reason i say Pallys last but im sure im wrong baout hunters over them. but anyway i can understand hunters using it for PvP cuz no one goes after your pet(and yes im a hunter) but a GOOD hunter can ALWAYS stay away and just take them down or kite them to death cuz hunters will NEVER beat any melee class in melee damage and if you are a hunter and rely on the proc then you should go delete your character and never play this game cuz it will never proc enough to save your a$$ in a melee fight. and also raptor strikes is just about the only worthwhile melee attack for hunters and if your spec'd for it Counter attack but that rarely comes up w/o deterrence goin. so every1 STFU cuz this should be WARRIOR priority</div>

Either they are talkin about only havin the decap occur without the initial hit dmg(kinda like an uber crit) or they are gonna make sure that when it decaps, that proc does cause another proc(which i wouldnt care about caue that never happens really).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I will respond to utherx and feverbloodscalp to explain why hunters would benefit from these kinds of weapons. I have played a hunter on PvP servers and spent a lot of time killing melee classes (thousands of killing blows in battlegrounds and top kills over half the time even when my faction loses). How can I do that? I use all resources at my disposal, but things like engineering and other strategies are beyond the scope of this rebuttal. Right now let's discuss weapons and the myths about hunter combat from the point of view of a hunter who kills more people in PvP than any competing class:<br /><br />Wrongheaded argument 1: hunters should only care about stats (particularly agility). Ha ha! If you are fighting mobs, a little extra agility makes no difference because mobs are stupid and you just stand back and kill them at your leisure. If you are fighting PvP and players are so stupid that they let you stand back and shoot them, they will also die and deservedly so. But most players understand that they should close in and engage you, either casting in your dead zone or doing hand-to-hand combat. All that agility is worth ZERO at that point, which is where you will find yourself constantly in PvP.<br /><br />Wrongheaded argument 2: hunters can't/don't/shouldn't melee. See above--everyone will want to melee you (except other hunters). Since you can't avoid melee, what should you do? If you have the savage strikes talent (of course you do), your crit chance is raised by 20% for the raptor strike you can do every 6 seconds. Make it count--get a big, slow weapon that will crit for a lot of damage. When they close in on you, take that raptor strike swing for +20% crit chance! Then hit them with a wing clip (which is instant cast) and run. You want to use a weapon with about a 3.5 second delay so that you get about one second to spam raptor strike every other swing after the cooldown expires. This will maximize your damage in melee (and it will be a lot with a monster weapon).<br /><br />Wrongheaded argument 3: Hunters shouldn't get warrior/rogue weapons. Since rogues favor fast weapons, I would agree. I also wouldn't bother with any dual wield combinations (despite the popularity of such things in the hunter world, ostensibly to get the max +30 agility enchanting--see argument 1). But hunters need the biggest, meanest 2-hand weapon they can wield. That does put them in conflict with many a mighty warrior. Okay, if the weapon is better than what a warrior already has, let him have it. But if the melee guys already have something as good or better, the hunter deserves to get a shot at a good high damage 2-hander. In a PUG, people are going to be jerks about it. But a guild is just shooting themselves in the foot to deny a high crit weapon to their hunters, especially if they do PvP.<br /><br />Now lots of people think that stats are more important than procs for a hunter. Let's consider why that is not true for PvP. Critical strikes and procs are both a kind of damage that increases variability. They don't occur often, but when they do, they skew the fight heavily in your favor if they are BIG. This is why fast, low damage weapons are worthless to hunters: your raptor strike can be used once every six seconds no matter how big the crit will be off the weapon, so a fast weapon will crit for less damage about as often as a slow weapon will crit for more damage.<br /><br />But what about procs? Suppose you go for some +stat weapon that raises your average damage a few DPS. Will you win PvP fights more often? The answer is NO! For example, if that rogue or warrior can do 200 DPS and you and your pet can do 160 DPS, raising your DPS to 170 means that they will need a bigger bandage and you will still die every time. It is true that you will never be able to duel a melee class on their terms and win (just like they aren't going to stand at a distance and win a duel with bows or guns against a hunter). <br /><br />So how do you compensate? Forget +AGI, that won't win in PvP. Weapon procs and high crit chance is the answer! Instead of going for +stats, go for weapon procs. That means getting something like Kang the Decapitator or the Halberd of Smiting and putting fiery enchant or lifesteal on it. As far as equipment goes, AGI only works on ranged attacks, but generic +AP and +crit helps both. Even strength is useful for buffing up your melee damage. Every seven seconds or so you are going to use raptor strike to give melee classes a taste of their own medicine, so make it painful. Did I mention that no competent hunter is missing the savage strikes talent?<br /><br />Your strategy should be to do as much damage at range as you can (freezing trap, concussive shot, sic your pet on them, serpent sting, and net-o-matic projector) and then raptor strike for huge crits and possible weapon procs when they get close. Drop a stick of dynamite or a bomb on them, too. Make sure you have minor speed increase on your boots instead of +AGI, and consider using goblin or gnomish rocket boots to outmaneuver your opponent. There is also the rocket helm and harm prevention belt, too. And the deathray is a fun! Use wing clip to help you get back out to range. Kite them and crit them and proc them and they will die!<br /><br />But the bottom line is that a big, nasty, 3.5 second melee weapon with a damage proc is a hunter's best friend in PvP. <br /><br />Obviously warriors are going to lobby against a hunter getting it--but that is motivated by self-interest masquerading as sound advice. I already said that if your fellow warrior would benefit from a good melee weapon, let them have it. But if you are in an enlightened guild, you should be able to get a top-of-the-line melee weapon as a hunter. Melee is not the first choice for combat, but you should be prepared to use it to win a fight against an opponent you have weakened at range. Melee is the finishing move, rather than the opening move, for hunters.<br /><br />As an additional gee whiz comment, let's mention hunter talents in light of PvP and melee. Most people say that the marksmanship tree is the way to go for maximum DPS. This is true for carebear PvE hunters who want to reinforce the &quot;hunters are doormats for melee classes&quot; image. But if you are doing PvP, the marksmanship tree is going to be totally worthless (as I said in argument 1, everyone is going to run up to you so you can't shoot them). What you need is to increase melee damage. That means improve your pet (the best DOT you have) with the beast mastery talents and getting survivalist skills that increase melee crit chance and damage.<br /><br />&quot;But no one will want me in raids if I follow your advice!&quot; I hear some hunters wailing. Wake up! No one wants you in raids anyway, so you are already lucky if you get to go at all. You will be missing that worthless aura and alittle DPS. Mages and rogues will actually be glad because it will be easier for them to top the damage meters if you are nerfed. Just do your part and support the team and collect your epic gear--so you can lay waste to your critics in battlegrounds! It is much more satisfying to send warriors, rogues, and shaman to the graveyard wondering what happened because, as every imbecile knows, hunters can't melee.</div>
