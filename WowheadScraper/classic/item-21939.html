<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I saw this at a vendor in Darkwhisper Gorge!<br />You cross the bridge, heading for darkwhisper. <br />Pass the two guards, and go up the road to the Right. in a cave there, it's a vendor that sells this.<br />It costs 50g. you can also by Ankh and that stuff.<br />=D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>58,78 are the cords. I bypassed all the elites and bought mine for 50g. This can be done solo, without fighting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>there are no alternate conversations with the imp, he just says different things before you click to browse his goods, like how some vendor NPCs tell you if you want to haggle, go talk to a goblin. the imp is a reagent vendor that sells reagents in addition to the rod, which is 50 gold. don't be an idiot and waste money on the other stuff like certain other people have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bought mine for 40g. I'm friendly with all 4 goblin factions, though I'm not sure the vendor is aligned with any of them, as the reagents were NOT discounted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the rod for 40g, and 2 Felcloth for 80s each!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can bypass all the elites. Once you cross the bridge, keep going until there are two guards. Go through them, there will be a demon a little after where you're suppose to turn. Be careful, a warlock is right before the cave. So don't run up quickly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Tier_0.5#Winterspring:_Fel_Elemental_Rod" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Tier_0.5#Winterspring:_Fel_Elemental_Rod</a><br /><br />&quot;Purchase the rod from Vi'el for 50g and take it back to Mux.<br /><br />If you buy the rod earlier on in the quest line (before the &quot;Fel Elemental Rod&quot; becomes a needed quest item), Vi'el will sell it to you for 40gold, as Mux suggests he should.&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No - that's not it.&nbsp; I bought mine for 40g and I never knew the things existed until I got the quest to get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, the rod costs 50g even if you cancel the quest, /threat him, /glare him or even if you are friendly with all the goblin factions..don't know how to get it for 40g..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Alliance 60 Paladin<br /><br />Was on that part of the quest.<br /><br />Faction with goblins would be irrelevant seeing as this guy is an imp.<br /><br />Paid 40g.<br /><br />Maybe he randomly changes the price. If you see 50g, try closing the vendor window and reopening it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>40g on test realm, must be random if getting charged 50 and 40, but location is correct, mobs are avoidable</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone keeps saying its 50g or 40g, I reckon it just depends on the timing?<br />It was 40g for me, I had the quest at the time and my rep with the steamwheedle cartel is friendly. But some ppl who have the same rep have to pay 50g... Probably just timing, doesn't matter if you're on the quest or not</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I only payed 40g. And the quest is rather easy. Didnt get any dmg on me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It costs 40g if you do not have the quest to get this item in your log.&nbsp; If you do have the quest in your log it will cost you 50g.&nbsp; So drop the quest, buy it for 40g and get the quest back in Gadgetzan, then turn it in saving 10g.&nbsp; Anyone who says they got it for 40g with the quest in their log is a liar period.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>40 g and i got in going right of pillar then waiting for the felhuond to cross in front of me then ran across up the hill and in simple took me about 3 mins all togehter i am a hunter didn't fiegn once. lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is my 2nd 60 to do this quest and it was 50g the 1st time I did it but 40g this time.&nbsp; They must have finally fixed it in one of the recent patches.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You don't need to fight anyone; it says (elite) but it's easy peasy lemon squeasy :) just keep yourself at the right side to avoid the elite and let the hound walk away before you go into the cave :)<br /><br />Bought the staff for 40g :)<br /><br />Spent alot of money on this quest though :'(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest series costs a butt load of gold and you fly for days to various places, but you get a total of 3 set items along the way. And it leads to 2 other quests ending in Dead Man's Plea in Stratholme. So it was worth doing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I also buyed it for 40g, and im just friendly witht he goblins, and nearly all os my mage friends say they borugh it for 50 g /:.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This thing cost me 40g, while i had the quest, im a horde warrior so the rogue thing is out... might just be random. but it sure in the hell isnt because i got it before i needed it, so the people that are saying that u HAVE to get it before the quest arnt right</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>when i bought this for my rogue's upgrade quest it cost me 50g (that was the same day that the 0.5 armor patch was implemented), but i've just bought it again today whilst doing my priest's upgrade quest and it cost 40g. both were bought during the 'fel elemental rod' part of the quest chain...no idea why the variation in price.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Basically.. I'm a druid (so no class difference) I bought it when I was told to..not at the ectoplasm bit and it only cost me 40g (so its not about what part of the quest u get it at)I think it is just randomly...Anyways dont u have ta pay 40g at the start of this quest aswell?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just got that rode for 40g :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, to settle the whole 50/40G argument, simply read the quest.&nbsp; You are told to make sure he only charges you 40g.&nbsp; He is a shify dealer, so if we wants to charge you 50g then don't buy it.&nbsp; Keep checking back with him until he sells it for 40g.&nbsp; Unless you got 10G to waste.<br /><br />It does NOT matter if you have the quest or not.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a 60 mage (alliance)who has the quest and only paid 40g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well i'll have to agree with the postings that say he's a shady dealer, in my quest log it said nothing about how much to pay, but the quest title is &quot;A Shady Dealer&quot; for pally (dunno if it's the same for other classes or questlines). I'm sure it's random and also probly depends on how much gold you have at the time. I went in with just over 40g and only got charged 40. it's most likely random depending on any number of variables that blizzard has chosen. the only way to be sure really is to empty out your entire inventory and run in there naked with nothing but cash. My geuss is it still won't make a difference, it'll switch between 40-50 just by chance. try going in with less than 50g and see if the little bastard is just trying to get that extra 10g for profit and that maybe if you dont have it he only charges 40g. good luck everyone :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The name of the merchant is Vi'el...do a search and click on the map to see where he is. Hope this helps.</div>
