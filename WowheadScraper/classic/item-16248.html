(Limited Time)<br />Debuff Effect: &quot;Unholy curse&quot;: Physicial damage done reduced by 15. (Presumably for 12 seconds )<br /><br />Screen Shot Note: The black lines through the sword shows the path the skulls take around the weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1903</b></h3>Unfortunately, the enchant effect does not display properly on Last Year's Mutton graphic (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19293">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19293</a>).<br /><br />So much for that 60g in mats :-(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>leuitinet</b></h3>I think it would be a good twink enchant.I think it should be like crusader....Only 'darker'. It should 'chance on hit: grants wielder 120 str, but takes so much life for the power given' Something to match its name</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They arn't orbs, if you get close enough they are screaming skulls flying around your weapon with the green glow trailing from behind them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I used to dual wield weapons with unholy. It procs at least 6-10 times a fight (no joke) with my daggers. The proc just reduces the enemies melee damage done by 15 for 20 seconds. It's not really worth it IMO, but it does look very unique and stands out as much as icy weapons bright glow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those thinking about getting this enchant, DON'T. At least not until Blizz revises how it works. This&nbsp; enchant is totally worthless. Get either Crusader or Life Stealing. Hell, Fiery enchant is much better then this.<br /><br />It reduces damage by 15 not 15%. I does not stack at all. This is the worst high level enchant in the game.<br /><br />The only reason I can see anyone getting this, is for the animated skulls. To me, the effects are just not worth the cost. Only a cloth wearer could really get away with getting this for the effects, as they shouldn't be doing melee anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Aside from the glow, this is just a gimped curse of weakness.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;Aside from the glow, this is just a gimped curse of weakness.&quot;<br /><br />Except it takes no mana and happens automatically and very frequently.&nbsp; Those people that said &quot;get lifestealing or crusader&quot; don't mention that lifestealing and crusader cost ten times as much.&nbsp; If you are fighting a melee who attacks fast, you will receive a few hundred less damage while the enemy is debuffed.&nbsp; This can be especially useful for rogues who are soloing, who can put the debuff on their enemy and then switch to a different weapon with different enchant.<br /><br />And why should the drop rate be changed?&nbsp; Shouldn't&nbsp; there be at least a few things in this game that not everyone has?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just wanted to let you know for those of you that say it doesn't stack, it does.&nbsp; been farming DM W for random things and our tank was using the Cruel Hand of TImmy with Unholy, and we saw it stack 3 times on Illyana Ravenoak.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; just to let warlocks know it stacks with curse of weakness.&nbsp; thats about it, its nice to have when your accidentally in close range with melee class....i thought about this enchant for awhile, i believe it could be useful for a cast if, you use it with the phantom blade.&nbsp; since the phantom blade could be used to stop a vanish, or invisibility and at the same time reduce hit points, along with your curse of weakness.<br /><br />another point, that this could be useful, is that you can switch back your casting dagger.&nbsp; easy as 1,2,3.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I paid 450g for the recipe tonight. I have little doubt that the person who sold it could have gotten more. Yes, the enchant sucks, but it's quite rare, and many people (myself included) have too much money and will put down a fair bit of it to complete their recipe collection. Only BoE recipes which I've seen fewer times are +4 stats and Lifestealing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Will this enchant stack with <br />(Seeping Willow) mace<br />Binds when picked up <br />Two-Hand Mace <br />155 - 233 Damage Speed 3.60 <br />(53.9 damage per second) <br />Durability 100 / 100 <br />Requires Level 58 <br />Chance on hit: Lowers all stats by 20 and deals 20 Nature damage every 3 sec to all enemies within an 8 yard radius of the caster for 30 sec.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was pretty lucky at getting the enchant, only cost me 12g, im a Dis enchanter, so i got 4 large brilliant shards and all i did is buy the essences of undeath and the enchanter asked for 3g to do it... <br /><br />P.S im not a enchanter, a dis enchanter, quick easy and saves time :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does the proc of this enchant work similar to the shaman Stoneskin totem?&nbsp; Stoneskin reduces all physical dmg taken by 27 (highest rank).&nbsp; The reduction takes place before armor is considered however, so in essence, you're never really reducing the dmg taken by 27.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically, is the -15 dmg taken into consideration before or after the armor?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was looking on ah for a nice &lt;19 dagger or 1h sward for my rogue.<br />Found a blue &quot;Night watch shortsword&quot; it had 2 more dammage per second than i had currently with my self made Pearl-handled dagger.<br />So i got it.<br />Put it on and see ther i got a green tail :).<br />Took a closer look and the Unholy enchant was on it.<br />Took a look on thottbot saw the mats needed and :o.<br />And that for just 13g.<br /><br />If the one might ever read this from the Bronzebeard realm who put that thing on AH.<br />You made me a realy happy rogue :D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, the unique visual is gone, and the debuff is still crap compared to other enchants.&nbsp; It now has essentially a purple tinged +wpn damage glow.&nbsp; If you were thinking of getting this for looks, just get the +wpn damage.&nbsp; If you were thinking of getting this to use, and you aren't a 19 or 29 twink, you're wasting your time.&nbsp; Blizz really shoulda made the enchant better vice messing w/ the look IMHO.<br /><br />EDIT 7/1 -&nbsp; The swirling mini-skulls are back for this enchant effect.&nbsp; They showed up on my Phantom Blade.&nbsp; Guess Blizz reconsidered.</div>
