They are easily soloable by a lv60 druid. Just be careful of the Devilsaur's that use fear. My technique is to attack the Devilsaur in bear form then use bash and cast regrowth, then back to bear. You can also use hibernate and then use healing touch.<br /><br />If you don't want to use the Devilsaur Leather in making items it usually sells well on the AH. I can get around 1G per piece on my server (this will vary depending on your server).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Do you skin this or is it actually dropped?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, you have to skin them huge dinos to get the leather</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a druid, I can solo these things without even being hit.&nbsp; Doesn't even use half my mana pool.<br /><br />I just entangle, spam starfire until it breaks, then repeat.&nbsp; I'm a balance druid, so decent damage on em.<br /><br />I've killed heaps of these, never seen the leather drop just from looting them.&nbsp; To take the number I have kill, I have made 11 pairs of gauntlets in the past month, and I've skinned every single piece of leather.&nbsp; So I really can't see how you can get it off just looting...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a 20/31 build (with AR) and I take theese guys on quite easy. And while AR and Evasion is on cooldown, you go look for the next one. Make sure to bring a pvp trinket to break the fear at least once.<br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I solo this fairly easily at 55 (druid).&nbsp; Bear&gt;devilsaur.<br /><br />If you need a heal, bash + hibernate and there's plenty of time for a full heal and tea and crumpets.<br /><br />Nice map, btw.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ALL of them are elite</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a lvl 46 hunter, I wasn't there by myself, I had one of my close lvl 60 frineds come with me. I only died twice becasue i had a lvl 56 on me and no matter what my friend did it wouldn't leave me alone, I skinned them and got one each time. The only problem we had was not being able to find them but that was mainly because there were two other groups looking for them too. They sell great on server 1stack= 50gold<br /><br />O and thanks for the maps of locations guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>oh forgot to mention on my other post that the levels and types of devilsaur (Ironhide Devilsaur, Devilsaur, Tyrant Devilsaur, etc.) change on the routes. So one time it's a level 54 Devilsaur, another time it's a 56 Ironhide.<br /><br />Each of these has their own special thing that they do. I'll update you when I write it down, but here is what I know:<br />1. Fears you<br />2. Knocks back<br />3. Sits there and doesn't do anything special</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I would say the Tyrant fear yes.. the Devilsaur plain white ones hit super hard.. and the Ironhide ones are pretty weak actually.. but wont go down as easy<br /><br />I took on a 54 elite Devilsaur reg and it was still really mean on my bear even when i put my scorpid sting on him... pretty sure he ended up feasting on my bear even after i healed him<br /><br />i would have to warn people to watch out for mobs by tyrant devilsaurs.. they are my hardest to defeat</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My only advice for people doing this, is CLEAR THE AREA. especially with the fear or knockback ones.. I never died to the mob on its own, but you can pick up too many adds and get owned. (Daze ftl)<br /><br />Feral speced druid, in moonkin gear, balanced these mofos :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The only thing hard about these guys, are the surrounding mobs. The easiest one, I believe, are the Ironhide Devilsaurs, for they haven't (so I assume they don't) used any knockback or fear techniques. They will always drop devilsaur leather if skinned. The level skinning you need is based on the level of the devilsaur you're trying to skin.<br /><br />Skinning required = * 5<br /><br />So basically, to skin every single one, you need at least 275. 270 for the level 54 ones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you farm these guys long enough you'll find ways of killing them w/out clearing any surrounding mobs first. All of them have at one point or another a spot where you can pull them safely w/out worrying about other mobs in the area. Just follow them once to see their full path and discover the best place to engage them. This will save you so much time you will have killed your 5th, 6th before the first one had a chance to respawn again. Actually most of em have multiple safe zone spots where they can be engaged w/out adds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Granted these are elites, I can pretty easily take them down as a 57 feral druid. Just make sure you have your stuns ready to go. It's a good idea to stay in bear form most of the time, except when healing yourself obviously. Using roots and well-timed heals is the key. I've farmed 20 in only a few hours, as well as numerous other rugged/thick leather from killing the adds around it. <br /><br />just be careful. the walk back to your body in un'goro is unforgiving</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as a 57 rogue i can solo devilsaurs, just a heads up for anyone wondering the difficulty of the kill</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>2 of us were able to take King Mosh down, me a 60 fury warrior and a 60 priest friend. Was not an easy fight at all. I remember doing it before I had the 40 man gear and it took 5 of us. He is a named elite so it is not wise to under estimate this beast. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol Tyrannodon in the Barrens... I think someone needs to do a little updating &gt;.&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>to craft the devilsaur leggings i need 14 of them and i gues bying them from the AH is not an option since i would end up spending more than i can actually ask for the finite product...in this respect i really think that the prices of reagents is too high. I know u need to kill an elite dinosaur to get one of them but still...who is going to buy your leather at that price? Yes if they forgot to get one and don't want to go back to Un'goro, but how many times that happens?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Good money if you have leatherworking. Then you can farm these and then make Devilsaur leggins.<br /><br />Anyways, the way to farm these (as a druid)<br />Actually you can already do this when you got Starfire rank 5, which lvl50 i think, but higher is better of course.<br /><br />Go sit on 34,41 and wait for the devilsaur to come by (34,41 is a good spot cause he ALWAYS comes by there every 5 or 10 min, and no other mobs are there. so it's a safe spot)<br /><br />Anyways, once he gets there, first you need to get him to come after you. DO NOT USE A DOT ATTACK, i use faery fire (no damage, but its only for taunting it). You could use hibernate if you want, but you mostly dont have the time to cast it.<br /><br />When he comes after you, you need to hibernate him. When he is asleep, use starfire, then hibernate again, and walk away a bit from him, then starfire again.<br />Be sure to stay away from the mobs around (just walk the other way after a while)<br /><br />Anyways, just keep doing that untill he died. Then skin him. And Viola, a Devilsaur leather.<br />I guess you could get 14 of these in under 2 hours, so it's good money (Devilsaur leggins sells for 60-70g, so thats over 30g an hour)<br /><br />Good luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lvl 53 Ice mage, I have soloed the tyrant and the ironhide.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would only recommend hunting for these during non-peak hours. It will be a nightmare otherwise, especially if you can't track them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is the Devilsaur Leather drop when you kill the mobs, or is Skinned?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a combat rogue that would kill (and does) for this set. But is the easiest way really to patrol the Un'goro Crater and &quot;be lucky&quot;? Hits for 400, crits for 800 + fear = bad. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was able to farm this at lvl 53 on my own, is not that hard, at least not for resto druids :P<br /><br />oh btw, i can craft the devilsaur set if u want it, in Mug'thol PST Tyrd.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Feb 20 19:58:20 2006</div>
