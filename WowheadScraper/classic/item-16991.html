Watch as new patients spawn so you can keep track of who's first.  So like if 6 orcs spawn, start healing the first one to pop or just pick one. Then keep going until undead or troll spawns, then get immediately to them when your heal completes.\r\n8.  Don't stop a heal to switch to a different patient!  Just complete your current heal and get immediately next to the more important patient.\r\n\r\n9.  When you see the quest complete, get to the doctor and turn it in ASAP - don't bother to keep healing, and don't just stand around - if you stand there you might end up failing while patients keep dying.\r\n\r\nExample scenario:\r\n6 orcs spawn.  Pick one.  Start healing, and as you heal click on another orc.  Heal completes, click hotkey to start healing another orc. Click on another orc to get ready to heal them.  Continue until a blue troll or undead spawns, click on them to show you're doing them next. Heal priority is Undead>Troll>Orc.  When your orc heal completes, start healing the next patient.  Let that heal complete and click on the next patient in order of priority OR the order they spawned.\r\n\r\nWhen you complete get to the questgiver and turn it in, and congrats.","date":"2021-01-01T10:55:26-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}}];

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is the quest to get a maximum potential skill of 300 first aid. In theramore at the barracks, there is a &quot;surgeon&quot; who will give you a quest to heal critical/badly/injured soldiers. Cast this bandage on them. <br /><br />If they start saying things like &quot;my guts are spilling out&quot;, then heal them first. <br /><br />The soldiers spawn in the beds next to the surgeon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You have to stand facing all but one bed and do it in order.... Critical, Badly, Injured. Let the one bed always die, you should beat the clock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hoard - Critically injured die faster than badly injured with injured lasting the longest. However, all will die if left too long. Don't be tempted to leave an injured too long when a critical soldier apprears.<br /><br />If left, they will die and you will fail. This took me about 5-6 trys before it clicked.<br /><br />Good luck - it's not easy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I didn't heal in any order and completed the quest in my first attempt.&nbsp; Put the bandages on a hot key. Don't worry about the status of the soldiers, and try to stay as close to the middle of the room as possible.&nbsp; I just went left to right, healing all soldiers one way, and then back the other way.&nbsp; I still have 5 bandages left, that means, quest completed and no deaths.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>don't be an dumbass like me.&nbsp; <br /><br />i didn't realize until after like 5 failed attempts that the quest giver gives you special triage bandages to use for this quest instead of whatever bandages you bring.&nbsp; <br /><br />i used up about 15 mageweave and 40 heavy silk bandages.&nbsp; all gone.&nbsp; bye bye!&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lol did the same thing. then i was like wtf i healed those guys and i came here nad read about the bandages and laughed at my stupidity</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>WEll I tried Triage once failed and then when i went to try it again i forgot to destroy my old triage bandages so i didn't have enough. while i was waiting however a paladin comes in and starts to do the quest for himself. And i guess for the 15 he saved they counted for me b/c i was just sitting there waiting to do the quest again. :) quite happy i didnt have to do the quest maybe some of you could try the same? :)Just a thought.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The way I did it easiest.<br /><br />1. Put the triage bandage on a hotkey.<br />2. Stand just behind the doctor where you can see all but one bed.<br />3. Start healing in order. (crit/bad/inj)<br />4. While each bandage is casting, use your mouse to target the next person in order, then click the hotkey the second the last cast finishes.<br /><br />It seems a bit random how many of each type of injured you get. So if you do it over and over, sometimes you will get a set with mostly regular injured and eventually finish the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this at lvl 35. It would not let me click on the bandage. I had to go to the bed click on the person and then click on the bandage I had it setup as a hotkey. Tried 3 time and failed. A very nice NE came in and I got her to group with me and we got it on the first try. Group Group Group! Each time I tried I got more bandage's and man if I could sell them I would have my mount by now.<br />Just wait around untill someone comes in and do it together.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried 3 times, got help and got it done on the first try.<br /><br />Get help.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am level 43 with 210 in first aid. I go to the surgeon's room in the keep in theramore but he doesn't have the quest for me. Am I doing sth wrong?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had to visit the first aid guy at IF before he sent me to Gustav at Theramore... It is easy to do the quest if someone helps you out...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am level 45 with 210 first aid right now. And the surgeon at theramore still does not have the quest for me. I went to IF and talked to the first aid lady there. She didn't send me to the surgeon either. Any other ideas on how you get the quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Firstly, you need to be 225 in First Aid, I am level 36, and have the quest.<br /><br />Secondly this quest bites!<br /><br />:D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For the Horde you can find the surgeon at Hammerfall village at Arathi Highlands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First, use the bandages that are given to you (yes I used heavy silk the first time, d'oh!).&nbsp; Second, tie them to a hot key. Third, hit the V key to view the status of each patient.&nbsp; Then just stand behind the doctor and heal away.<br /><br />Only annoying part is that there is no status of failed patients, and I had a couple that never left.&nbsp; Regardless, got this on the second go around (first time using the Triage bandages).<br /><br />Oh and you have to have exactly 225 first aid to even get the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Funny, I've tried 15 times or so now, still haven't succeeded. I do everything I'm supposed to, following the correct order etc. It is _IMPOSSIBLE_</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>did this and stood at long head of injured. Maybe I can reach them all because I have extended reach? I was in the middle of them and cast the all heal. No dead. Are the bandages worth anything?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>when you hit lvl 225 and are 35 you go to the first aid trainer in ironforge..she gives you the quest to theramore. And that's when you talk to the surgeon and start the Triage quest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As someone pointed out earlier, all soldier types die. Somehow I assumed that the injuries progressed so that a soldier was always critically injured before dying. I'm thinking I read it somewhere, but it ain't so. I watched quite a few badly injured soldiers die--and quickly.<br /><br />Again, as others have pointed out, use a hotkey. And of course use the bandages the doctor gives you. Be fast. My strategy was to attend to critical and badly injured first when possible, but to not spend too much time looking around. Time is of the essence. Luck plays a part as well since the ratio of critically/badly/injured soldiers isn't the same every time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok here is how it worked for me, after multiple tries... (Make sure your first aid is at 225!, no matter what your lvl is!)<br />I placed the triage bandages on my hotbar and then placed my character so I can see and reach most of the beds. Once I am in the process of healing one injured soldier, I already clicked on the next one and used the hot key immediately the one soldier was healed. I did not move my character, I just clicked one on soldier after another and used the hotkey for the bandages. <br />I hope I was able to explain it good enough</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I made a hot key for bandage and stood right between the 1st two beds and healed in order clicking on next patiant while the last was healing. worked great 1st try.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had a lot of problems with this quest in the start, but my 4 time i did it :)<br />And It give good xp :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know if the leftovers from Trial Bandage are good for anything? I still have a few charges left on mine, and the quest giver did not claim it. Can it be used on other NPCs worldwide?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Alliance gets this quest in Thamore or if you want the little xp go to the healer in IF to get a quest to go to him but he will start the quest without it.<br /><br />very hard i needed to do it 5 times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this quest was a pain...but i did it! ...on like my 10th time i swear...good luck...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK, I probably am the worst to ever attain this quest. I mean, I nearly gave up because I couldn't get through it. When I did get through, here's what the trick was.<br /><br />Bind the triage bandage to a key and stand in the middle of the room so you can target all beds without moving. I started by targeting the critical and badly patients but then I switched to whomever had been there the longest, targeting my next patient and hitting the triage key repeatedly until the current patient was complete. I was always moving to the next patient prior to finishing the current.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was easy peasy :) <br /><br />But what about the Trias from the reward?<br />Not worth anything? No use?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I did it at lvl 36 and just having First Aid 225 you can ask for the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elvenpraetor</b></h3>Used for the First Aid quest <a href="/classic/quest=6622/triage">Triage</a> to unlock Artisan First Aid (up to 300). If you complete the quest and have left over charges on this item, it stays in your bags. Safe to delete once the quest is complete!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>scoolio</b></h3>Can you trash the Triage Bandage &quot;after&quot; the quest is complete? I mean is there any reason NOT to trash it when done?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheKruk</b></h3>Quick and easy:<br /><br />1. The questgiver will give you a Triage Bandage. DON'T use your own bandages! Put this on a hotbar slot (like 1) when you accept the quest. Hurry because time is wasting and patients start popping and need healing.<br />2. Hit CTRL+V to show friendly nameplates, if you want to. Not really necessary as you can visually see the different types of patients, and their health bar doesn't go down.<br />3. Get in the center of the room, between the two middle mats and angle your camera so you can see all 6 beds. You can reach all patients and see who spawns.<br />4. Hit 1 (or whatever your hotkey is) when you click on a patient to start healing them. Don't expect their health to drop! Just start healing them and let it complete!<br />5. Let your current heal complete as you click on your next patient to &quot;work ahead&quot; - then when the heal completes, hit 1/your hotkey to start healing the next.<br />6. Heal in this order always: Undead/critical always before all else, then blue trolls/badly injured, then orcs/injured. Orcs will die here and there. Sorry orcs.<br />7. Watch as new patients spawn so you can keep track of who's first. So like if 6 orcs spawn, start healing the first one to pop or just pick one. Then keep going until undead or troll spawns, then get immediately to them when your heal completes.<br />8. Don't stop a heal to switch to a different patient! Just complete your current heal and get immediately next to the more important patient.<br /><br />9. When you see the quest complete, get to the doctor and turn it in ASAP - don't bother to keep healing, and don't just stand around - if you stand there you might end up failing while patients keep dying.<br /><br />Example scenario:<br />6 orcs spawn. Pick one. Start healing, and as you heal click on another orc. Heal completes, click hotkey to start healing another orc. Click on another orc to get ready to heal them. Continue until a blue troll or undead spawns, click on them to show you're doing them next. Heal priority is Undead&gt;Troll&gt;Orc. When your orc heal completes, start healing the next patient. Let that heal complete and click on the next patient in order of priority OR the order they spawned.<br /><br />When you complete get to the questgiver and turn it in, and congrats.</div>
