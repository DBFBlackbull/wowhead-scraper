The drop rates are very low whatever the case, but if you sort the &quot;Dropped by&quot; list according to drop count, you can see that humanoids do seem to drop it about twice as often as other mobs, at least for the Hinterlands beacon. If you're farming for this beacon, focus on one or more of the Vilebranch camps in the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>46 priest.&nbsp; Did this last night with a 48 shaman.&nbsp; As lvl 44 and 45 I found the beacon from a wolf and a troll and couldn't loot it.&nbsp; Just made 46 and was able to loot it.&nbsp; Blizz should add &quot;Youre too low to loot that&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you run into mobs you should whack whatever is attacking the chicken.&nbsp; Dead chicken, quest fails.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can't shield the chicken.&nbsp; I tried.&nbsp; <br /><br />This was my first beacon, but the third for the shaman and sure enough he got the pet mechanical chicken.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ran into two slimes, two stealthed wolves, three owlbeasts and three trolls, in that order.&nbsp; The wolves were one at a time.&nbsp; I think all were 47 or 48.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The drop rate is messed up obviously because you only get the drop once. Once you get the beacon you cannot get it anymore, that is the explanation for the &gt;1% on all the MOB's</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just helped a guildie complete his last 2 of the three beacon escort quests. When he turned the last two in, he got an additional 7000XP and a &quot;pet&quot; escort chicken. So doing all three gives you a bonus. I still need the beacon drop from the Hinterlands to finish my three......so I'm off to do some hunting up there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>on my other char i got feralas one and hinterlands one and never could find the tanaris one now i have got tanaris one and feralas one this char and cant find hnterlands one, weird isnt it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The quest dropped from a wolf in Hinterlands, right outside Agol'watha. I think you can only get this quest once, so if you delete the beacon you're out of luck.<br /><br />Getting to the robo-chicken was the hard part (for my level 44 Hunter, making it past the Jade Oozes etc to the lake east of Agol'watha).<br /><br />I had to search on the forums to find the beacon. Walked all over the place first. Beacon is on the big island rock in the lake.<br /><br />Then, I followed the chicken. Key hint: ride your mount, hang back from the chicken, and then when it runs into trouble (e.g. 3 level 47 Owlbeasts walking down the road), just let it keep walking. It seems that if mobs don't hit *you*, the chicken won't stop walking.<br /><br />I had to kill a level 48 and a level 47 green slime (sludge?), and a level 47 and level 48 Silvermane Stalker (wolf)... I didn't have to mess with the Owlbeasts or the trolls (or the level 50 Snapjaw turtles on the beach which were yellow-mooded so they didn't attack since I didn't bother them).<br /><br />But all in all, not nearly as difficult as I thought it would be... and not as hard as it would have been (impossible) if I had battled every mob that took a swing at the chicken.<br /><br />Good luck...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RestInBeatz</b></h3>Okay, so I've been farming slimes in skulk rock for 3 hours now. Is this confirmed to drop?<br /><br />Edit: Okay I kid you not, it literally dropped on the mob that I was shooting while typing the comment. Confirmed to drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nandonut</b></h3>Might be complete chance, but I was farming slimes for about an hour in total with no drop, and then I figured I'd switch it up so moved over to the Owlbeasts and got the drop within about 4 or 5 of them... Was the Primitive one to be specific</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fetlock</b></h3>Droprate of roughly 1% seems right. I killed 72x <a href="/classic/npc=2924/silvermane-wolf">Silvermane Wolf</a> and 45x <a href="/classic/npc=2927/vicious-owlbeast">Vicious Owlbeast</a> to get the drop from one of the Owlbeats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crazywoman</b></h3>Farmed for 4 hours , killing slimes/elites etc etc.. then i read in forum here to kill owlbeast.. 10-11 kills of them and it dropped :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>br0xx</b></h3>Wanted to post an update relating to current Classic Era servers. For about an year (or more), NPCs have had bugged pathing when they go in/out of water. <br /><br />Naturally, after grinding for at least 3-4 hours I found the beacon (got it from <b>Trolls</b> btw, I farmed Oozes for <i>hours</i> with no luck) and during that time had to go back to sell to vendor twice, and I got to almost 20% durability just from fighting the oozes (with no dying).<br /><br />So, it turns out that the chicken does have to cross a small section of water, which due to the bug leads to the chicken walking down to bedrock and disappearing into the void. This will fail your quest, but what I found is that if I go inside the water and just dive in a bit (the spot where it crosses is very shallow), it won't actually fail the quest. I guess you are closing in on the distance enough to stay in range like that? <br /><br />I ended up finishing the quest, but wanted to give this as a heads up, because there is no sign of Blizzard planning to fix this bug anymore and it may appear like the quest is 100% undoable, but it is still possible to do it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KydFlowz</b></h3>yeah this thing is not dropping. been 4 hours.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ChiChii</b></h3>After killing trolls for 2-3 hours along with the wolves 2-3 hours, getting frustrated due to no luck. Decided to start on the Primitive Owlbeast by the trolls, and second kill the beacon drops... Don't give up y'all</div>
