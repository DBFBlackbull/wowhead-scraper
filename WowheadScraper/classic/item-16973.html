<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dont see my earlier post, but I should have given more detail anyway. The dire pool is actually inside dire maul. there is a pool that looks like a fountain outside, but that is not the one. the dire pool looks like a horse feeding trough (square wooden). The map will goto world view, but the loc I have is 42,68 inside dire maul. when you enter dire maul you will have to go in pretty deep making a right, then left , then left. at the end of the hall you should see the wooden &quot;dire pool&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Once in Eldreth Row area keep going left when possible.&nbsp; Its at the dead end.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Going lef tis correct. ONce you enter the compound jus tkeep going left. This place is diffacultt with 46+ ogres everywhere and dog patrols. If your'e a rogue it's a piece of cake, but not everybody is so fortunate. As stated above, it's a wooden water troph of sorts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is located inside the dire maul tower, to the left once you are in Eldreth Row</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This push it is <b>not</b> inside the Instance (Patch 1.3.0) when you enter Dire Maul it is a small water basin on left side of the floor right before the Instance entries. Coords 42,68</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sry it is not in front of the Instance entries it is in the floor in front of the arena area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found it outside the instance, thru the hall to the T then left at the end, was a normal pool, did a Distract and Done.<br />(no sign of the trough that people are referring to)<br />Suwin.Icecrown<br />&lt;Clan Blackwatch&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those of us without stealthing abilities this IS still possible, however I don't know whats happened because all the ogres I saw were 52,3 &amp; 4 elites, the dogs were 53&amp;54 non elites, luckily I went in at 56 and managed to get there with some timing :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You shouldn't need to fight anything to get the water if you're of a decent level. I followed the above instructions and got there without aggroing one mob (I'm a 58). Yes, it requires you to keep an eye out for the patrols and dodge the elites that line the halls but it can be done. Once I got the water I just hearthed out of there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Exactly as said... go to T in hallway.. then take left. At dead end at two patrol ogres, send in pet and while pet tanks.. fill vial. Did solo at lvl 57 warlock. easy peasy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was able to do this with 55 Priest. Just watch for the dog patrols and use Mind Soothe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>58 pally... didn't fight anything.... just be smart about going along walls and turning corners...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Isnt to hard, indeed...<br /><br />Nicelty prowled the whole way... just to discover that Ive put the empty water vial on the bank... *sigh*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to clarify even further, it's at the end of the left (i.e. west) dead-end corridor just before the huge rectangle area with a bunch of ogres and some elite dragon in an arena. If your level is high enough (I did it at 60 so can't say when it's safe to go) just crawl along the wall and you won't aggro the ogres or the dog patrols.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As was said before, pool is outside instance, go into Dire Maul, and turn left on T-crossroad. It is possible (and easy) to avoid ogres if you are lvl 56. But at the end (where the pool is) there are two 53 elites, too near the pool. So if you are not able to kill/stun them, better do it with party (i killed one and polymorph other, 56 mage)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Perfect direction.&nbsp; Level 55 priest - no agro, no problems.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>instead of heading into the commons from the hallway, continue on down the hallway to the very end. you'll see the pool simply titled Dire Maul pool.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks for the directions. I was able to walk the halls of Dire Maul without attracting aggro but once. I fought until I realized it was a no-win situation and used hamstring to get away from him.<br /><br />I was in and out in minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a 59 Rogue I was able to stealth in without drawing any mobs. Even with being pulled out of stealth to get the water I had no agro.&nbsp; Hearthstoned to IF then flew to turn in quest.&nbsp; Easy as pie.<br />Longest part was having to finish the crystal quest just to get the crystal restore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just did it as a 58 Pally. Rode in all the way to the pool without aggroing a single ogre. Filled the vial and boogyed out the way I came. Easy cheesy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i did the q very easy and i had lucky.<br />first i get into the entrance.<br />you have to go straight away till you see a hall on your minimap if your are in the hallway you have to go straight untill the T comes and turn left.<br />At the end you will see the Dire Pool.<br />Did this q at lvl 57(warrior) with a group, they just came in and asked if they help.(very lucky)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The pool is nowhere to be found...<br />If you turn Left at the &quot;T&quot; intersection, there's a dead end within 20 ft!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It appears that the actual pool has be removed (Patch 1.12). However, i was still able to collect at the coords 42,68<br /><br />Cheers,<br />&nbsp; ~Matt</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sounds stupid, but true. The pool is at 42,68 at the dead end. Go to the green rock and fill your vial.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was in Dire Maul today and had a heck of a time finding the Dire Pool.&nbsp; It must have been a change made in the most recent patch where they changed what the Pool looks like.&nbsp; It did look like a horse trough; now it is a shallow round pool.&nbsp; Think the top of a bird bath.&nbsp; Still in the same location as before, at the end of the left hallway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This q is so stupid....<br />I did it but i didnt saw any pool, all u have to do is to go to the left once u enter Eldreth Row and at the end are 2 elite ogres - dont kill em, just go to the dead end and use the empty flsk and it will work...it worked for me :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I actually found the dire pool at loc 59,45.&nbsp; The directions to it were still correct, though - take a left at the T intersection and go to the end of the hall.&nbsp; If you are high enough, you can skirt around the 2 elites that are near it.&nbsp; Not sure why the loc was different.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The above is all true but you don't fill up at a green rock.&nbsp; The pool is there you just can't see it. <br />It is a the very end of the hall.&nbsp; You can stand beside the green rock and fill your flask!&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its actually wrong to call it a pool! Its definately a large bird bath or baptismal font like stone dish on a pedestal.<br /><br />Its also definately behind the 2 ogres at the end of the 'street'. I wouldnt call it a hall, as I dont believe it has a roof.<br /><br />Also...I went there once and the 'pool' was definately NOT there. Then I went back and it WAS.....so I think its a glitch. The 'pool' obviously morphs into the wall on some renders.<br /><br />I would say...just retrace your steps until it appears...and dont look for a POOL because it certainly aint one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thank you Cerveau - after reading the comments on the quest page I went to DM and spent almost an hour looking.&nbsp; Despite being in exactly the right place I still could not find it.<br /><br />I went outside DM and looked at this page and knew the exact place to be from your picture.<br /><br />The picture was far more helpfull than all of the other posts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok..I read the prev post, and a s a result, got seriously lost looking for either a dead end with an &quot;invisible&quot; place to fill the vial, or a wooden trough. I think the people who posted that info either found alternative locs, or have SERIOUS graphic issues. <br /><br />The Left direction is correct. However..it's not DEEP in DIre Maul, it's RIGHT inside. Enter, go right, and the left to the far end where, lo and behold, there is a stone basin that, when you hover your cursor over, actually says Dire Pool. As a lvl 56 Hunter, I dismissed pet, rode in tracking humanoids, and avoiding as best I could. Had to feign death once, but that's to be expected with so many lvl 56ish elites along the way. Once there, I hugged the walls to the pool, filled, and left. I died though, in very mysterious circumstances. Nothing around, had been hit by a mage, but no DoT...had actually gotten away from him, and wasn't taking any damage, when BAM..dead.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The above post is correct - the place to fill it is not shown in the screen shot above, but instead go into Dire Maul, run past the ogre guards and head left down the corridor to the end where you will see a basin which shows &quot;dire pool&quot; when you mouse over it. <br /><br />I found it a bit hard to get to because of the need to kill ogres, but it should be easy for a hunter or a rogue (being a mage, I used less subtle methods than sneaking)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The pool is far back into dire maul. Continue straight down th patch directly across from the stairs. Follow this until you come to a huge closed wooden door, and take the left path. Follow this and at the very end is a small stone pool.<br /><br />I was able to sneak past everything untill i got to the pool. There, i just summoned my water elemental and pulled the 2 opgres with him, then frostnova'ed em in place. <br /><br />The vial fills very quickly, so all you have to do is gain a free second where they arent hitting you, fill the vial, and then die.<br /><br />Make sure you can right click the empty vial quickly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just filled the vial with my 54 lock and I only had to keep close to the walls and everything went out fine without dying a singel time and just letting my void take agro from th eogres close to the pool. So its pretty easy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item is *not* inside the DM instance.&nbsp; Cartographer reports 43, 69 standing inside the pool.&nbsp; Other mods may report different coords.<br /><br />This looks like a round stone fountain on my puter (not a wooden horse trough), though that may vary depending on your system's graphics resources.<br /><br />Good hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey Solo'd it at 53 Rogue extremely easy to do just do what they tell you and use the pics they really help in locating the pool other then that no sweat Thanks for the help</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Flobster9</b></h3>Note for WoW Classic: The Dire Pool outside the Dire Maul instance is BUGGED and INVISIBLE.<br /><br />You can still fill the vial but the art asset for the pool is not currently showing in the world. <br /><br />At the far western (left hand path) of Eldreth Row is a dead end. If you move your character around the dead end wall you will feel a large invisible object. You can fill the vial while standing next to this object.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>boblanus</b></h3>If you can't find it, it might be bugged like it was for me. The fountain is either invisible or inside the wall/rock. You can still use the item at the correct spot to collect water. Hug the wall at the end of left corridor in Eldreth Row and use the flask.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>smtips</b></h3>Questie has this marked in the completely WRONG place if you use the addon for questing. Has it marked out in the ocean on the Forgotten Coast. It is def not there, follow what others said here to locate it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>drth308</b></h3>I did the quest today and the big water urn/fountain was there. Not sure if they fixed the bug or if it is only intermittently bugged, but at least on this occasion it was there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2377606</b></h3>the collect dire water great potion</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Woopah</b></h3>As of 2025, the Dire Pool is visible. <br /><br />Just enter by the main gate and turn on the left when you get the the intersection.<br /><br /><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ISnobSR" rel="nofollow">Dire pool screenshot</a></div>
