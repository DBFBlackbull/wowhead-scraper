This is actually one of the MOST useful transmutes. The only other one that comes close is Water>Air, but that takes an entire day before you can do it again. Transmute Elemental Fire on the other hand, can be used every 10 minutes, meaning that as long as you stock up on Hearts of Fire, and their cost is less than that of 3 Elemental Fires, you're essentially generating passive income. Combine this with herbalism and you'll be swimming in GFPPs, which are always going to be useful for raiding and even PvP.","creationdate":"2021-01-18T13:14:47-06:00","id":1442908,"rating":0,"commentid":24999,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"HordeRestoDruid","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":1,"id":27853,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"serbaut","body":"When firepots were in high demand this transmute was extremely useful.

For herb/alch people it's not worth the effort to build up your rep with this faction only to have this one lame recipe as a reward. As this faction seems to favor enchanters and blacksmith's, you might want to work with your guild to see where your rep mats can best be placed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>serbaut</b></h3>When firepots were in high demand this transmute was extremely useful. Probably not anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>21721</b></h3>My alt is nearly Friendly with Thoriums, and believe me this transmute will be very handy! Just look at the price of Elemental Fire, then Greater Fire Protection Potion's @ AH 30min's before most guilds on your server raid... <br /><br />Players, unless stupidly rich, aren't using the Major's really yet, particularly with most guilds still learning / wiping on Kara bosses :)<br /><br />Still useful, still high in demand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's a 10 minute cooldown. Try getting it first. Now I need a mule for the 1000 or so I'll have. Honestly 3 is a bit overkill for a heart of fire, but I'll never request a change :)<br /><br />What blizzard needs to do now is drop # of dreamfoil required on the other pots. Sure it's available in many zones but you still only get 1-3 and it's a lot of treading in one zone for 10 if you are lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>10 minutes cooldown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>10min cooldown CONFIRMED! :D<br /><br />great i bought 120 Heart's already :P<br /><br />Greetz<br />&nbsp; -------&gt; Dotty<br /><br />60 Dwarf Female Rogue @ Shadow Moon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yep 10 minute cooldown. Getting the rep was a #$%^&amp;, but it's worth while!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This transmute requires Friendly with the Thorium Brotherhood. You need to be a 300 level alchemist as well. If you'd like more information on getting Friendly with TB please click <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Thorium_Brotherhood" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br />The recipe is purchased at the NPC in the bar in Black Rock Depths. There is only <b>one</b> recipe per instance, so you may have to roll for it.<br /><br />Finally, this transmute uses up the philosopher's stone cooldown. However the cooldown is <b>10 minutes</b>, way under most other transmutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Nah - I'm a rogue... I can just stealth to the bar and get it on a solo run...<br /><br />*grins*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is only one place I've seen where you aggro while in stealth, that is after the long hallway where you come to the four guards. You can run through them then vanish. But I'm only a level 53 Rogue and maybe my stealth isn't the best. The 6 fire guards are easy just before the bar. I just sprint through them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hearts of Fire seem to be pretty rare for me; my undead rogue ended up buying all of the ones he needed for his Helm of Fire.&nbsp; I tried killing every fire elemental I ran across, and I found no Hearts, some Elemental Fire, and one Essence of Fire.&nbsp; Elemental Fire is much easier for me to find, although I usually don't find it at high levels unless I'm looking for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah the above poster experienced what I did, thats why I'm here. Guess now I understand why I can't transmute...sigh.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If more than one person needs it, just wait a while for it to respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where in BRD is the vendor?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He's in the bar area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just noticed that while all other Transmutes are grey at skill 300, this one is still red - so it's most likely the most efficient way to gain skillpoints as it requires only on Heart of Fire every 10 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did you notice, that you need to be allready at 300 to learn it?<br /><br />May be you can level in burning crusade with it, if it won't change. ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can anyone tell me how to get to the bar :) fastes way and how many you need. (lvl 60)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you can stealth you can go solo.&nbsp; If not, you're gonna need a group with a rogue and a priest.&nbsp; Allow 45 mins or so.<br /><br />Go thru the door on the left, then the gate on the right, then the next door on the left.&nbsp; Have someone open the lock so the door upstairs opens.&nbsp; *Since patch 1.10 rogues can pick this locking mechanism.<br /><br />Fight your way upstairs and around to the left.&nbsp; Pull the groups of four back to you and watch for a couple of patrols.&nbsp; When you get to General Angerforge on your left, go ahead and kill him, then proceed to your right into the Manufactory.&nbsp; Pull and kill as before, and you will come to a bridge with 6 Fire Elementals.&nbsp; The Bar (Grim Guzzler) is on the other side of the bridge.<br /><br />Have the priest put a bubble (shield) on the rogue.&nbsp; The rogue can <u>sprint</u> right down the middle of the Fireguards and they will all aggro on him.&nbsp; He should cross the bridge into the bar, bear to the right to the door at the corner...&nbsp; turn left in the upper part of the bar and cross to Lokhtos Darkbargainer in the little room past all the drinking patrons.&nbsp; Once the rogue gets to Lokhtos he should vanish, and all the Firelords will evade back to the bridge.<br /><br />The rest of the group should follow the rogue across the bridge and into the lower part of the bar.&nbsp; Peel off to the left wall in the lower bar and wait for the Firelords to return to the bridge.&nbsp; Now the rest of the group can head up to Lokhtos Darkbargainer.&nbsp; If you have rep with the Thorium Brotherhood, he has the recipes.<br /><br />The first time a rogue tries this, he will probably mess up on the vanish part and get killed.&nbsp; But then he will learn how for the next time.&nbsp; NO ONE should click on any MOB in the bar.&nbsp; If one bar patron aggros, they all will, and they will stay red until the instance is reset.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay here's the deal with this recipe, as near as I can tell (just got it yesterday).<br /><br />It looks like it DOES share your other transmute cooldowns, in a way, but it also has a 10 minute cooldown. For example, if you perform a different transmute (earth to life, undeath to water, etc) you WON'T be able to transmute Hearts of Fire until that cooldown has completed.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if there are no cooldowns pending, the Heart of Fire transmute has its own 10 minute cooldown, meaning that you can do the transmute back-to-back every 10 minutes for as long as you want. But once you perform one of your other transmutes, you have to wait 24 hours. Make sense?<br /><br />It looks like this is what's happening, from what I can tell.<br /><br />I was really bummed when i finally learned this recipe since one of my other CD's was ticking, and it said I had 10 hours left. But I just did my first heart of fire transmute, and it said 9 minutes 59 seconds. woot!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the cooldown for this xmute will be raised to 15 min in 2.1</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>User on thottbot say it's on 2 days cd now :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does this transmute have a cool down?<br /><br />Edit: nevermind<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jan 5 14:36:11 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>does the cd get bigger after 1.10 or still 10min</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Money makers, sell ur elemental fire fast. Its pretty easy to become friendly with TBH and all alchemist will do. Elemental Fire price will drop to 70-80% or likely</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Listed cooldown is still 600 seconds, or if you prefer, 10 minutes</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this one is on 10min cooldown :D<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jan 4 13:14:41 2006</div>
