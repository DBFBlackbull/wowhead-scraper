Druids ARE CASTERS. Take a look at our Epic Armour sets and even the wildheart set. What is the highest stat bonus over the entire set, in all of them? INTELLECT followed closely by Stamina and Spirit. Why don't u try playing a Resto or Balance specced Druid if u don't think we need to Crit on spells either. We get on the balance line talents that allow our Crit offence spell to do double damage instead of 150%. We get talents that on crit we get 1sec cast time reduced on Regrowth\\Healing Touch and in Restoration line u get talents that increase ur Regrowth Crit damage by up to 50% (depends on the number of talent points used). Not only that but cloth invariably gives higher status increases than Leather armour to counteract the lesser Armour class, So we need weapons with Awesome Stats bonuses to try and catch up on the health\\mana pool difference. It's not only that but i have yet to see an Epic set for a feral Druid. the best a feral druid can do ATM is to get the shadowcraft set.

I could use that thing to IMPALE somebody on an ambush!\n\nAlright, alright, I'm totally kidding, put the \"ZOMG!\" beating stick away.\n\nNow on to seriousness.&nbsp; This weapon is BLATANTLY made for a Mage if you look at the statistics.&nbsp; Mages rely largely on Intellect bonuses for their mana pool, their spell damage, their critical chance, and generally all other attributes that involve the amount of damage their spells do.&nbsp; As a Mage, your role is essentially that of a howitzer in a bathrobe.&nbsp; Mages do not function in any other real role aside from the long-range pain they deal out.&nbsp; Saying that this is not true is like saying that a Priest does not heal (Even Shadow-specialized Priests are primary healers when they step into a group.)&nbsp; Therefore, +31 Intellect is absolutely freaking massive in the hands of a Mage, particularly if a high level Intellect enchantment is then placed onto that to increase the bonus further.&nbsp; Combined with appropriate clothing (Like the Arcanist Regalia for the sake of argument) and enchanting, high end Mages just become more, and more, and more deadly.&nbsp; Since this is their only method of survival, it should take priority over every other class for this weapon.&nbsp; Additionally, this should be a no-brainer.&nbsp; Before you all scream me out, I will explain why for each appropriate class:\n\nWarlocks - I feel for you guys, I really do.&nbsp; There needs to be more Warlock equipment in this game.&nbsp; I believe you Warlocks should have a good deal of priority when trying to recieve this thing as well.&nbsp; The Stamina boost, the +crit (Destruction spec), and the Damage\/Heal are all of great use to you.&nbsp; Intellect also is a great thing.&nbsp; However, here's something to chew on: \n\nWarlocks tend to first have a good selection of daggers or swords\/offhand items to hunt for.&nbsp; Granted, Mages hunt for these too, which justifies your wanting this staff.&nbsp; Second, more important reason - Mages are generally flying by the seat of their pants.&nbsp; When a Mage runs out of mana, ESPECIALLY one-on-one in PvP or PvE, it dies, plain and simple.&nbsp; Warlocks, however, get the option of one of four faithful little demons that can be pretty much summoned at random.&nbsp; If you run out of mana, you've got a couple options as a Warlock.&nbsp; Still a bad situation, but you've got more options than a Mage does - particularly one that isn't specced for Evocation.&nbsp; Third, and most important reason a Warlock should be a team player and give this to a Mage who needs it?&nbsp; Warlocks need as much Stamina as they do Intellect.&nbsp; Your hit points are a secondary mana pool for quite a few abilities.&nbsp; Hellfire doesn't reach it's full potential unless you've got plenty of health to survive the damage you take.&nbsp; Life Tap will allow you to refill your mana if you have plenty of health to burn.&nbsp; All in all, yes, a Warlock can most definately rock with this staff, but if a Mage really needs it and is being a nice guy and a good team player, pass on the bid, and transfer your good deed coin to your right pocket for the day.&nbsp; If, however, Mages are not interested?&nbsp; Jump on this thing like mad.\n\nDruids - Now, I'm not overly experienced with Druids, but from what I know of them, you can sort of do a little of everything.&nbsp; You deal out spell damage (kinda), which this staff would be good for.&nbsp; However, you can also turn into a bear and beat the snot out of someone, or turn into a ninja-kitty and rip somebody to shreds.&nbsp; Additionally, Druids are the other class that can be a Primary Healer - which is what you'll likely be doing quite a bit of inside a 40 man raid.&nbsp; You have options in your playing style.&nbsp; As such, you've got an advantage that most other casting classes don't get - When you run low on mana you can cast a spell and kick ass in melee.&nbsp; Because of this, you should let the dude in the bathrobe who lives and dies on spellcasting get the first dibs on this.&nbsp; Again, however, if you can do so without swiping a good piece of loot from your friends, you can certainly use this if you're Balance or Restoration specified.&nbsp; If you're Feral, this isn't really that great for you.\n\nPriest - The ultimate Priest staff, which people can't really try to contest you for, is Benediction\/Anathema.&nbsp; The thing is amazing.&nbsp; It is the be-all-end-all for pretty much every Priest style you can think up, as far as I have seen.&nbsp; It is your Perdition's Blade.&nbsp; The Staff of Dominance is just about the same thing for Mages.&nbsp; Yes, Benediction\/Anathema is incredibly hard to make, but the payoff is so worth it.&nbsp; And once you have it (which isn't eons away if you are regularly running Molten Core) this staff suddenly isn't that great for you.&nbsp; An Epic weapon that many Mages will tear their right arms off for will become vendor food or disenchanting ammo.&nbsp; Bit of a shame, isn't it?&nbsp; Let the Mages that need this get it before you do, they'll be using it for a very, very long time, whereas you'll be probably using it for an interrum until you get that Benediction\/Anathema quest done.\n\nShaman - The ONLY kind of Shaman that this thing would truly interest is a heavily Elemental specced Shaman, *maybe* a Restoration specced one.&nbsp; This is a bit low on the totem pole, so to speak, for a class that can wear Mail and, depending on talents, swing around an Arcanite Reaper with the best of them.&nbsp; Even Elemental Shamans are not purely spellcasters - they get in and dish it out melee from time to time too.&nbsp; ONLY take this if other spellcasting classes are disinterested, even outbidding a Warlock for this thing isn't cool, let alone a Mage.&nbsp; If you're full Elemental, wait to see if any of the bathrobe-wearers need it first, if not, fight it out with the Druids and other Shamans to see if you can snag it.&nbsp; If you are Restoration, same thing.&nbsp; If you're Enhancement, don't even bother with this thing, it's not gonna help you very much compared to a good axe or mace.\n\nEvery other class, don't even look at it.\n\nThe moral of the story is - this thing is perfectly suited to a Mage statistically, please consider that before screaming \"OMGLEWT!\" and going crazy over it.","date":"2006-01-24T09:52:02-06:00","rating":24,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I understand you made this post 6 months ago- so this reply is more for ppl who may stop to read this in the future.\n\nMy main is a druid (Resto spec) so naturally, I'm here to defend:\n\nYou mentioned that a druid ina&nbsp;

You've got yourself a balance druid, and they want the staff. They're a veteran player that's been with you for ages and you know they want more damage gear. But because of whatever dumbass priority system you use, the staff goes to a mage that's been in the guild for three weeks and has 1\/4 the DKP of the balance druid. So basically you just told the druid \"Sorry, but we've decided that your 7 months of dedicated play is woth less than the mage just being a mage\" How is that supposed to make the druid feel?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6987</b></h3>This is a caster staff, more than anything.<br /><br />Depending on how open, or closed minded, your guild is, most guilds will let all casters roll on this item in mc. I have one on my 60 priest, and it served me well until my turn at an eye of divinity dropped. It was certainly better than my little blue staff from scarlet monastary *laugh*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8063</b></h3>For druids just starting MC and deciding and what weapon is better, Staff of Dominance or Finkles Lava Dredger. SOD is the way to go. the 40 damage/healing helps tremendously on your rejuvenation and regrowth ticks, along with the 1% crit and added with 37 intellect and 14 spirit. You can enchant this staff with either +55 healing or +22 intellect, whatever your playstyle fits for you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8676</b></h3>Since the recent talent revamping this is a great pickup for a mage. Before this patch I would have said take the mageblade since the +dmg is much greater and can be stacked with a nice offhand. This can still be done but with the new arcane talent that increases your spell damage by 25% of your intellect this should be a great pickup if you spec that way. The 37 INT on it is a really nice boost to help that talent out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This staff is amazing for ANY class that has spells. Simple as that. All casters would kill for this. Doesn't matter who it's better for, all would roll. So just stop right now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's been my experience that +magic dmg and +arcane dmg adds to moonfire, but only about 1/3 goes to the initial dmg and the other 2/3 gets distributed over the bleed.<br />If you spam wrath though, 40 magic dmg would add a lot to your dps and efficiency, and its almost as much dps as spamming moonfire, more if you have a lot of nature and magic dmg gear.<br />This staff is fantastic, I think anyone who can cast spells should roll on it, though if a paladin ever rolled against me I'd kill him on the spot, since I'm horde.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This ends here, this ends now...<br /><br />In no specific order:<br />Priest<br />Mage<br />Warlock<br />Druid<br /><br />AKA: Any caster can use that! Along with Druids, who we can argue as to their title another time. But yes, casters and Druids. None has any priority over the other, good for all, shut up now, thank you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Almost everyone on this thread (and almost anywhere else on Thottbot too) seems to think that Druids don't use these stats as much as other casters. Druids ARE CASTERS. Take a look at our Epic Armour sets and even the wildheart set. What is the highest stat bonus over the entire set, in all of them? INTELLECT followed closely by Stamina and Spirit. Why don't u try playing a Resto or Balance specced Druid if u don't think we need to Crit on spells either. We get on the balance line talents that allow our Crit offence spell to do double damage instead of 150%. We get talents that on crit we get 1sec cast time reduced on Regrowth\Healing Touch and in Restoration line u get talents that increase ur Regrowth Crit damage by up to 50% (depends on the number of talent points used). Not only that but cloth invariably gives higher status increases than Leather armour to counteract the lesser Armour class, So we need weapons with Awesome Stats bonuses to try and catch up on the health\mana pool difference. It's not only that but i have yet to see an Epic set for a feral Druid. the best a feral druid can do ATM is to get the shadowcraft set. Anyone who says that a druid should give up a chance on rolling for this when there are mages who get higher stat bonuses from their blue equipment sets than a Druid does from their epic set is a total IDIOT!<br />I would happily pass on this if someone desperately needed it and i already had a very nice staff already like the Glowing Brightwood Staff or something just as nice, but otherwise shut up about druids not needing crits on spells and not being casters. Cause being able to crit a spell for 1000 health with the chance of a stun makes us just that CASTERS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finkles Lava vs. Quel �Dorai Channeling Rod for Druids:<br /><br />+17 Sta -&gt; Nice<br />+6 Int -&gt; Lame<br />-8 Spirit-&gt; Bad<br />+1 Mana per 5 Sec. -&gt; Lame<br />+15 Fireresist-&gt; Nice<br />+27,5 DPS-&gt; Not needed<br /><br />Personally i would not want this for my Druid. <br />Getting Quel Dorai is easy to get with 2-4 People.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Come on you idiots, it's clearly a Rogue staff.&nbsp; I could use that thing to IMPALE somebody on an ambush!<br /><br />Alright, alright, I'm totally kidding, put the &quot;ZOMG!&quot; beating stick away.<br /><br />Now on to seriousness.&nbsp; This weapon is BLATANTLY made for a Mage if you look at the statistics.&nbsp; Mages rely largely on Intellect bonuses for their mana pool, their spell damage, their critical chance, and generally all other attributes that involve the amount of damage their spells do.&nbsp; As a Mage, your role is essentially that of a howitzer in a bathrobe.&nbsp; Mages do not function in any other real role aside from the long-range pain they deal out.&nbsp; Saying that this is not true is like saying that a Priest does not heal (Even Shadow-specialized Priests are primary healers when they step into a group.)&nbsp; Therefore, +31 Intellect is absolutely freaking massive in the hands of a Mage, particularly if a high level Intellect enchantment is then placed onto that to increase the bonus further.&nbsp; Combined with appropriate clothing (Like the Arcanist Regalia for the sake of argument) and enchanting, high end Mages just become more, and more, and more deadly.&nbsp; Since this is their only method of survival, it should take priority over every other class for this weapon.&nbsp; Additionally, this should be a no-brainer.&nbsp; Before you all scream me out, I will explain why for each appropriate class:<br /><br />Warlocks - I feel for you guys, I really do.&nbsp; There needs to be more Warlock equipment in this game.&nbsp; I believe you Warlocks should have a good deal of priority when trying to recieve this thing as well.&nbsp; The Stamina boost, the +crit (Destruction spec), and the Damage/Heal are all of great use to you.&nbsp; Intellect also is a great thing.&nbsp; However, here's something to chew on: <br /><br />Warlocks tend to first have a good selection of daggers or swords/offhand items to hunt for.&nbsp; Granted, Mages hunt for these too, which justifies your wanting this staff.&nbsp; Second, more important reason - Mages are generally flying by the seat of their pants.&nbsp; When a Mage runs out of mana, ESPECIALLY one-on-one in PvP or PvE, it dies, plain and simple.&nbsp; Warlocks, however, get the option of one of four faithful little demons that can be pretty much summoned at random.&nbsp; If you run out of mana, you've got a couple options as a Warlock.&nbsp; Still a bad situation, but you've got more options than a Mage does - particularly one that isn't specced for Evocation.&nbsp; Third, and most important reason a Warlock should be a team player and give this to a Mage who needs it?&nbsp; Warlocks need as much Stamina as they do Intellect.&nbsp; Your hit points are a secondary mana pool for quite a few abilities.&nbsp; Hellfire doesn't reach it's full potential unless you've got plenty of health to survive the damage you take.&nbsp; Life Tap will allow you to refill your mana if you have plenty of health to burn.&nbsp; All in all, yes, a Warlock can most definately rock with this staff, but if a Mage really needs it and is being a nice guy and a good team player, pass on the bid, and transfer your good deed coin to your right pocket for the day.&nbsp; If, however, Mages are not interested?&nbsp; Jump on this thing like mad.<br /><br />Druids - Now, I'm not overly experienced with Druids, but from what I know of them, you can sort of do a little of everything.&nbsp; You deal out spell damage (kinda), which this staff would be good for.&nbsp; However, you can also turn into a bear and beat the snot out of someone, or turn into a ninja-kitty and rip somebody to shreds.&nbsp; Additionally, Druids are the other class that can be a Primary Healer - which is what you'll likely be doing quite a bit of inside a 40 man raid.&nbsp; You have options in your playing style.&nbsp; As such, you've got an advantage that most other casting classes don't get - When you run low on mana you can cast a spell and kick ass in melee.&nbsp; Because of this, you should let the dude in the bathrobe who lives and dies on spellcasting get the first dibs on this.&nbsp; Again, however, if you can do so without swiping a good piece of loot from your friends, you can certainly use this if you're Balance or Restoration specified.&nbsp; If you're Feral, this isn't really that great for you.<br /><br />Priest - The ultimate Priest staff, which people can't really try to contest you for, is Benediction/Anathema.&nbsp; The thing is amazing.&nbsp; It is the be-all-end-all for pretty much every Priest style you can think up, as far as I have seen.&nbsp; It is your Perdition's Blade.&nbsp; The Staff of Dominance is just about the same thing for Mages.&nbsp; Yes, Benediction/Anathema is incredibly hard to make, but the payoff is so worth it.&nbsp; And once you have it (which isn't eons away if you are regularly running Molten Core) this staff suddenly isn't that great for you.&nbsp; An Epic weapon that many Mages will tear their right arms off for will become vendor food or disenchanting ammo.&nbsp; Bit of a shame, isn't it?&nbsp; Let the Mages that need this get it before you do, they'll be using it for a very, very long time, whereas you'll be probably using it for an interrum until you get that Benediction/Anathema quest done.<br /><br />Shaman - The ONLY kind of Shaman that this thing would truly interest is a heavily Elemental specced Shaman, *maybe* a Restoration specced one.&nbsp; This is a bit low on the totem pole, so to speak, for a class that can wear Mail and, depending on talents, swing around an Arcanite Reaper with the best of them.&nbsp; Even Elemental Shamans are not purely spellcasters - they get in and dish it out melee from time to time too.&nbsp; ONLY take this if other spellcasting classes are disinterested, even outbidding a Warlock for this thing isn't cool, let alone a Mage.&nbsp; If you're full Elemental, wait to see if any of the bathrobe-wearers need it first, if not, fight it out with the Druids and other Shamans to see if you can snag it.&nbsp; If you are Restoration, same thing.&nbsp; If you're Enhancement, don't even bother with this thing, it's not gonna help you very much compared to a good axe or mace.<br /><br />Every other class, don't even look at it.<br /><br />The moral of the story is - this thing is perfectly suited to a Mage statistically, please consider that before screaming &quot;OMGLEWT!&quot; and going crazy over it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why is it that every time I try to read a thread on a weapon to find some useful information, it's 90% people arguing and whining about which class should use it? It's almost impossible to find actual info on the weapon when most of the posts are &quot;ZOMG that's totally for &lt;blank&gt; class and anyone else who disagrees is idiot n00bz!&quot; intermixed with a few people who sound like calculus professors, giving indepth lectures on each statistic-altering percentage and how all these stats affect each class, coming up with a conclusion as to who the most logical choice is. <br /><br />I'm sure Blizzard sometimes has certain classes in mind when they create an item, but unless it's a class-specific item that nobody else can equip, I say roll/bid on it if you can equip it and its better than what you currently have. If you get it, great. If you don't, don't whine. It's a <b>game</b>, and most people aren't going to pull out their graphing calculators in the middle of a dungeon to figure out who should get each item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LOl <br /><br />Guys for a balance drood it is interesting and it is not lowerinh his heals or somethin it's increasing it! <br />If gives 37 int if u put + 22 int ench it's perfect. If u have cenarion set with good ench with it your meme regeneration will stay important as well. I always let mage in front of me if he reallly needs it that is a fact. But to say that druids should go get rank 14 to get spell dmg and all crap just lol. With this staff and cenarion set and more if u are balance / resto it really powns. And trust me this staff boosts your druids they will heal better and will have a loth of mana! And if a drood is spamming balance spells in a mc raid excuse me but he isn't doin his job. So yes it's priority to mages but the staff goes well to druids too. Know a loth of good druid with it and can tell u that they only tell me good stuff about it. <br />So don't be lame by tellin that for druids it is not for druids. And dunno how in your guilds works but in my guild if a person who bids has the hihgest dkp amount he ll get it and it works perfectly fine ppl even inforced their solidarity by lettin some items and passing on them. <br />It's just a game at the end and all have the chance to recieve what they desire. <br /><br />Thanks for reading this <br /><br />/cheers <br />/gl</div>

Im a mage btw and anyone saying that this is staff should go to 1 specific class and then to other classes should go kill some plainstriders in the barrens. This staff is good for shamans, mages, locks, dr00ds and priests (ok ok and hunters, happy now? :P).

Both IMO (Especially the dredger) would be more useful to shamans than druids. Druids dont have a quest for a weapon and dont have a staple weapon, and that stats are 100% useful to druids. Plus mages and warlocks do have the mageblade</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This staff drops so much on my server its not even funny. Every mage and lock has this staff already if not better. To be honest with urself, mages and locks get priority on this weapon for a simple fact. WE CANT USE +HEALING STATS. WoW intended for + healing stats to be way more then + damage and healing stats. druids/shami get + healing maces, priest get benni. Mages and locks can put the +dmg to more use and also its going to be better for the raid. If a druid is using +dmg for Pve in an endgame instance, u should leave the raid cause you are going to wipe. <br />This staff could be put to use by all classes in pvp simply said, but druids and priest should only get it after all mages/locks get it cause ur probably going to go back to MC to finish off ur tear 1 sets and to pick up some odds and ends like ur ter 2 pants, rings and trinkets. So untill all mages and locks get it, don't be gready and don't hurt ur raid!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hey i was just wondering about peoples input on this subject?<br /><br />To help stop all the arguements over who deserves priority over gear etc why didnt Blizzard do the same thing for casters like mages and locks as they did for healer's and make +spell dmg only gear? I mean mages and locks are obviously not going to roll on aurastone cause its only +healing but everything mages and locks want and use and both healing and dmg on it wich in turn makes them have to roll against 3 or 4 other classes. Does that seem fair? plz no flaming just a simple question haha.</div>

I have a lvl 60 druid and I think this staff is really quite perfect for my character. I'm restoration-specced with a little feral for pvp so the int is great for healing, as is the +40 heal/spell dmg, and the stam never hurt anybody either! The crit chance helps in healing AND dmg. An uber weapon for a druid. If you ask me, the fact that it specifies healing makes it best for priest or druid, with secondary to mages and locks. But since priests have class-specific epic weapons (Benediction) I think this one is well-suited and deserved for druids.<br /><br />Server: Shadow Moon</div>

So a staff drops you are a oomkin druid ofc bid. Although In my guild warlocks have prio on this, meaning if a warlock wants it it will goto a warlock nomather what the bid is. Same with the staff from ZG on panther boss has druid prio. But thats because we are working together as a team and think for our progress when raiding, but ofc if a druid want this for pvp reasons or whatever and no warlock wants it he would have the same right as anyone else to bid. Same with the zg staff, if no druid want it everyone is free to bid.<br /><br />Raid progress is for us more important than 200 extra damage in pvp. But dont flame people for wanting this when they are druids, this is a really good staff for a druid aswell.<br />37 int, and 40 HEALING / damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I won this over a druid last night. Not the best +damage weapon for a mage in Molten Core, but after realizing that half the mage reel in our guild and most of the paladins too are after Mageblade, I decided I'd rather replace my blue staffs (Trindlehaven with +22int and Rod of the Ogre Magi) now than wait out my turn for three months, when Staff of Shadow Flame might be a possibility for our guild. :) Plus, you don't have to spend even more time/loot reel position hunting for a worthwhile offhand for mageblade. Gathering the materials for +30 spell power enchant, and then I can't wait to try it out in AV!<br /><br /><a href="http://offcentre.net/shewows/screens/dominance.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://offcentre.net/shewows/screens/dominance.jpg</a><br />how it looks with my Molten Core gearset.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Dec 30 17:31:01 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, every Healer and Damage Dealer has need on this one. I am a healing specialized Shaman. I will geht this staff once it drops. Priests have Benediction, Druids, have the staff from the green dragons and/or Arlokhs Will. So I will geht this next time. It has good Stats for every caster.. critical strike chances and +spell damage and healing. The only thing that tops the SoD is the Shadowflame Staff</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, this of course a good ubber staff, but actually the map of that item have changed since 1.09 I think. Nowadays it looks like: <br /><br />Two dragons faced one each other with a huge gem in centre of the staff with a long staff ended by a gold spine. The rest can you see on this picture: <br /><br /></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What is wrong with you people? If someone wants an item and they're higher in whatever system you use why not just let them have it? Don't give me this crap about &quot;contribution to the raid blah blah blah&quot; Look at it this way. You've got yourself a balance druid, and they want the staff. They're a veteran player that's been with you for ages and you know they want more damage gear. But because of whatever dumbass priority system you use, the staff goes to a mage that's been in the guild for three weeks and has 1/4 the DKP of the balance druid. So basically you just told the druid &quot;Sorry, but we've decided that your 7 months of dedicated play is woth less than the mage just being a mage&quot; How is that supposed to make the druid feel? Probably kinda crappy? The result? Over time he stops having an interest in the game and eventually quits. So here's a little math for you number people.<br /><br />1 &quot;wasted&quot; epic staff &lt; 8 Cenarion + rings/trinkets/neck/cape<br /><br />Treat your people well and they'll stay around. No one in their right mind is going to argue that they should get something just because its more suited to their class over someone that's worked three times as hard for it. Druids, shadow priests, retribution paladins, etc. Don't you think they get enough BS as it is? <br /><br />I mean seriously, I've seen guilds lose two or three people over controversy over one drop. That's 1 epic not &quot;wasted&quot; costing up to 50 epics to the guild. Any system that assigns loot on a basis other than merit is just ridiculous. I mean, its pretty much like racism. &quot;Rogues are innately more important than druids, so they get everything first, you can have the scraps.&quot; I see druids, priests, and pallies (and I'm sure its the same with shaman) getting treated like they're second priority players for ages and its just wrong. <br /><br />~A feral druid that has the Staff of Dominance and gets along quite well with his guild's mages and rogues. <br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 12th 2006 at 11:55am EDT by JarynFrostwing</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The main reason to go for the staff is that it ONE cost of points. whereas the sword + book = TWO sets of points. and its only a little better... <br /><br />best thing if you ask me:<br /><br />Azuresong + spell power enchant + the Epic books from Altrec Vally = over 100 extra dmg on evey spell of your chosen field</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sure the staff is useable by priests and druids. If a priest or druid wanted it in our raid, we wouldn't stop them. However it certainly isn't the best thing for their class.<br /><br />People only see things in one direction. Look at it from a mage's perspective. You fail to realize that mages and warlocks ***DO NOT HAVE*** the luxury of rolling on things like Benediction or Finkle's, whereas druids and priests do. Not that a mage/warlock should take those, I know, but the point is you have MORE CHOICES than we do. Sure you CAN use this staff, but that doesn't mean you should be a greedy, lazy ass and take it from someone that doesn't have a weapon quest, or can only roll on limited items.<br /><br />If you're too damned lethargic to do your Benediction quest (I don't know why, as it's NOT that bad), then don't deprive a mage or warlock of soomething like this. Bene/Ana is FAR better for a priest, so much so that taking a SoD over it is completely stupid.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jan 30 18:06:53 2006</div>
