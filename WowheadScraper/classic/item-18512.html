Just remember you need to take at least one other person with you to form a raid to be able to enter the instance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>when i first started to farm these, i got like 3 within 15 minutes of each other. Then for the next hour and a half, i found another two. so drop isn't that bad, and it sells for like 15g each on my server. I put my first 3 up for 11g each and they were all bought out within the hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There are about 3 or 4 carrion grubs between the EPL flight point and Tyr's Hand. Whenever I go to Tyr's Hand to farm, I just hit the ones I see along the way. Doing this, I've picked up about 10 larval acids in one week effortlessly and sell them for about 15g each on the AH on my server. The only thing that sucks about it is that occasionally the grubs will hit you with a disease that takes away 50 attack power for half an hour. That kind of blows if you're heading into Tyr's Hand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well so far I like this little beast ;) The acid dropped on second kill, got 13 g for it in AH, sold straight away... Could it be that the devorous ones are better dropping?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was farming and got about 4 in an hour, So rate is not bad</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Drop rate is around 6-8% around the scars... Grubs FTW. 4 in an hour... around that</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I get about 5 per hour. Use a /target Carrion to find the larvas faster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This thread had me worried... really worried...<br /><br />So i went farming in EPL... a bit discouraged..<br /><br />Killed 17 grubs in total and got my 8 Larval acid for the Hide of the Wild.<br /><br />Yea Me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Silicate Feeders are the way to go here.&nbsp; If your guild is working on AQ 20 and have cleared as far as Buru the Gorger, you can get these pretty easily, but you can't have killed Ayamiss the Hunter, or they won't respawn.<br /><br />We had a partial run one night, only 15 of us showed up, so we cleared through the first 4 bosses (Kurinnaxx, Rajaxx, Moam, and Buru) and called it a night.&nbsp; I continued on up the hill towards Ayamiss and proceeded to pull around 15 Feeders (they don't link with the Collector/Tail Lasher packs).&nbsp; I then stripped and committed suicide, putting me back at the front of the instance.&nbsp; From here I ran to Moam's side (he was dead), up the stairs and cut across Ossirian's room to the stairs on the other side.&nbsp; From here I was able to pull around 10 more from Ayamiss' room.<br /><br />A rogue, druid, or hunter could farm these pretty easily under the above circumstances, and if you clear as far as Ayamiss but can't get her down, any class could do this.&nbsp; There's a 30 minute soft reset on the zone (everyone out of the pool for 30 minutes), then come back in and do it again.&nbsp; I went in around 6 times over the next few days and pulled about 40 Larval Acid, 10 Idols, about 60 coins, 5 greens and a blue for 6 hours of work.&nbsp; I'd suspect the drop table on them to be adjusted next patch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Today on Medivh US.&nbsp; I'm a mage.&nbsp; <br /><br />The longest part was of course finding the damn mobs, even with a target macro.&nbsp; Hunters with tracking probably have a bit of a better time at it.<br /><br />Drop rate wasn't so horrible from what I saw, but again, there's no one area with a good concentration of the mobs, so you need to keep constantly running around looking for more of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive farmed them for 1 hour exactly now, and I've recieved 6 Larval Acids :), Farming as a warrior ftw</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so.<br /><br />I killed 4 mobs and I got 2 larval acids..<br /><br />Each sold for 16 g minimum..<br /><br />Today I went to Stratholme.<br /><br />Killed one mob and it dropped larval acid..<br /><br />so I am lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you are specifically after these then you just run all over with your mount.&nbsp; WHY? because you can out run the aggressive mobs on your mount and you can cover alot more ground in less time.&nbsp; You see one and you dissmount and kill it.&nbsp; Or you can go up the Thondroril River and by the cave you can pick up a quest that wants you to kill all the creatures around there including a drop off the carrion worms.<br /><br />You should not &amp;*!@# to much about the drop rate because for one it is a valuable item for a Epic or a valuable item to sell on the AH for 8-15g&nbsp; Try /roll over an over and over again and see how many times you roll a number you randomly pick yourself, not that easy to do.<br /><br />The drop rate is pretty much .7 per hour farming with a mount.&nbsp; But if you want to encrease your odds of getting them then long on in the wee wee late hours of the game because there are simply less people playing and more mobs to kill so the drop rate increases to .9 per hour of farming with a mount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This should be an end all, be all to farming these.&nbsp; Let me say as a preliminary, however, that you have to have access to AQ20, and your group has to be able to clear preferably the whole instance other than Ayamiss.&nbsp; So needless to say, if you are attempting to go into AQ40, this is a very helpful way to farm this terrible material.<br /><br /><b>What you need:</b><br />1x almost cleared AQ20 instance (only boss you need alive is Ayamiss)<br />1x Frost Mage, Hunter, or other ranged attacker able to slow mobs.<br /><br /><b>How to farm:</b><br />The first thing you need is a raid, since this can be done solo, all you need is a buddy to accept a group invite, and then convert to raid.<br /><br />Now that you can zone in, do so, and strip off all your gear (to save money in case you mess up the trip to the farming spot).<br /><br />Move in and follow the instance until you get to the split to go to Moam's or Buru's areas.&nbsp; Go to Buru's, and be careful of the Flesh Hunter that roams around.&nbsp; Continue to run straight, and then eventually fall off the side of the cliff onto the big 'pipe' at the end.&nbsp; Jump off the end of the pipe into the deep water where Buru used to be.<br /><br />Go to the far end of the water and mount up again.&nbsp; Watch for the other big Flesh Hunter that paths up and down, and all over the place.<br /><br />Move up the ramp to the top, going towards Ayamiss' lair.&nbsp; The connecting area between Buru and Ayamiss has a TON of the Silicate Feeders, which have the best drop rate on larval acid that I have seen.<br /><br />Go into the connecting 'path' but <b>STAY TO THE LEFT!</b>&nbsp; Once you are safely in the path to Ayamiss, on the left, you can requip your gear and get ready to kill.&nbsp; Pull the Silicate Feeders one at a time and kill them relatively close to your camp, but watch out for their poison cloud when they die.&nbsp; Don't worry about aggroing the hostile bugs, because they will not aggro to you when you pull a feeder, unless you get&nbsp; really close to them and body pull.&nbsp; Continue to pull them until you see none in the immediate area.<br /><br />Now, follow the wall that is behind you further into the 'path'.&nbsp; You should run into a bunch of honeycomb looking things.&nbsp; Hug the wall still, and get on the large bone type structure.&nbsp; Follow that <b>UP</b> along the wall until you get to the top.&nbsp; If you look away from the wall you should see another bone structure that makes a nice bridge for you.&nbsp; Jump down onto this 'bridge' and run across.&nbsp; Fall down on the far end and go into the side room with a bunch more feeders to kill.&nbsp; Proceed to destroy the feeders here.<br /><br />While still in the side room area, you can pull more feeders from the main 'path' back into your killing zone.&nbsp; Once you run out of feeders, strip naked, and die.<br /><br />Go back into the instance and this time head to Ossirian's room (from Moam's side).&nbsp; Go down the stairs towards Ayamiss and pull more feeders to kill.&nbsp; Continue to play cat and mouse in this area avoiding the bug packs until you are satisfied.<br /><br />Zone out.&nbsp; Wait <b>one hour</b> before zoning back in and the feeders should be respawned.&nbsp; Rinse, Repeat.<br /><br />Loot:<br />Many Scarabs (on AH can go for like 3g each or more on my server)<br />Couple Idols(vary from 20-50G each)<br />Many Larval Acids(8-10G each)<br />Chance at <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52971">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52971</a><br />Chance at high level epics (I found an Eye of Flame).<br /><br />This should make you good money, many scarabs and idols, and most of all good NR gear for AQ40 and Naxx.<br /><br />-Good Luck Farmers!<br />-Malakhai, 60 Gnome Mage (Frost), Omicron<br />-Staghelm Server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm not sure if its just blind luck or not, but for me it seems these are very much like the Stonescale Eel situation in that they drop in the early hours alot more frequently than in the daytime.<br /><br />For example;<br /><br />3-6pm - EPL Carrion Devourers... 1-2 an hour<br /><br />3-6am - EPL Carrion Devourers... 6 an hour<br /><br />I admit I haven't tested as much to be completely sure (only 2 or 3 times) but if you're bored early mornings it may be worth thinking about. :)</div>
