You're gonna have to swim there. When you reach dry land there will be lots of elite turtles. Avoid these if you can and continue on. You're almost there when you pass a downed gnome plane on the beach. Once you reach the mast sticking out of the sand, stand behind it facing the beach. Click on it and run backwards fast. 5 pirates will appear at the beach, run to the mast, and run halfway back and stand there.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah I did lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did the quest five times so far. First time I got 2 14 slot bags (yay). The other times a bunch of greens, which my enchanter isn't skilled enough to disenchant, so onto the auction house they go. <br /><br />There's more than one place to finish the quest by the way. Both are on the same island. The first spot you encounter is where I did it the first time, and the second time (with 4 maps) I went to the other one (which is around the south-most corner). The first spot was clear of turtles when I got there (but that could also be due to a Horde lvl 60 lock who was farming there), the second I had to clear.<br /><br />The second spot was easier, pirate-wise though. They immediately split up and run away a bit from the landmark. If you want to do this quest more than once, don't loot the pirates all in one batch.<br /><br />What you can do is you kill them, loot a key, finish the quest, take the quest again, loot another pirate, etc. Wash, rinse, repeat. Worked like a charm for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey folks,<br /><br />Noticed the drop rate on the Middle Map Fragment was pretty slim a while ago. Did they change that? I am now flooded with Middles and rarely get Upper Fragments.<br /><br />btw, did get a blue from a chest (Writ's Third Leg).<br /><br />Ciao,<br />Scalptaker, Uther</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I purchased the map off the AH for 10 silver.&nbsp; I then picked up all three fragements while killing pirates.&nbsp; Went down to the horn, clicked on mast, backed away before the treasure hunters spawned (good strategy, that), picked off a single treasure hunter and he dropped the key.&nbsp; Opened chest, got treasure.&nbsp; Backup again and put the fragments together to start the quest again.&nbsp; Figured I had best kill off the remaining treasure hunters before starting the quest again, so I killed off another pair and found a new key.&nbsp; The chest had respawned and I got a second treasure chest.&nbsp; <br /><br />Point is, if you're doing this multiple times, trigger the quest between kills.&nbsp; You don't have to spawn new treasure hunters each time to get a new key.<br /><br />FYI 47 Shadow Priest and the quest was a cake walk.&nbsp; Also not sure if this is a change or not, but the turtles in the area were NOT elite.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone in this thread is complaining about &quot;where is the gold,&quot; &quot;all I got was some crappy booze.&quot;<br /><br />Cuervo Gold is a brand of Tequila sold in RL.&nbsp; Cuergo Gold is a reference to that brand of tequila.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Parrot skeleton :()<br /><br />i got a :<br />Journeyman's backpack<br />champion's greaves of power <br />A wooden leg<br />A head rag<br />and of course:<br />Cuergo's Gold</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The turtles aren't elite, but they are aggressive.&nbsp; I did this at lvl 44 so I probably aggroed more pirates than somebody at a higher level.&nbsp; Just back away from the mast as fast as you can after you click on it. One of the pirates will drop the key.&nbsp; Got a green item and the Traveller's Backpack.&nbsp; Not a bad quest but a long swim.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got:<br />22,12s<br />Umbral Wand of the Whale<br />Myrmidons Bracers<br />Hoop Earing<br />2 x Parrot Skels</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>58,87</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I finally found it, and what did i get for that:<br /><br />10 S<br />Star Ruby (green)<br />Citrine (green)<br />A wooden leg (grey)<br />Cuergo's gold (alcohol)<br /><br />Cheer..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This starts the Cuergo's Gold quest.<br />Level 45.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wandered around, got slammed by a BUNCH of elites .. where is the damned treasure?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The quest can be done easy. Activate the quest by clicking on the map, click on the box at 52,94 by the mast, and run away. At a safe distance you will see five pirates appear. Then they break into two groups. Pick the group of two and fight them away from the others. You only need to kill one to get the key so once you finish off the two, loot the box and it is over. Easy to do but probably not worth the effort. I completed the quest solo as a 46 priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>map coods 52,94 there you will find the landmark click it and the box apears, also 5 pirats ambush you , kill them to get the key open it and have some fon .<br />i got some silver,few greens and some stuff to vendor</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can this be repeated if another three map segments found?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rzzr</b></h3>The pirates don't split up but stay as a group. It's a long corpse walk!</div>
