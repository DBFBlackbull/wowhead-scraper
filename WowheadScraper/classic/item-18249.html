To get the key you must enter the main entrance to Dire Maul East. You will find a little imp named Pusillin.

It is extremely easy, and can actually be done by as few as 3 good, well geared players.  I would suggest taking a full group of 5 so you get more people keyed, but it's not necessary as long as you have a good group make-up.\n\nThe classes you will NEED will be an AoE class (mage\/lock), a healing class (priest\/druid\/paladin\/shaman), and a tank class (warrior\/druid\/paladin).  For the purposes of these fights, and as easy as they are, you shouldn't be to concerned about your tank as long as your group knows what they are doing.  I was in a group that actually used a rogue as their tank for the whole time, and it worked out just fine.\n\nYou want to enter Dire Maul East from the central arena area.  Dire Maul East, obviously, is the Eastern entrance.  It is the only entrance without a locked door impeding it, and if that's not enough help as you enter the arena area and go to the right of the arena.\n\nWhen you first enter there will be some mobs out in front of you, but off to the right there will be a small imp romping around.  Go talk to that imp and he will talk about you having to catch him or some crap.  After that he runs off down the corridor.  From that point you will have to kill all the mobs between Pusilin and you.  Each time you get to him, talk to him as much as he'll talk, then he will turn and run. You will run all the way to the end of the corridor, killing mobs and talking to Pusilin along the way, and then take a left (you can't turn any other way).  Now you are facing east, do the same thing as before (there is an exit to DM east off to the south, but don't take that).  Now you'll turn left again and will be facing North.  Go all the way to the end of this path, killing and talking the whole way down.  At the end of the path Pusilin will take off down a hallway.  Follow him to the end of the hallway.  \n\nAfter you have come out of the hallway you walk into an area full of demons (Satyrs).  Kill your way to Pusilin, but be aware that there are stealthed Satyrs in here as well.  So be careful.  Pusilin will be out in the middle of the room.  Talk to him for the second to last time.  He will run away again, off to the right, and up a ramp.  Kill your way up that ramp, and Pusilin will be sitting on the landing behind where the ramp opens up at.  Now, get ready for a boss fight.  Mana up, buff up, and put on any fire resistance gear you have.  Talk to Pusilin for the last time and he summons 8-12 imps to come in and hammer your party.  They do fire damage, but are generally weak, so you can AoE these down.  A few seconds after you talk to Pusilin he will turn into a larger version of himself, and he will start doing fire damage as well.  His damage isn't insignificant either.  He can AoE, and melee, and both hit like dump trucks, but he's fairly weak armor and healthwise.  \n\nAfter he dies, loot his body, and enjoy your new key.  Everyone in your group can loot a key, not just one person.  So be sure EVERYONE snags it.","date":"2006-09-05T18:09:15-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SofaKingCool","importedSubject":"To get this key..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":3063827,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"its in my keyring!","date":"2006-07-08T04:31:56-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"seert","importedSubject":"its in my keyring!!!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":14,"id":3063829,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"And just did the keyrun with my hunter and my druid-mate.

For the purposes of these fights, and as easy as they are, you shouldn't be to concerned about your tank as long as your group knows what they are doing. I was in a group that actually used a rogue as their tank for the whole time, and it worked out just fine.<br /><br />You want to enter Dire Maul East from the central arena area. Dire Maul East, obviously, is the Eastern entrance. It is the only entrance without a locked door impeding it, and if that's not enough help as you enter the arena area and go to the right of the arena.<br /><br />When you first enter there will be some mobs out in front of you, but off to the right there will be a small imp romping around. Go talk to that imp and he will talk about you having to catch him or some crap. After that he runs off down the corridor. From that point you will have to kill all the mobs between Pusilin and you. Each time you get to him, talk to him as much as he'll talk, then he will turn and run. You will run all the way to the end of the corridor, killing mobs and talking to Pusilin along the way, and then take a left (you can't turn any other way). Now you are facing east, do the same thing as before (there is an exit to DM east off to the south, but don't take that). Now you'll turn left again and will be facing North. Go all the way to the end of this path, killing and talking the whole way down. At the end of the path Pusilin will take off down a hallway. Follow him to the end of the hallway. <br /><br />After you have come out of the hallway you walk into an area full of demons (Satyrs). Kill your way to Pusilin, but be aware that there are stealthed Satyrs in here as well. So be careful. Pusilin will be out in the middle of the room. Talk to him for the second to last time. He will run away again, off to the right, and up a ramp. Kill your way up that ramp, and Pusilin will be sitting on the landing behind where the ramp opens up at. Now, get ready for a boss fight. Mana up, buff up, and put on any fire resistance gear you have. Talk to Pusilin for the last time and he summons 8-12 imps to come in and hammer your party. They do fire damage, but are generally weak, so you can AoE these down. A few seconds after you talk to Pusilin he will turn into a larger version of himself, and he will start doing fire damage as well. His damage isn't insignificant either. He can AoE, and melee, and both hit like dump trucks, but he's fairly weak armor and healthwise. <br /><br />After he dies, loot his body, and enjoy your new key. Everyone in your group can loot a key, not just one person. So be sure EVERYONE snags it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>And just did the keyrun with my hunter and my druid-mate. Rather easy to get.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It can be soloed by a druid but it can be very frustrating. Keep stealthing to him, appear and talk to him and then get pummeled, you may wish to do this naked but you may die before you can finish the conversation without the extra armor. There are ghost npc that will attack you, make sure you can fight them were you won't agro anyone else. When you finally face Puslin he will call forth imps. I died and returned and used my aoe with fr plus any other potions improve my stats. Then you just have to take out puslin. Drop a fr pot wait till the cooldown ends then attack him in bear, stun and heal yourself when you need and drop the other fr pot when it runs out. its not easy and it took me 3 gos to get him but it is soloable, goodluck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Doors that need Crescent Key can't be opened using a truesilver skeleton key - gets a &quot;Skill not high enough&quot; message.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I hate that Imp ....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dire Maul (East), for anyone who's wondering.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>is this single use?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No, this key can be used over and over. Everyone in the group should be able to pick up a copy of it when Pusillin drops it.</div>
