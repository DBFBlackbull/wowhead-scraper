<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Even a modest drop rate would help immensely. Wildvine is used by all the main professions, and that keeps the demand high. If the drop rate increased to something more reasonable, there would not be as much demand becuase all of us could get more, more easily than it is now. I killed in the Hinterlands for 4 hours last night and got 4. And that was from the elites. That's just wrong. I had an herbalist with me, helping me gather them, and he did not get one drop from purple lotus in 4 hours.<br /><br />In addition, the stat increases on the really high level blue items we can make are horrible. Even on items that require 4-6 rare items to make, the increases are not very good. And you have to sell them at sky-high prices because it take you forever to gather the items. It's not fun to have to do days of mindless killing just to make a single high-level item to get your skills up, and then have to gouge someone because you had to buy 10 Wildvine at 10gold, becase it did not drop for you. <br /><br />Reasonable drop rates, and make the stats on those blue items we can make worth making a set you would use yourself for more than just a level or two.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Hinterlands!&nbsp; Drops a lot off of the trolls just east of the Flight Path.&nbsp; I find the drop rate to be very nice.&nbsp; I use as a alchemist, but it sells nice if you have spares.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The largest percentage of wildvine that I get as a drop comes from the skullsplitter warriors--and it's the warriors around Zul'mamwe. The others don't drop it as frequently and I have never gotten one off a beastmaster. I get one or two wildvine about every 10 kills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These occasional can be harvested along with purple lotus (in a similar fashion to swiftthistle with mageroyal and briarthorn)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where is the best place to farm the for wildvine at lvl 41?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just finshed doing a bunch of quests I had for the Jinta'Alor in the Hinterlands, after killing probably ~135 trolls I got 8 wildvine Keep in mind I was in a group with one other person though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>where can i find these? (I'm herbalist)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been herbing tons of purple lotus and I found ONE wildvine.<br /><br />60x Purple lotus.<br /><br />It must be wrong that it spawns in 10% of the plants. Just can't be.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>trolls in jintha alor drop these. its not a common drop though. i was selling these to npc vendors before i realized these would sell for 1-2 gold a piece in my server (ysondre).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It seems to me that the drop rate reflects the level difference between you and the mob who's dropping the Wildvine. (ie, more exp pts = better drop rate.)<br /><br />I went through the trolls near the Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound in STV and pulled in enough to do my wild leather quests, plus some leftover to sell. I came back a few levels later and couldn't get squat for drops from them.</div>

(ie, more exp pts = better drop rate.) </div><br />I find that with pretty much anything to do with drops. Which sucks, cause now I can't farm reliably and make money for myself. At level 54, the drop rate from these guys is dismal, and I'm stuck on the Wildvine armor of developing my skill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>can u buy these from any vendor?:D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i dont know why these things are so expecsive, besides the fact that they are used in the dreamweave stuff that tailors make. they drop like wiked often. im kinda sad that i didnt check how much they went for b4 i sold them on ah, i was selling them for like 10s a piece</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Abzalom is wrong.. first of all, there is no purple lotus in the swamp of sorrows.. <br /><br />second of all.. the drop rate listed on this site is averaged over thousands of purple lotus picked throughout the world, and just because you picked 10 somewhere and got lucky to have 4 drop.. does not mean that anyone else will have the same luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>its a component in wildvine potion, which for you folks with mana and health, means you only have to take one potion (if youre potion dependent) to regen both instead of picking between the two necessary things before that monster finishes wiping your party.<br />its a quick fix granted, but itll do in a pinch. the squishies i tank for tend to love me for havin a batch of this on hand (which in turn keeps me alive longer)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yay finially know where to get them... Need em for tribal leatherworking quests and don't feel like paying over 1g a pop on Darkspear...<br /><br />Looks like I'm off to the Hinterlands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There must be somethin wrong with ur server cause on mine and most others...Wildvine goes for 5-7g each<br /><br />I grinded 4 an hour, got 5, and got half the $ for my level 40 mount<br /><br />WOOT!<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 17th 2007 7:59pm by Vamithras</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The occurrence of Wildvine when harvesting Purple Lotus depends on the zone you're in. Ashenvale's Purple Lotus has a 10% chance of finding Wildvine. If you go to somewhere like Swamp of Sorrows, then Wildvine occurs a LOT more when harvesting Purple Lotus (40% rate).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Go to Sranglethorn Valley, and grind Skullsplitters for an our, or Vilebranch ... in The Hinterlands and you will have at least 4 or 5 wildvine's.<br />Grtz</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Why anyone would pay so much for these is beyond me</div>
