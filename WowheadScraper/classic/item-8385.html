Does he just restock at certain times and I'm not getting there fast enough or something? is there a better way to get this pattern?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Langmans</b></h3>Both of the NPC have this pattern as limited supply.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Leatherworking transititions into many mail armor recipes.&nbsp; Around this time shamans and hunters are getting the ability to wear mail and thus the leatherworking skill has some mail armor to go along with these classes</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has anyone found a reliable place to get this pattern?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have wasted so much time killing level 50 turtles to make the breastplate and now i have enough for the gloves, but i can't find a pattern for sale under 25g, wtf? <br />Its not an uber blue item guys, why are these morons setting bids at 25g, 50g, and so on?<br />I am half way done with elemental and i just want to finish the quest for the sake of finishing it. <br /><br />I recommend everyone to skip this quest, because the gold and exp you get is not worth the trouble. And you idiots selling this pattern for some insane price can suck it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This pattern is now suposed to be on a vendor, any idea what one?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I guess you can't please everybody. I actually appreciated the fact that this was so hard to find (and no, I'm not actually one of the rare few who has the pattern). When every leatherworker has the same recipe it dilutes the value considerably. The gloves were going for between 2-5g apiece on my server which seemed reasonable. I have yet to see a pattern up for auction.<br /><br />This is why it is hard to make money at AH on professions like leatherworking - I always grimace when I check AH for Gem-studded Leather Belts, a 'rare' blue item, and find some clown has flooded the market with 4 belts at the same time. It makes it hard to sell product for more than the component cost when 1 out 10 people on the server can make the item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hi Guy's,<br />I'm really glad, that they fixed this problem, but my question is now, did they fix it today or next week?<br />I've heard this patch announced will come Fr. 18th and not today, I hope this information is wrong, cause I need this really but I never found it...<br />I've been looking the AH the whole week but never seen this Pattern :-(<br />Neither I've never seen any Turtle Scale...<br />So I have killed about 500 Turtles in Dustwallow, to get them, after I've got them I walked to Ferlas und wanted to build my TSG's and saw that I don't have had this Pattern and was screwed<br />Now I'm at 234 in Leatherworking and can't go on with Tribal...<br />I really hope this Patch comes today...<br />Is anybody on german Server Gul'dan, who can help me and build this 2 Gloves for me or sell me the Pattern?<br />Many thx and good hopes the Patch will come today</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The pattern will be in a vendor. but the patch doing this hasnt been released yet<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/patchnotes/patch-07-03-2005.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wow-europe.com/en/patchnotes/patch-07-03-2005.html</a><br />and type in search &quot;turtle&quot; or something. this will show up:<br />Turtle Scale Gloves recipe has been added to vendors in Feralas to make completion of the tribal leatherworking quest easier.<br /><br />So i just have to wait for the upcomming patch :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The pattern is at Pratt McGruben(sp) but it is in limited supply (1?) and spawns less often than the Living Leggings he has. I spend 2 hours waiting and have nothing. :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can confirm that TS Gloves recipe can be bought from Pratt McGrubben. Typically....been looking for this recipe for days, was lucky to get one in AH for 50s, then ofcourse Patty turns up to have one in stock. Well, however. Its confirmed that he got them</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok, i read the latest patch and it SAYS that it is available at a vendor in Feralas, i've been to every vendor in Feathermoon, and Thalanaar, but found none, My last guess is in Diremaul. anyone know for sure where it is?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bought this pattern from Pratt McGrubben last night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I camped Pratt for 20 minutes while reading all these comments. It appeared for 31s 50c so it does work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone seen this lately?&nbsp; I camped hime last night and got 2 other patterns, but not this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>YES! This pattern is sold in Feathermoon at Pratt MCGrubben (alliance) and in Camp Mojache from Jangdor Swiftstrider (horde). The pattern sells for 31s50c at both vendors. <br /><br />I bought it from Pratt McGrubben, flew to Tanaris, farmed the turtle scales, flew back, and the pattern was there again. IT IS RESPAWNING! It takes about 10-15 min for each respawn. Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I for one decided to use the turtles as my grinding blocks at level 40 - after 10 hours rested, fly out to gadget (steemwheedle, 42/43 neutral turtles)&nbsp; and kill for about 10-15 scales - after a while I had meat for cooking, shell fragments for 45 sil (per 5), plenty of xp and enough thick leather to make the headbands/tunics/thick kits/turtle scale. <br /><br />Ofcourse if you want to buy your way through this quest run then it's your call - I actually found it a relaxing and rewarding quest set. <br /><br />I also got all wildvine from doing all stranglethorne troll related quests.<br />*edited, pointless dig removed*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did get this from the Horde leather supplier in Camp Mojache. However, I had to wait for an hour during a quiet period. First Living Leggings and Green Whelp bracers spawned, then both despawned. Then, after a while, Nightscape Shoulders spawned, and finally, the gloves. I sat there for at least and hour though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been waiting a good 2 hours for this to spawn on the horde guy in Feralas. The spawn time must be much longer than it is for Living Shoulders.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><br /><br />As for the Turtle Scale Gloves...<br /><br />Alliance Vendor: Pratt McGruben<br />Horde Vendor: Jangdor Swiftstrider<br /><br />Both vendor's drop a new pattern every 15-20 min.&nbsp; The problem is that there are 3 or 4 patterns at each vendor.&nbsp; Luckily, for me, the 2nd pattern dropped was the pattern for Turtle Scale Gloves.&nbsp; I waited for approximately 30 min.<br /><br />The obvious alternative to waiting is the AH.&nbsp; Good Luck guys.(##RESPBREAK##)4360##DELIM##Onyx1831##DELIM##Removed first part due to disrespect.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is the MOST ridiculous thing EVER!&nbsp; I have to wait to buy this rare spawn (it's not in the AH), make things that I've already made, just so I can learn patterns that are fairly useless, all so I can finally learn Tribal Leatherworking.&nbsp; Sheesh, if you wanted to make it balanced, blizz would make you slay Onyxia to learn Dragonscale.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You just have to be patient.&nbsp; I just got the pattern from the Horde vendor in 10 min.&nbsp; <br /><br />:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Been camping the pattern going on 4 hours now.&nbsp; I've seen all the others except this one.&nbsp; So just be prepared for a long wait if you try to camp them, for whatever that is worth.<br />It <i>may</i> be smarter to just simply check back every so often over the course of a few days.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is an annoying wait, but I camped out at the Horde vendor for about an hour and eventually the pattern spawned.&nbsp; At least on my server this seems the best way to go about it.&nbsp; No one had the pattern up for auction or responded to my WTB in the trade channel.&nbsp; Good luck to people looking for it.&nbsp; If anyone on Thorium Brotherhood needs these for the quest I'd be willing to make them free with materials to help you out since I know how annoying this quest is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Uther server. 4th trip to the vendor/trainer in feathermoon and no pattern. 5 minutes later there it was along with others that weren't there minutes before.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried all day to get this off the horde guy who sells it but it never showed up. So I just bought it off the ah for 10g. But then when I go to complete the quest, I checked and it was there for 35s :(<br /><br />So just wait for it to show up on the guy and save your money</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>there is bunch of Qs in feralas and u will turn in camp M at least 5 times or so, probably much more times... just check the vendor every time ure in camp M and eventualy he'll have the pattern. got mine yesterday on ThunderHorn (if u wanna craft it, /w tenehuini ;-)) gl all</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have bought the Living Shoulders and Green Whelp Bracers within 10 minutes. I hoping for the gloves on next respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Pratt has the pattern, for 31.50S, and it is a one-at-a-time sale. Didn't have to wait (probably lucky) but I suspect that it won't be too bad because Feralas is pretty deserted, at least on ER.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The glove pattern can be bought from the same guy that the quest is given from.&nbsp; It wasn't there when i first looked but i checked 10 mins later and found it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As soon as I found out they were at the vendor in Feathermoon, I camped for about 5 minutes and they popped up! Maby I was lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, Joe, you were lucky.<br /><br />For what its worth here's my experience.<br /><br />1:43 No patterns. Started checking every five minutes.&nbsp; For you skinners, there's 40-41 wolves dropping thick, heavy and meat to the west.<br /><br />2:27 Green Whelp Bracers appeared.&nbsp; Switched to ten minute checks.<br /><br />2:57 Living Shoulders.<br /><br />3:18 Green Whelp Bracers<br /><br />3:47 nothing else, went afk until<br /><br />4:31 Turtle Scale Gloves.&nbsp; <br /><br />So the Gloves weren't there for two hours, unless somebody slipped in while I was grinding the wolves.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wait was 2 hrs 11 mins (i kept track) saw living shoulders twice,nightscape shoulders and greenwhelp pattern all before the glove pattern finally spawned.... Hate the wild armor quests...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is there a merchant that sells the pattern: turtle scale gloves? which monster drops them most?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got it in a chest in uldaman, gave it to a guildie for 50s.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sold mine for 20 gold today on Hellscream, was kinda shocked to see they took my buyout, guess it is pretty rare indeed.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was reading the patch notes for today's patch.<br />This pattern will now be purchaseable from vendors in Feralas. Glee!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this pattern seems indeed very rare,<br /><br />It is sold bij Jangdor Swiftrider for Horde in Camp Mojache in Ferallas.<br />And by Pratt McGrubben in Silvermoon Stronghold for Alliance.<br />But it seems, they have a limited capacity of these patterns, and i dont know at which times they respawns, so if any ones knows how long you have to camp there to buy the pattern. Please let us know. <br />Thx</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok no merchent sells the turtle scaled glove pattern in feralas</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I also got this in Uldaman.<br /><br />~Z</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You've got to do something else for pattern to respawn on vendor. I waited for 30min continually talking to vendor - nothing. Then I trained a cheap pattern from trainer - went back to vendor and glove pattern was on there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think I know the answer to this riddle. He only sells one pattern at a time. Buy the one he offers and wait a couple minutes. Go back buy the next. I bought 2 other patterns before being able to buy this one. The other ones he sold me were ones I needed anyway and they were cheap.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went to Jangdor and baught the only pattern he had, then stopped talking to him and can back to him one min later and he had the glove pattern. The pattern's are only about 60 Silver so not that big of deal to pay for the others to get it to spawn on him. Hope this helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Finally bought the pattern from Jangdor Swiftstrider, after checking with him over a period of several days. Then went out to kill ogres, and the pattern dropped from one of them!<br /><br />Go figure.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This has been the WORST item to find that I have ever seen. Visited Jandor Swiftstrider in Ferala over 20 times since getting my first quest from him for the leatherworking and have yet to see this pattern. Have searched Thottbot and others, following up on any and all leads and finally just gave up and bought the damn thing at AH this morning. The other thing is that I have not seen the gloves themselves being sold at AH as I have been looking for those for over a week. Really, all you need is the freaking gloves (2 pairs) to finish the quest. So guess what? There now will be gloves for sale at the OG AH on the Kilrogg server for as long as I do leatherworking and will be reasonable so that poor guys like me no longer have to pull there hair out and spend a week chasing down an item like I have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I had to wait an hour and a half for it to cycle (every 30 minutes a new one pops up) but at 12:30 I checked and it was there! Cost a little over 31s, not too bad. Now I can FINALLY complete the leatherworking quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been standing in front of the vendor that supposedly sells this in Ferelas for about 2hours now. Nothing. No gloves, just the living shoulders pattern. I'm lvl40 and just finished the other two parts of the quest but I can't even start on this because the pattern will not show up. I have been told by so many that he is supposed to sell it, but he isn't doing anything. Not even the living shoulders pattern is popping up anymore I dunno what is up. I've gone to the AH and come back, I feel like a moron but I wanna finish this so bad. I'm thinking about contacting a GM but I doubt that will do anything. <br /><br />Final word on this, if you have less patience then me, I wouldn't worry about this one for awhile unless you are *that* dedicated to your leatherworking. Which, unfortunately for me, I am. /cry</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I literally JUST bought this pattern from Jangdor Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache, Feralas. He had four patterns for sale: the turtle scale gloves, green whelp bracers, living shoulders, and nightscape shoulders. After reading some of the horror stories below I was scared. Instead, guess I'm just lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Here's the deal...each of the merchants has about four limited quantity (1) patterns that they cycle through every 30 minutes. Horde side, this guy is Jandor Swiftstrider, in Feralas--the same guy who gives you the wild leather quests. If the pattern you're looking for isn't there, come back in 30 minutes. I have spent an hour and a half at this bubba, and no dice so far for me. You're better off picking them up at the AH.<br /><br />Alliance (quoted from kcunck): Speak to Pratt McGruben at Feathermoon Stronghold. He deals this pattern and also trains in Wild Leather. He is sort of hidden underneath the inn by a small birdbath/moonwell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bipolargirl</b></h3>The patterns from this vendor are a limited supply meaning only one is for sale at a time.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kozmosis</b></h3>Just got this off of a Mangy Silvermane in The Hinterlands right next to Aerie Peak</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pallygamist</b></h3>Checked in at Jangdor so I can do the Wild Leather Vest quest, he doesn't have it.
