<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Priests also uses them for levitate. It might be possible to get even more than 6 g for 20.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>id rather just go to barrens and slaughter every strider in sight for 20 mins</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Denfo</b></h3>Best place by far to farm these is in Thousand Needles, there's a harpy cave around 27,52 that constantly spawns as you're killing.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Headshot314</b></h3>I farmed these in the barrens at the dry hills /way 39 15<br />There are a bunch of different types of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=3276/witchwing-harpy">Witchwing</a> harpies each can drop light feathers.<br />I've only ever seen questers up there so its a nice farm with little competition.<br />Great for lower level toons especially.<br /><br />Over 30mins I farmed 177 harpies and was able to get 59 light feathers.<br />I also got 43 wool cloth, 63 linen cloth, and 1.29g in raw gold/greys.<br /><br />Doing stats with my data the drop rate of the light feathers is between 27.9% and 39.2% with a 90% credible interval.</div>
