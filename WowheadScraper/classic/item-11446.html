He is going o ask you to kill Angerforge and then the Golem lord all in BRD and get his lost information for him. Then you take that stuff back to windsor and the quest continues....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kern</b></h3>It seems as though Draenei are having a hard time with this quest. Reports are that they (Draenei) can not pick up this item as they're not being flagged as Alliance. Tseric has openly stated on the Blizzard forums that this is a bug that they are in the process of fixing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>anyone know if this can still drop for you while your in a raid?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yes it drops also from the ones before the instance. killed 2 slaves after giving the q in morgans vigil. <br /><br />good to know that you can do this alone :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The note is easy to get - and its a group loot item. You need to make sure you have finished Abandoned Hope first. If not, you won't be able to get the note. The quest line goes as follows:<br /><br />Dragonking Menace - The True Masters (all 4 parts. Takes you from Redridge, to SW, Redridge, then Morgan's Vigil in the Burning Steppes). Talk to Ragged John, then Marshal Maxwell. From there find Marshall Windsor in BRD and complete Abandoned Hope (going back to Vigil and talking to Maxwell). From here you need to find the crumpled note that drops. You get the quest &quot;A shred of hope&quot; turns into Jail Break then Stormwind Rendevous, and then the Great Masquerade. After given the gem you need to hit the cave in winterspring for the key to Onyxia's lair.<br /><br />In my opinion The Great Masquerade is one of the best quests. Very fun to sit back and enjoy. I would love to see more quests like this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i had to kill HUNDREDS of millions of them.

This is NOT an easy drop.<br /><br />I was killing the non elite 46-48 slaves outside of instance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hopelesshobo</b></h3>Can confirm this still drops from the non elite slaves on the outside of the instance. I had to clear them out a couple times, but it wasn't bad. Just make sure you already did the quest to talk to Marshal Windsor and turn in the report to the Marshal at the flight point in Burning Steppes before you start farming for the note.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Henderman</b></h3>I got this off of a slave outside the instance. I took me about 40 kills, not one or two like others have posted. But it does drop outside during Classic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gari22</b></h3>Killed 35 Quarry Slaves to get mine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shrikearghast</b></h3>Unfortunately (very unfortunately) you are likely to be grinding quarry slaves for a long... *sigh* <i>long</i> while. Some things to know:<br /><br /><ul><li>All quarry slaves are shaman-types - they have a heal and a lightning. Some of them also have a throw-knife ability, though apparently not all of them.</li><li>Quarry slaves are not supported by dark iron elites - pulling them will not chain dark irons, nor will runners alert them.</li><li>Quarry slaves <i>are</i> supported by other quarry slaves, and can chain pull, assist heal, etc. </li><li>This is a high-traffic area, and there are LOT of pissed off people on their way to BRD, fresh from being ganked/camped by the opposing faction. If you're on a PvP server, you should expect to be jumped. </li></ul></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rounlin</b></h3>got it second kill from slaves outside BRD. Still works in 2020</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Christianlw</b></h3>just got the note by grinding non dungeon mobs while in a raid group<br /><br />also the slaves hit HARD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>eggnoggins</b></h3>Yes, you NEED to turn in <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4242/abandoned-hope">Abandoned Hope</a> before this will drop.</div>
