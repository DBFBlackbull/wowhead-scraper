I am not sure how MUCH aggro you can count on from this however. Sheerly based on the damage done the aggro would seem to be trivial, and from personal use I have noticed a number of times nearby mobs which are NOT in combat will be hit by the AE (they get a \"glow\" when hit, and a message confirms the damage) but still do not aggro at all.

The only thing I can figure that Blizzard has in mind with this thing is as a prank. I've struggled to think of a situation in which this enchant would be useful, but I just can't. On the contrary, this enchant is beyond just benign--it's actually HARMFUL for the following reasons...\n\n1. The name of this item is Fiery Enchantment, which is extraordinarily close to Fiery Weapon Enchant (a very good enchant), the skill learnable by enchanters. This similarity alone makes this distinction confusing.\n\n2. This quest reward item does not bind to you when you pick it up. As a result, someone who completes this quest and is smart enough to realize that it is not the same as a Fiery Weapon Enchant can exploit the ambiguity in Reason #1 and sell it to a dupe on auction. Yes, I was such a dupe, and bought it for just under the normal price for a Fiery Weapon Enchant. Please learn from my idiotic mistakes and don't buy this item from auction.\n\nNow, all of this wouldn't be such a big deal if this was a decent enchant. But it's not. Not only is it a crappy enchant, it will actually HARM you for the following reasons...\n\n1. When the enchant procs, the proc damage (10-15) REPLACES the damage you would ordinarily do with your weapon. So, my 150-200 single hit damage is replaced with 10-15 damage. Thus, this enchant actually LOWERS your DPS, unless you are level 3 or below.\n\n2. The proc is an AOE effect that hits all mobs within a certain radius. This makes you a terrible choice to join a party in an instance. I would actually kick you out of my party if I found out you came in the instance with this enchant on your weapon. The reason being, this would cancel out all crowd-control effects (sheep, frozen, sap), unless you pulled all the other mobs out of the AOE radius before it procced. That is one extra thing that I don't want to have to think about.\n\nAll of these things add up to indicate that either someone at Blizzard is pulling a practical joke with this, or someone made it broken and forgot to fix it. The other bad part about this is that once you enchant something, you can't remove it unless you get another enchant to replace it.\n\nYou have been warned. If you do this quest, throw it away or give it to a level 3 player. Please don't put it up for auction for 25 gold.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A little trick that you should use with this enchant:<br /><br />Put the enchant on a item that is white, so it is able to be passed on from character to character. Make sure the weapon that you choose is mostly universal for all classes. Then you can send that weapon to one of your other characters to help level. Since it is white, you can even sell it for big bucks after you are &quot;done&quot; with it. Works great for low level areas and helps you level at an insane rate. Just a word of advice for anyone who doesnt want to sell or make this enchant go to waste.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is meant to go on Ravager (Herod's big axe) for warrior AE grinding. I also use it in ZF in the bug room to clear out scarabs fast. Get them all whacking you and rage builds fast, spam HS or w/e, and the ravager proc handles the rest. The AE proc will also trigger Ravager's Blade Flurry, so you can go for a minute or two spinning and killing. If your party understands simple instructions, they simply train the bugs to you, you Whirlwind and go back to Defensive for aggro building (or Bladeflurry is proccing while you're in Defensive), and the healer spams heals on you, and everyone gets their uncracked shells in jig time.<br /><br />Can't imagine many other uses for this though, besides maybe farming wool or medium leather or some silly thing. Certainly no non-plate wearer should even consider it. It's for drawing aggro from lots of things at once, but not for keeping it without something to generate more hate, like a Berserker Stance Whirlwind, or the Blade Flurry proc of Ravager.<br /><br />The idea of a rogue putting it on a dagger, or some silly stuff like that... yech. Bits of rogue all over the place.<br /><br />It's definitely a niche enchant, and a darned small niche at that. (Yes, I mean niche, not nice.)</div>

And let's not even get into aggro'ing the otherwise neutral scarabs.<br /><br />I even bought the materials for an enchanter to enchant my mace with something else, anything else. I was so happy to see it gone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What does Fiery Blaze do?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>20G+ in the AH, this enchant is worthless. proc chance sucks, damage sucks, and no color effect to weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there are a few uses for this, although I would agree that it's not the best proc in most cases.<br /><br />the AE proc is pretty frequent, and does a pretty good job of taking out shaman totems and those very-low-hp but high-damage swarms that some mobs summon while you fight them.<br /><br />Some tanks might also appreciate the ability to get aggro on all mobs in the area (especially non-consecrate paladins, who have no other means besides healing of getting aggro from multiple mobs). I am not sure how MUCH aggro you can count on from this however. Sheerly based on the damage done the aggro would seem to be trivial, and from personal use I have noticed a number of times nearby mobs which are NOT in combat will be hit by the AE (they get a &quot;glow&quot; when hit, and a message confirms the damage) but still do not aggro at all. I don't know whether there is a bug that produces the messages/graphic effect when they really are not being hit, or if the damage done is below some threshold, or what. <br /><br />The damage WILL, however, break sheep and hunter traps and such, as mentioned above.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm writing this as a warning to players about this item. The only thing I can figure that Blizzard has in mind with this thing is as a prank. I've struggled to think of a situation in which this enchant would be useful, but I just can't. On the contrary, this enchant is beyond just benign--it's actually HARMFUL for the following reasons...<br /><br />1. The name of this item is Fiery Enchantment, which is extraordinarily close to Fiery Weapon Enchant (a very good enchant), the skill learnable by enchanters. This similarity alone makes this distinction confusing.<br /><br />2. This quest reward item does not bind to you when you pick it up. As a result, someone who completes this quest and is smart enough to realize that it is not the same as a Fiery Weapon Enchant can exploit the ambiguity in Reason #1 and sell it to a dupe on auction. Yes, I was such a dupe, and bought it for just under the normal price for a Fiery Weapon Enchant. Please learn from my idiotic mistakes and don't buy this item from auction.<br /><br />Now, all of this wouldn't be such a big deal if this was a decent enchant. But it's not. Not only is it a crappy enchant, it will actually HARM you for the following reasons...<br /><br />1. When the enchant procs, the proc damage (10-15) REPLACES the damage you would ordinarily do with your weapon. So, my 150-200 single hit damage is replaced with 10-15 damage. Thus, this enchant actually LOWERS your DPS, unless you are level 3 or below.<br /><br />2. The proc is an AOE effect that hits all mobs within a certain radius. This makes you a terrible choice to join a party in an instance. I would actually kick you out of my party if I found out you came in the instance with this enchant on your weapon. The reason being, this would cancel out all crowd-control effects (sheep, frozen, sap), unless you pulled all the other mobs out of the AOE radius before it procced. That is one extra thing that I don't want to have to think about.<br /><br />All of these things add up to indicate that either someone at Blizzard is pulling a practical joke with this, or someone made it broken and forgot to fix it. The other bad part about this is that once you enchant something, you can't remove it unless you get another enchant to replace it.<br /><br />You have been warned. If you do this quest, throw it away or give it to a level 3 player. Please don't put it up for auction for 25 gold. And whatever you do, don't buy it for any amount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just wondering if this is a one time use item or if you can use it over and over?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>any word on how much dmg this does? or how whether it actually makes any kind effect on the weapon visually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Finished the quest, put this on <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10761">Coldrage Dagger</a>. Had it proc with both effects in one hit. Very strange, but it worked =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Want to know the most frustrating part of Arathi Basin as a rogue?<br />We have no true area of effect spells. Sure, we have Blade flurry, which attacks 1 other person. But even BF won't help when a lot of players pile ontop of the flag.<br /><br />Solution: Enchant your weapons with the Fiery Blaze!<br /><br />Okay. Okay, so the damage it actually does is more or less just a fly bouncing off your enemy's armor... But, that's not the point. This enchant interrupts flag capturing.<br /><br />That's why I put it on my Grand Marshal maces. They were extra weapons, heh.<br /><br />Yeah, I did pay someone 20 gold, and helped them get the quest started and finished.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crunchwrap0909</b></h3>Lol.............I got it within 3 mobs, from the small whelps. A moment of silence for peoples spent time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Beyondfubar</b></h3>Lot of people talking about how this can break sheep and sap.<br /><br />It's range is 3 yards. If you're tanking within 3 yards of targets that are breakable CC'd you are already risking dumb things. As the female orcs say, go whole hog, put a spear through your head.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ardensus</b></h3>Similar to libram enchants, these can be sold to other people by using it on their items in &quot;Will not be traded&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gizzet</b></h3>If you are caster (mage/priest/warlock) and have no use for this item you can sell it like an enchantment. I got a reply for a quick 15g but you could probably haggle for more. They just put it in the &quot;will not be traded&quot; slot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tester0365</b></h3><b><u>Since there seemingly isn't a comment on it yet ... </u></b><br /><b>Yes</b>, this enchantment can crit <b>and</b> trigger <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20059/vengeance">Vengeance</a> as a Paladin, making it incredibly useful for AoE farming (with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20293/seal-of-righteousness">Seal of Righteousness</a> for an increased proc chance).<br /><br />Imo the best weapons to enchant with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=6296/enchant-fiery-blaze">Fiery Blaze</a> for AoE farming are <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12794/masterwork-stormhammer">Masterwork Stormhammer</a> (can't crit though) or <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19968/fiery-retributer">Fiery Retributer</a> (can crit and proc Vengeance).<br /><br />In this Reddit post the attached Youtube video showcases Masterwork Stormhammer with the Fiery Blaze enchant:<br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b1dr5c/masterwork_stormhammers_chain_lightning">https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b1dr5c/masterwork_stormhammers_chain_lightning</a><br /><br />I'd advise you to keep the item in your bank and enchant your weapon of choice once you get a hold of it. If you want multiple copies of the enchantment, another player can complete the quest and enchant your weapon (but potentially for a rather hefty sum).<br /><br /><b>BONUS TIP:</b><br />If you enjoy AoE farming and proccing Vengeance for that sweet increased damage (especially for <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20924/consecration">Consecration</a>) consider getting a hold of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12632/storm-gauntlets">Storm Gauntlets</a> and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17111/blazefury-medallion">Blazefury Medallion</a> as well (since both of their abilities can crit). Also, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12628/demon-forged-breastplate">Demon Forged Breastplate</a> scales with spell power, which fits perfectly into a Paladins AoE farming arsenal alongside a bunch of T2 or T2.5 and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=9910/thorns">Thorns</a>-like items such as <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1168/skullflame-shield">Skullflame Shield</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11669/naglering">Naglering</a> etc. (check the comment made by &quot;krikcrack&quot; on Naglering for a list of Thorns-like consumables, spells and items - but stray towards using as many T2, T2.5 or other plate armor pieces with spell power for Consecration).</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
