I sent a ticket to a GM maybe they will fix it sooner or later GRAWR</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've found it in the Night Run Camp inside a very, very small &amp; tiny tent.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found the oil at 80,49 after MUCH searching... was behind some tree.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found it at 80,49 behind a tree.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found it immediately at the tents to the right as you enter Satyrnaar. Guarded by a few mobs, no biggie if you take them one at a time or bring a friend. Hover around and you'll see it. Looks like a green jug. Just remember it's on the ground, not a drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dropped this oil in a camp under a tent and i was with a friend who was searching this too. We stay one hour in the same camp and not appear, so we went in an other camp and we found it, Consequently, if you want find the Warsong oil look in all the camp between raynewood retreat and splintertree post.. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found in the middle of the camp at 79,44<br /><br />It's an upright yellow barrel</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The oil does jump from inbetween those 3 camps and that is that!<br />Also once you loot it your party mates can find tons of them in the same camp you got the first one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is a&nbsp; random spawn, it's in one camp at a time, when someone picks it up it respawns in another camp. I found mine in xavian (third character attemting to do the quest, first to suceed ^^). That, together with the data collection that shows white areas in all three camps as well as people stating that they've found it in the different camps support my theory. Hence the poster before me is incorrect in his statement that he alone describes the exact location, since it's quite obvious there are several.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found it at 80,50 in front of the some tents i also so another on there next to a bush</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>pardon the spelling, found it at 80,49, between two tents infront of them, yellow jug, one warsong oil :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>found it at 81, 50</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the oil is not just in the tents.&nbsp; It is also buy the trees south of the tents.&nbsp; This is good to know cuz i was searching for about a half hour at the top of the camp, if u cant find it up top check down below</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This was very easy for me, as a lvl 22 warrior.<br />Just run in to where the mug is, get all the agro from all mobs around, use Intimedating shout(the fear effect),Loot and be happy =)</div>
