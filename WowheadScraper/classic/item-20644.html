<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can get this &quot;object&quot; from each of the four dragons guarding the portals to the Emerald Dream(i belive is Emerald Dream not sure :D) they are found in Feralas,Hinterlands,Ashenvale and Duskwood. -Underkiller Bloodhoof</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i really enjoy reading the warcraft history:)<br />and i like these posts bether than the ones from 12yo kids who write like retards, dont you? more &quot;warcraft history posts&quot; GOGOGO!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item drops from the 4 Green Dragons guarding the Gates to the Emerald Dream, it drops every time they are killed, just like the Heart of Hakkar, Head of Ossirian, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />This does trigger an event in Moonglade, only not the Eranikus Event, that is the Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest Event to fight Eranikus and obtain the Green Scepter Shard.&nbsp; How to start that event I am not entirely sure, but you have to be able to kill Broodlord Lashlayer to move forward in the chain, and at least neutral with the Brood of Nozdormu to even start the Scepter Shards part of the chain.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Event from this item is of Malfurion Stormrage appearing next to Remulos after he cleanses the quest item, and the two of them speaking.&nbsp; Stormrage is informing Remulos of the fight that is occuring in the Emerald Dream, and also telling him about the well-being of Cenarius and Illidan.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cenarius died in Azeroth, but his link to the Emerald Dream from Ysera brought him life in there.&nbsp; Illidan was &quot;defeated&quot; by Arthas, but no one said anything about him being killed.&nbsp; All we know is that Arthas whooped the snot out of him, and he returned to Outland, driven to insanity by the defeat.&nbsp; <br /><br />So no more talking about them.&nbsp; <br /><br />The quest reward is:&nbsp; Malfurion's Signet Ring,&nbsp; with +17 stam. and 20 NR.&nbsp; This is a very nice NR ring for use in AQ40 and will more than likely only be used for that as well, so comparing it to other rings is pointless since it has no more use than getting your NR up for AQ40 fights.&nbsp; <br />And all is well.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><i>Actually, Illidan probably was intended to be dead. There is no mention of his survival in WC3 FT, and I'm no doctor, but the blow he took in the cutscene looked fatal to me.... Blizz probably decided to change that into a &quot;retreat&quot; after they realized that he could be used in WoW. </i><br /><br />ACTUALLY..<br />In the .mpq compressed file of the game there is an audio file where Arthas says: &quot;You are a pitious creature, Illidan. You don't even deserve an honorable death. Leave this world, and never return. If you do, I'll be waiting.&quot;<br /><br />Meaning Arthas spared his life.<br /><br />So NO, Blizz didn't change it to &quot;retreat&quot;, it was &quot;retreat&quot; all along.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>what does this turn into, what are the rewards for it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just dropped from one of the new dragons. <br />Ysondre in duskwood. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>epix!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>An'Qiraj(or however its spelled), the up and coming new dungeon, think thats where the nature resistance is for.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Looking at the current game content the reward is to say the least pathetic. However, I think that nature resistance will be well needed in future instances. So I guess it is epic due to a reason.<br /><br />The questitem drops of all dragons afaik (only killed 2, among the first in Europe to mention :P) much likes Onyxia drops her head all the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just killed the undead dragon Emeriss in Duskwood. He dropped it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>That item will give you a quest... you have to go to talk with teh Keeper Romorus.. in moonglade... <br />the Reward is a Ring called:<br />Malfurion's Signet Ring<br />Binds when Picked UP<br />Uniqe<br />Finger<br />+17 Stamina<br />+20 Nature Resistance<br />Requires lvl 60</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
