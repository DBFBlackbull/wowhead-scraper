The tactic of working your way around the island so the first ones you fought have respawned by the time you get back around is a good one.

Makes me think only about one elemental on the island actually has an elemntal water at a time (there are 13-20 elementals on the island at any one time by my count).\n- A lot of the elementals drop nothing. I only saw one Azuredeep Shards drop per mob. Only 1 elemental water per mob (when it did drop). You can get up to 5 enchanted waters at one time (that's the most I got at one time). You can get all three items from a single kill sometimes (what I call a \"juicy\" mob).\n- May be a coincidence but 15 of the 17 elemental waters I got were from elementals on the southern\/southeastern part of the island. \n- The elementals swimming in the water off the northwest part of the island almost never had any loot at all and when they did it was 1 Azuredeep Shards or 1 Enchanted Water.\n\n(Sent the Elemental Waters to a tailoring friend, sold the shards to a vendor, still don't know if I should bother AHing the Enchanted Water. Also, on my way back to Booty Bay I stopped to mine some iron and had to kill a Cold Eye Basilisk nearby. It dropped the Cold Basilisk Eye trinket.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>CAn this be made with Alchemy skill or does it only drop?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate from cresting exile in arathi is totally wrong, i killed 44 of this and dropped only 2 elemental water (4,54% drop), i'm a lvl 43 holy priest, is there a good place for me where i can fam this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the best place to farm this is in STV, on the big island... there are a lot of water elements (lvl 36/37) and their drop rate is like 11%, good luck =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>20/20 I think blizzard likes me ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I killed over 100 cresting exiles yesterday and received 75 enchanted water, 35 crests and only 1 elemental water. Based on this drop rate I should have gotten approximately 10 elemental waters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Saying that the droprate is wrong cause you got 2 elementals out of 44 kills is just lame. If you look really close you see that allakhazam got it's droprate out of 58.000 kills, and if you knew just a tiny bit about statistics, you would know that such a large source is more reliable.<br />What you just said is like me saying that I got no elemental waters out of 1 kill, thus the droprate is 0%</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I know the stats disagree, but I've been taking turns grinding the Lesser Water Elementals in STV and Cresting Exiles in Arathi and I've been getting a <i>lot</i> more Elemental Water drops in <b>STV</b>... <br /><br />Also, if you start at one end of that island in STV and work your way to the other side (lengthways) the first mobs will be freshly respawned again by the time you reach the end; rinse repeat. Cresting Exiles on the other hand are a smaller pop so you'll always have downtime waiting for respawn. Obviously your server load will alter any respawn rates, so there may be times when Arathi grinding is desirable... I doubt it though. <br /><br />In short; stick with Lesser Water Elementals in STV if you want Elemental Water.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PaoC</b></h3>Classic WoW<br /><br />Farmed at Felwood from Toxic Horrors during the quiet hours (around 3am)<br /><br />I used 5x Bobbing Apples as a measure of time (15min x 5pieces = 75minutes)<br /><br />Elemental Water dropped: : 7 (4%)<br /><br />Toxic Horrors Killed: 104</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fabflippintastic</b></h3>Feralas. Sea spray and Sea Elementals, on the coastline by the boat to Feathermoon Stronghold. Killed all the mobs on the entire coastline, twice, not a single drop. Would not recommend.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aneyhla</b></h3>In Season of Mastery, i got one from some Stranglekelp. However the drop rate seems to be very low...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Guggenheim</b></h3>As of Season of Mastery, Elemental Water can now be found in <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/object=2045/stranglekelp#comments:id=5286308">Stranglekelp</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hellenica</b></h3>As of late 2024 (Nov) the price of Elemental Water has plumetted below 2G per unit, while the drop rate is the same. Not worth the grind.</div>
