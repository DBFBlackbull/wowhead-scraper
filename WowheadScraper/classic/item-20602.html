<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Alot of people are asking why the person who turns in the quest reward should get the booty from the chest of spoils.<br /><br />Allow me to explain it to you.<br /><br />One person has a ring - that ring could be sold easily for about 150g but instead they summon one of these bosses.<br /><br />To get the ring in the first place takes countless large brilliant shards and sets or twilight gear. It is no trivial task.<br /><br />The summoner obviously cannot down the boss on his own so he invites some guildmates and/or randoms. They are rewarded with a chance to roll on some pretty serious epic drops (25% drop rate) which cannot be gotten from anywhere else in the game as well as a good chance to drop some pretty nice blues too.<br /><br />Why anyone would expect the summoner to put all this work in to get a ring just so he could share with some randoms who turned up for 15 minutes I have no idea.</div>
