Although Shamans are secondary healers, we rely heavily on melee for dps.\n\n2) Alternatives: There are many other alternative weapons for casters, including: Sorcerous Dagger, many staves (Dominance, Amberseal, Benediction, to name a few), Jin'Do's Hexxer, Aurastone Hammer, Azuresong Mageblade, not to mention many pvp weapons. These weapons arent as good for shamans as you can see, because they have less dps.\n\n3) Windflurry: If Windflurry gave 2 extra attacks 20% of the time to two weapons, one slow and one fast, they would end up with the same dps over time (easy to prove mathematically).\n\nHowever, Windflurry not only gives extra attacks but it also adds +665 attack power, which adds a flat amount of damage to each attack. This extra damage will get added more times over time with a fast weapon because WF will proc more.\n\n4) Flurry Talent: For enhancement Shaman's that don't care about pvp and big hits, a fast weapon speed is great because of the Flurry talent that give a 30% attack speed increase if we gain a crit. If we strike more often, we're going to get a crit more often and get +30% to attack speed more often. If you compare a slow weapon and a fast weapon that both have a dps of 50, they still have the same dps after Flurry, the only difference is the fast weapon will have this speed increase more often.\n\n\nSo in summary, yes the dagger is definitely good for all casters, but it is PERFECT for Shamans and they should be given first priority to get it, especially considering that the other caster weapon alternatives are not that great for Shamans. Non-casters rolling or bidding on this are very stupid and greedy people indeed, especially considering how many high dps daggers and weapons exist now.\n\n\nEdited, Tue Sep 27 17:18:55 2005","date":"2005-09-27T20:48:25-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"GraveWalkerX","importedSubject":"Shamans first"},{"commentv2":1,"number":14,"id":3059670,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"this dagger seriously sucks\n\ngo to ZG and get Fang of Venoxis.  it pwns this in the face and is easier to get.","date":"2006-03-10T06:46:58-06:00","rating":-9,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"die please, kkthnxbye","creationdate":"2006-03-18T09:01:40-06:00","id":1277284,"rating":-10,"commentid":3059670,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Adonzo","importedSubject":"RE: wow"},{"body":"[quote=Adonzo]this dagger seriously sucks\n\ngo to ZG and get Fang of Venoxis.  it pwns this in the face and is easier to get.[\/quote]\n\nI have the Fang of Venoxis and just picked this up today can can truly say it pwnz the &*!@ out of Fang of Venoxis.

Hmmmm lets see how good they are for a rogue:\n\n+1% crit chance with SPELLS: ROGUES YOU DO NOT HAVE SPELLS THIS DOES NOT HELP YOU.\n\n+10 Intellect: ROGUES INTEL IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE STAT FOR YOU.\n\n+4 mana every 5 secs: ROGUES YOU DO NOT HAVE MANA!\n\nSo... the only reason a rogue would roll on this is for DPS... well ok i will say you rogues can roll on this if there is NO shamans\/druids\/priests\/mages in the group, good luck killing azuregos without us.\n\nThirdly, read the name. It is called the FANG OF MYSTICS. ARE YOU A MYSTIC? NO.

Yes, it's great for melee fighters too because of DPS, but DPS is not everything. Casters have just as much right to this item as anyone else, especially if they can use it and it's better than the weap they have. A staff is a melee weapon, too, and yet you have no problems with us having THAT kind of melee weapon? As a warlock, my character starts off with a dagger in its hand.  Not only is it the first and original melee weap that a warlock knows instinctively (I'd have to go train for staves), but the fang of mystics also has good caster stats. Are there better weaps out there for casters? Sure. Does it mean I have said better item and don't deserve this one? No. Are there weaps out there with better enhancements suited for warriors or rogues? (last time I checked, MANA regen or a better chance for casting cricital SPELLS had no benefit for a warrior or rogue whatsoever) Of course there are, so your logic here is flawed. Just because it has high DPS does not mean that it's not good for a caster type or that a caster can't use it... if that were the case, why would Blizz put caster enhancements on it?  And nowhere does this weapon say it's ONLY meant to be used for MC\/Onyxia. You're trying to tell me that if you were to get this as a drop that you'd ONLY use it for MC\/Onyxia? ROFL riiiiight.\n\nBottom line? If this weap was meant for a few specific classes ONLY, Blizz would have put a restriction on it as such, but that's not the case... so who are you to tell one class they have no right to it over another?  If someone finds use in it or planned to use it, they have just as much right as anyone else. Just because you don't agree with someone else's play style doesn't mean they're wrong.

This particular dagger has an incredibly high max and minimum damage on it therefore increasing the amount of backstab and ambush damage that occurs (for rogue classes obviously).

Since the weapon\nspeed doesn't affect the frequency at which you can sinister strike or\nbackstab, you end up having the dps bonus from attack power MULTIPLIED\nby the speed of the weapon.\n\nBasically if you have a 1.5 speed weapon, you will get 1.5 times the\nDPS bonus from your attack power added to the base damage of the\nstrike and possibly multiplied by some other factor like 1.5 (or 20%\nmore with opportunity) from backstab or even 2.5 from ambush.\n\nNow if we're talking about a 2.0 speed weapon, you get your attack\npower bonus multiplied by two which is better. Now it is to evaluate\nis it more interesting to have a faster weapon but much higher base\ndps or a slower weapon with even lower dps to get that big bonus from\nattack power.\n\nThe answer is to get the slowest weapon the possible as some level 60s\ncan have anywhere between 450-650 attack power accounting for some\n30-45dps bonus from attack power. Resulting in 45 base damage weapon\nfor a 1.5 speed weapon or 60 base damage weapon for a 2.0 speed\nweapon. Now I'm telling you one thing. That's 15 base damage more, 3\ntimes the best enchant you can get (for straight dmg enchant) and that\n15 damage can be multiplied by some other factor. It can be even more\nthe higher the attack power you get.\n\nNow that weapon has the same base damage as the Felstriker but is a\nworse weapon because felstriker is slower... which is better.\n\nThe following are all better dagger for backstabing\/ambushing\/sinister\nstriking than Fang of the Mystics:\n\nBarman Shanker\nFelstriker (only the proc itself makes it better than Barman Shanker)\nGutgore Ripper (best atm: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/item=36280)\n\nEven better than Gutgore Ripper accounting for weapon speed alone is\nthe newly to come dagger off the PvP System in next patch:\nThe Grand Marshall's Dirk:\nhttp:\/\/worldofwarcraft.com\/info\/underdev\/images\/honor-system\/ssweapons.jpg\n\nWhat saddens me the most is some of the very rude reply by some of you\nguys, that sadly hadn't read the fact and unfortunately didn't know\nwhat they were talking about.\n\nNow I'm telling you one thing, Fang of the Mystics will indeed strike\n33% more often than barman shanker, but your chance to proc a poison\nis 30%, so basically your damage ouput from poison overall from the\nmain hand will be increased by 10%, and much less than that if you\ntake into account the number of proc from SS and from off-hand... that\ngain in damage is meaningless compared to the gain in damage from the\nbase damage bonus from attack power each sinister\nstrike\/backstab\/ambush. End of the story.\n\nThat dagger for rogue is at best a good off-hand weapon but the mods\non distracting dagger makes it better and easier to get.

There is exactly ONE dagger in the entire game currently that is comparable to this for a Rogue, and that's the \"Felstriker\".  Claims that \"extra agility on your class-specific dagger make up for the lack of DPS\" are completely ridiculous, as daggers with the highest agility, like Widowmaker, only add a total of 15 attack power.  15 attack power results in maybe one more displayed DPS, whereas this dagger is going to boost your damage output substantially with either hand.   The mods are totally irrelevant in this calculation, all that matters is the bottom line: min\/max damage, and overall DPS.   As for people who might claim \"but it has obvious caster mods, and is therefore better for a cloth wearer\", I ask this question: since when does a cloth wearer melee anything above like level 30?  That's right, you don't, you do all your damage with spells.  Which means that the 51.7 DPS is irrelevant, and that you're essentially using an item that gives +10 intellect, about +5 spirit, and 1% extra chance to crit with spells.\n\nAnd if you think that that 1% extra crit chance is important, let me put it into prespective.  Let's say you're an Arcane Mage, and you use Arcane Missles as your primary damage dealer.  At level 60, a barrage of five missles inflicts 192 * 5 damage, or 960 total damage.  If you crit with your spell, assume that it's doing 960 * 1.5 = 1440 damage.  That's a grand total difference of 480 damage, which you now inflict 1% more often because of the dagger. 1% of 480 = 4.8 damage, so this dagger is adding an average of 4.8 damage per volley to your Arcane Missles.  If there was a dagger that did 5-10 damage(it might as well since you don't melee), had +10 Intellect, +5 spirit, and said \"+4.8 Arcane Damage\" would you be arguing that it's totally uber for your class?  I truly doubt it.  \n\nSo that should be the end of the argument: Fang of the Mystics MASSIVELY increases the DPS of any dagger-using rogue, it is matched only by Felstriker, and it is considerably worse than many green items for a cloth wearer.  If you roll for this as a Priest, Mage or Warlock with a \"N\" rogue in your group, YOU are the greedy bastard.\n\nEdited, Sat Mar 26 16:26:09 2005","date":"2005-03-26T22:19:19-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Considering that the cloth wearers are the reason that the Rogue is even alive to see the dagger drop,  I'd think we get priority.

So, it's average damage per swing is 40. For this particular weapon, 20 dps = 40 damage per hit. So in this case, your average damage will go up 40 damage points due to your attack power bonus. \n\nWeapon #2: \n40 average damage, 2.00 speed = 20 dps \n+40 average damage = 80 average damage, 40 dps. \n\nBoth weapon #1 and #2 have the same DPS, but weapon #2 is a much better mainhand weapon. Obviously there are no 1.00 speed weapons, but the point still holds. \n\nAll this explains why, for instance, the Toxic Revenger ends up having a slightly higher damage range than the Black Menace. Black Menace has an average damage of 44.5 @ 1.5s. Toxic Revenger, on the other hand, has an average damage of 39 @ 1.9s. The Black Menace has a much higher DPS, but since the average damages are so close, you'll notice that your tooltip damage range will be slightly higher with the Revenger, assuming you have a reasonable attack power. \n[\/quote]\n\nNow the amount of damage you would gain off poison by chosing a weapon twice as fast is probably ridiculously low compared to the instant damage gained from Sinister Strikes or bstab ambush.\n\nI'm astonished to see that some people think they know @#$% because they don't use the blizzard forums... although there's some very good and worthwhile information.\n\nThose probably are the same person picking Vile Poisons talent instead of improved isntant poison.","date":"2005-04-07T18:29:13-05:00","rating":-9,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"xakor","importedSubject":"Not for rogues"},{"commentv2":1,"number":124,"id":3059781,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I used to be saving points for this dagger, but now (1.10), the 50+ dps is gone and it's just another caster dagger.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>STOP POSTING!<br /><br />Here is the breakdown for those of you that have poor understanding of how stats configure.<br /><br /><b>10 Intellect</b><br />Every 1 int = 15 mana.&nbsp; So 10 int x 15 mana = 150 mana.&nbsp; Pretty decent.&nbsp; This also increases with mana pool % talents.<br /><br /><b>+1% to crit with spells</b><br />To the person who said &quot;so tiny, you wouldn't eve notice it&quot;, you my friend need to learn what you're talking about.&nbsp; It takes <b>100 INT</b> to equal +1% crit for a caster, so an item that does this is the crit equivalent of 100 int!&nbsp; Also, there are very few caster items that add to crit with spells making this extremely desirable for any caster.<br /><br /><b>+4 mana regen every 5 seconds</b><br />If you don't do end-game content (i.e. Molten Core, Onyxia, BWL etc.) then you obviously wouldn't understand how valuable this is.&nbsp; But to break it down for the less educated crowd, fights in these instances can last a very long time, 15 minutes or more for some bosses.&nbsp; Now, 4 mana every 5 seconds x 60 seconds = 48 mana per minute.&nbsp; Assuming you're fighting for 5 minutes (some fights last longer) that's 240 mana. So in a 5 minute fight this regen rate is equivalent to 16 int!&nbsp; In a longer fight, even more.&nbsp; This means more heals, more dispels, and your groups survivability goes up a notch.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDIT: Forgot to mention that mana regen items such as this apply even during casting AND during the 5 second after-cast penalty, making mana regen superior to spirit.<br /><br />51 dps?&nbsp; Who cares, seeing as how daggers with 45 dps AND rogue stats turn out to equal more damage than just a 51 dps with NO ROGUE STATS. Agility adds to rogue crit %, atk power adds damage, strength adds damage.&nbsp; If a 45 dps weapon had stats like this, it would equal more than 51 dps.&nbsp; In other words, rogues, stop simply looking at DPS, it is meaningless. Please shut up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon should go to Shamans first, and here is why.<br /><br />1) Melee DPS Important: Fang is the highest dps caster dagger in the game. Although Shamans are secondary healers, we rely heavily on melee for dps.<br /><br />2) Alternatives: There are many other alternative weapons for casters, including: Sorcerous Dagger, many staves (Dominance, Amberseal, Benediction, to name a few), Jin'Do's Hexxer, Aurastone Hammer, Azuresong Mageblade, not to mention many pvp weapons. These weapons arent as good for shamans as you can see, because they have less dps.<br /><br />3) Windflurry: If Windflurry gave 2 extra attacks 20% of the time to two weapons, one slow and one fast, they would end up with the same dps over time (easy to prove mathematically).<br /><br />However, Windflurry not only gives extra attacks but it also adds +665 attack power, which adds a flat amount of damage to each attack. This extra damage will get added more times over time with a fast weapon because WF will proc more.<br /><br />4) Flurry Talent: For enhancement Shaman's that don't care about pvp and big hits, a fast weapon speed is great because of the Flurry talent that give a 30% attack speed increase if we gain a crit. If we strike more often, we're going to get a crit more often and get +30% to attack speed more often. If you compare a slow weapon and a fast weapon that both have a dps of 50, they still have the same dps after Flurry, the only difference is the fast weapon will have this speed increase more often.<br /><br />So in summary, yes the dagger is definitely good for all casters, but it is PERFECT for Shamans and they should be given first priority to get it, especially considering that the other caster weapon alternatives are not that great for Shamans. Non-casters rolling or bidding on this are very stupid and greedy people indeed, especially considering how many high dps daggers and weapons exist now.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Sep 27 17:18:55 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>While this dagger would be a nice addition to a rogues arsenal, or a mage, priest or any other dagger using casters, this dagger wouldn't be utilised or couldn't be utilised better than a shaman could. If your raid doesn't have a shaman then it should go to a druid, no druids? then this dagger should be fair game to any other class that could use it or wants it, otherwise get yer grubby meat paws away from it. I feel a rogue has as much claim to this as a priest/mage, the caster wants it for the stats and the rogue for the dps, both are about an equal claim to wanting this imho.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a rogue and would be embarrased to be seen with this dagger equipped, dps or no. The comparable damage that could be done with this weapon, while providing no special procs is absolutely worthless. I would gurantee you that two felstrikers would do better than one felstriker and this, BECAUSE there is a proc that we could actually use. If I were partied and got this dropped, I would happily pass it to a caster and hope that they get excellent use out of that weapon. DPS isn't everything guys. There are many more factors that affect damage output, and crits are one of them. Rogues rolling on this give the other rogues the stereotype of being immature and greedy, with no thought to anyone else. We aren't all like that. Good luck rolling, casters! I hope to group with you.<br /><br />I reread the post. GG Prosperus. You'd actually think to use this in your main hand? You are an idiot.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just say if you all want the dagger kill the beast 1000's of time wasting 10000's of hours so everyone has the dagger and there's no agruing. I personaly want the dagger eventually but i still got alot to learn about the game im only a 54 shaman and i dont know alot about fighting in raid groups or in high lvl instances. because i dont read but if and when i go fight this dragon in a raid group i will try my best to get the item as fairly as possible if it drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone who said this dagger is best for a Rogue has one of three problems:<br /><br />1 - they cannot read<br />2 - their brain cannot process simple thought patterns<br />3 - they don't have the slightest inkling of how to play their class<br /><br />Firstly, there are AT LEAST 3 daggers in this game that are better backstab/ambush daggers than this one. Yes, it has the highest DPS in the game for a dagger. Does this mean it is the best BS/ambush dagger? NO... What makes a good dagger is the MAXIMUM DAMAGE. So rogues that can actually read and know about other weapons would see that this dagger is not amazing, and honestly, if someone saw a rogue with this dagger equipped they would think you're a total newb.<br /><br />Secondly, the stats of this dagger.. Hmmmm lets see how good they are for a rogue:<br /><br />+1% crit chance with SPELLS: ROGUES YOU DO NOT HAVE SPELLS THIS DOES NOT HELP YOU.<br /><br />+10 Intellect: ROGUES INTEL IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE STAT FOR YOU.<br /><br />+4 mana every 5 secs: ROGUES YOU DO NOT HAVE MANA!<br /><br />So... the only reason a rogue would roll on this is for DPS... well ok i will say you rogues can roll on this if there is NO shamans/druids/priests/mages in the group, good luck killing azuregos without us.<br /><br />Thirdly, read the name. It is called the FANG OF MYSTICS. ARE YOU A MYSTIC? NO. Now please, if you're a rogue and you think you have rolling rights on this dagger you should take your keyboard and shove it up your anus.<br /><br />And warriors... don't even joke about it ;)<br /><br />Yes, life does suck for rogues when fighting azuregos. I'm sorry there are no drops for you. You really should go and kill Kazzak who has the best Rogue neck/gloves/1h mace drops in the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i have never seen such hatred spawned from an item but you know what the first time i see a rogue with this i know more than a few players that are going to /ignore them and that persons entire guild. well thats my 2 cents</div>

While only 1 effect isnt usable for hunters, all 3 are worthless for rogues (+10 intel, Passive effects)<br /><br />Casters obv. first, please dont let me explain that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>is if you're a rogue and even consider this weapon, you need to step back and evaluate your character just a little bit. anyone arguing the point of this being good for rogues is just stupid, i don't CARE what the damage on it is, you're robbing a caster of a weapon they will get the maximum use out of. high dps dagger does not = rogue. take a look at a nice chunk of the daggers and swords in this game, not all of them are made for melee classes. they may have dps, but it is damn clear what type of classes they are for. any melee class or hunter(yes, i say hunter because while they too use mana and need intellect, they don't need these things nearly as much as a mage or warlock do) with a caster weapon is either greedy, stupid or both.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>in a non-pickup raid, there will be rules already for rolling or distrubuting loot. so that depends on your guild or whatever. if I were the loot officer of a guild, I would not restrict this dagger to only casters. however, I would give non-enhancement shamans priority and casters/rogue could roll secondary. if we used DKP I would let anybody except warriors and hunters spend DKP on this (and paladins obviously, they can't even equip a dagger).<br /><br />in a pickup raid, the only people who should be looked down upon (and probably labelled a ninja looter) for rolling on this are the ones who will just vendor it for 10g. a rogue would find a lot of use for this as as offhand dagger (about as good as scarlet kris or bonescraper, though personally I would prefer one of those two even though they're harder to get).<br /><br />on my shaman I would definitely roll for this. it's an endgame shaman weapon. on my rogue I would not roll for it, but only because I like to avoid drama. if it weren't for all the idiots out there, I would DEFINITELY use this on my rogue. on my priest I would not roll if there was a shaman present.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of posts saying this is a rogue-only weapon because of the high end damage and thus is being great for backstab and ambush. they are VERY wrong. this is a terrible backstab/ambush dagger because of the speed and the way attack power bonus works. barman shanker is the best BS/ambush dagger and it's easy to get. next you have ones like heartseeker, felstriker etc. this sucks as a rogue mainhand dagger.<br /><br />I also see a lot of posts saying this is a TERRIBLE rogue weapon and no rogue should use this. they point out that it would be terrible for BS/ambush which is true. you're wrong too, though. this is an endgame OFFHAND rogue dagger because of the speed and dps. your offhand dagger should be as fast as possible to apply more poisons. it should also have good dps.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Apr 17 19:28:17 2005</div>

The fact that there are people slinging mud over rogues rolling on this item (and item that they CAN use should it be better than what they have) are clearly greedier than the rogues they are bashing.

(playable with off hand maybe..ok ^^ ). Why they didn't added this little &quot;Class : Shaman, Warlock, Mage, priest&quot; on it? Why they didn't lowered damages and DPS like they did for that dagger in the chest of the seven (clearly a caster dagger). <br /><br />I'm rogue myself, that thing is interesting in terms of damages (and if i could have Felstriker i wouldn't roll on that one), and i understand that casters may find that interesting too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It all depends on play style. I'm a caster (warlock) and I think this weap would be great for me... quit telling us that we (some casters in general) don't do enough melee fighting to constitute using this: MY play style involves melee. What happens when I'm out of mana? Or the mob gets up close and personal and I can't get a spell off as fast as I can slashing the hell outta it? I fight melee using my dagger and wand. If I can't use some of my spells, you better believe I want to have something kick ass in my hand in order to survive. Not to mention in PvP I can't always stand back and just cast since most PvP or duels are gonna be in close proximity. I do agree that DPS isn't always everything in a weap- the caster stats are nice and I think it's good for a caster, but I have no problems with other classes using this- even rogues or hunters as hunters could use the mana regen as well. It all depends on play style. Just because x class is x type doesn't mean the person playing that class doesn't play it a little differently to suit their style. Shouldn't roll just because it's &quot;OMG UBER!&quot; but should roll if you intend to use it. Quit telling people how to play their class- even if you're of the same class because everyone plays differently. Just because you don't see a use for it the way you play a doesn't mean someone else plays exactly like you and should think like you. They may play differently and put it to good use.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There is no reason whatever build to roll on this if you're a caster, why? The reason for getting this kind of gear is not solo intended but to make sure you have the best possible gear when doing MC/Onyxia.<br />Oh you want this for solo PvP or PvE? YOU GO KILL THE DRAGON YOURSELF!<br /><br />Don't be a selfish bastard and whatever build you may have there is NONE that gives a caster viability for this dagger since your main dps outcome is NOT melee DPS but MAGIC. FFS.<br />This is a pure melee dagger, shaman, warrior, rogue, NOT hunter NOT DRUID since they do dmg with feral NOT daggers. What kind of gimp Hunter requires 1hand melee weap? :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Correct me if I'm wrong but last time I checked, +10 intellect and a chance to get criticals with SPELLS and something that restores MANA sounds like a caster item to me. Yes, it's great for melee fighters too because of DPS, but DPS is not everything. Casters have just as much right to this item as anyone else, especially if they can use it and it's better than the weap they have. A staff is a melee weapon, too, and yet you have no problems with us having THAT kind of melee weapon? As a warlock, my character starts off with a dagger in its hand. Not only is it the first and original melee weap that a warlock knows instinctively (I'd have to go train for staves), but the fang of mystics also has good caster stats. Are there better weaps out there for casters? Sure. Does it mean I have said better item and don't deserve this one? No. Are there weaps out there with better enhancements suited for warriors or rogues? (last time I checked, MANA regen or a better chance for casting cricital SPELLS had no benefit for a warrior or rogue whatsoever) Of course there are, so your logic here is flawed. Just because it has high DPS does not mean that it's not good for a caster type or that a caster can't use it... if that were the case, why would Blizz put caster enhancements on it? And nowhere does this weapon say it's ONLY meant to be used for MC/Onyxia. You're trying to tell me that if you were to get this as a drop that you'd ONLY use it for MC/Onyxia? ROFL riiiiight.<br /><br />Bottom line? If this weap was meant for a few specific classes ONLY, Blizz would have put a restriction on it as such, but that's not the case... so who are you to tell one class they have no right to it over another? If someone finds use in it or planned to use it, they have just as much right as anyone else. Just because you don't agree with someone else's play style doesn't mean they're wrong.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What ever, leave it to melee people to take all the good weapons because they disreguard the fact that a weapon is a caster weapon and not a melee weapon. I love it when warriors think a staff that regenerates 11 mana every 5 seconds is a warrior weapon because it does 63 DPS. There are alot of uneducated poeple who play this game. This is a caster weapon so stop trying to take everything rogues/warriors/paladins. I'm getting sick of the people saying that even though it gives mana per second its a warrior weapon. Stop taking things that arent yours.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Will someone please stop to consider Hunters?<br /><br />Yes i agree we shouldnt get first choice of the weapon but please spare us a thought. Once we hit lvl 30 our mana usage is greatly increased. Not only this but ranged combat is not possible in every situation.<br /><br />The high dps would be great for us as we rely on a high damage output, duel wielding this weapon would be very effective in melee. Agreed, the +1% crit chance on spells is no use to us, however the +10 intelligence would be excellent as it would provide a much needed mana increase, also the mana regen would be very useful for obvious reasons. For a pvping hunter this weapon would be an awesome addition to the rest of their gear. Also it would come in handy in group pve because there are times when a hunter has to stand in and melee. Although our ranged dps is far superior to our melee dps, ranged combat is not always practical in some situations.<br /><br />I personally believe hunters should come before rogues/warriors/palas when considering who should recieve this weapon.<br /><br />Shaman should definitly get first choice/offer of this weapon but please dont disregard the needs of hunters, and remember, a hunter's mana drops at an alarming rate during combat.</div>

No. They are both good, for different situations. <br /><br />Aurastone is a superior healing weapon, no doubt about it. If I'm in MC or healing for an instance, I'd use Aurastone without a second though. <br /><br />However, Fang is great for PVP. Spell crit and 51.7 dps. Cuts through caster armour like nothing else. Procs a lot of windfuries. <br /><br />Same thing for dueling. Against a plate/mail shield wearing opponent, I'll go for the slower weapon because of a higher damage range. Spellcasters, faster weapon with lower damage range.<br /><br />I agree, this dagger is fairly poor for any pure caster class, or any pure melee class. If you look at it, it has obviously been designed with a hybrid in mind. High dps and spell crit? Is there a clearer way of sticking &quot;Hybrid&quot; on it? <br /><br />Saying it is crap is, in essence, very narrow minded.

This game is not geared like EQ, there are lots of viable options. Shaman, Paladin, Druid, Mage, and yes, to a lesser extent, maybe Rogues. Honestly, I'd rather see this go to a f'ing hunter before a rogue, they'd utilize it more then a rogue in my eyes. But, the final decision is up to a guild/raid leader, and this thread so far has proved without a doubt one point I've always held true:<br /><br /><b>Pickup raids are the single stupidest idea in the world of Azeroth.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this dagger does the second most amount of damage in the game for daggers. therefore, it is the best backstab/ambush dagger in the game. there are other daggers that come close at 49-93 like the kel'seris one, but this does, handsdown, the most damage for a dagger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've read this whole first page (yes i'm lazy, and in school, so sue me if someone has written this pre. me) and not one mention thus far about the off-hand equip that CLOTHWEARERS WILL USE, unless extremely crack-skulled or something, together with this dagger. Many of you, presumably, rouges out there are right; +10int ain't all that.. until you stack it with a off-hand item that brings you another +10, and +12stmn, AND +10spr (sometimes more, sometimes less, you get my point). Didn't think of that, now did you?<br /><br />And what do you think we do when we've fought off our fair share off mobs and some more come picking on us, with a mana-pool of exactly 0.5 spell left, do we yell at them in hope of them getting intimidated? Do we kick their kneecaps and hope they get crippled so we can run away? Do we maybe trow dirt in their face to just piss them off? No, we try to melee our sorry ass out of there. How do we do that? Well, certainly not by using a poor piece-of-crap 2.6DPS-dagger gotten on a random-drop at level 3. So, yes, a clothwearer should have a first-priority on this.

I have this and the Aurastone Hammer and the hammer (despite being 44dps instead of 51) does a buttload more damage with windfury on it.<br /><br />Windfury favours slow weapons with high top end damage, which the fang of mystics does not have. Still a great dagger for pvp when you're not doing much melee (spell crit ftw) and just tossing in chain lightnings as well as shocks and heals, but generally... I don't have it equipped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>SHAMANS: WF: The reason you want a slow but high-damage weapon is because you want to deal 3x 500 damage, not 3x 200. The effects of attack power are increased if your weapon speed is longer, and the slower weapons also have higher base DPS. So no, this is NOT a Shaman weapon *IF YOU'RE A WINDFURY BUILD* (or rely on it to any extent).<br /><br />SHAMANS: Non-WF: Crit Shocks and C-L are nice - in PvP or PvE with healing, this is a good weapon choice.<br /><br />DRUIDS/MAGES/WARLOCKS: Crit on Spells is ALL Spells. Includes Healing AND Damage. So Druids, being that they can't wield Swords, should get this over Mages or Warlocks - who can both get Azuresong Mageblade. HOWEVER - being that drop rates for these Epics are as low as they are - any caster who CAN equip this, and wants to, should be allowed to roll if they have the DKP at their disposal.<br /><br />Shadowfang<br />60 Druid, Dragonmaw Server.</div>

BUT, the main hand even if is a bloodrazor, with 120 charges, i can use it up. so, as i said, if u dont know bout rogues, shut ur monitor and go for more simple games such as pacman.<br /><br />let me remind u something, the policy so far in this game for rollin is &quot;if is upgrade, and u can use it, then roll&quot;<br /><br />now who do u think u r to break that rules simply cuz the dagger has attributes that r useless to a rogue? the dps is all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay it seems like alot of people are saying the same things. Let's get some facts out: Warlocks, Mages, Priests - they do not melee. Therefore, the highest DPS dagger in the game is utterly useless for that purpose.<br /><br />DPS is very important for Rogues, Druids and Shaman. This particular dagger has an incredibly high max and minimum damage on it therefore increasing the amount of backstab and ambush damage that occurs (for rogue classes obviously). Not to mention the weapon is faster than Barman's (which allows for more chances to apply poison because you're striking more often).<br /><br />There are numerous staves and other weapons for casters that are better than this weapon. Think about how broken this dagger would have been if it was speced for a rogue. The majority of daggers I see people using like the Darrowspike have horrible proc abilities - the reason people use those daggers are for the DPS, not the proc abilities, so stop telling rogues the crappy abilities on this dagger matter.<br /><br />In the end, if a cloth wearer were to roll on this dagger, I would shoot them for being so stupid. You can find better weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hey you dumb @#$%ers. This is just as much a rogue dagger as it is anything else. You casters need to stop @#$%ting your pants over this. that mana regen is total crap, and you know it. the Intel bonus on this will not beat the stats you can get on a 2h staff, not to mention there are no caster enchants for 1h weapons. and 1% chance to crit? OMFG! HOW AMAZING! yeah. you spells will crit once out of a hundered times more often than they did before with this dagger. So that means it MUST be worth more to any of you than to a rogue who will be doing 10 DPS more than what they could with the best blue item. and don't give me this &amp;*!@ about other weapons in MC being better for rogues, cause not everyone that plays this game is going to play MC for three days for a slim to none chance at a comparable weapon. And barman shanker? %^&amp;* that POS. DOTs are the last thing any smart rogue would want on a dagger, because it breaks gouge, and if you don't know why that's important, you're too stupid/uninformed to be debating this. so all you 12 year olds need to %^&amp;*ing calm down, since you're not smart enough to know what stats do for your class.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />I don't know how the abilities for paladins and shaman work with DPS verse actual damage, so I can't say I have an opinion about them rolling on this. However, druids using a 1h weapon for the dps? that's idiotic. Druids can't dual wield, and they can't hold shields. So they need to keep their paws off as well. <br /><br />My ruling: this is a shaman/rogue dagger, nothing else.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Mar 30 05:47:00 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I really want to be rude, it would actually follow the tone of most<br />post in this thread but I won't.<br /><br />Here are the basic facts as to what are the best rogue daggers and<br />this one dagger is not part of them.<br /><br />Based on the rogue FAQ located here:<br /><a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-rogue&amp;t=7&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post7" rel="nofollow">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-rogue&amp;t=7&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post7</a><br /><br />You get per strike a your dps attack power bonus. Since the weapon<br />speed doesn't affect the frequency at which you can sinister strike or<br />backstab, you end up having the dps bonus from attack power MULTIPLIED<br />by the speed of the weapon.<br /><br />Basically if you have a 1.5 speed weapon, you will get 1.5 times the<br />DPS bonus from your attack power added to the base damage of the<br />strike and possibly multiplied by some other factor like 1.5 (or 20%<br />more with opportunity) from backstab or even 2.5 from ambush.<br /><br />Now if we're talking about a 2.0 speed weapon, you get your attack<br />power bonus multiplied by two which is better. Now it is to evaluate<br />is it more interesting to have a faster weapon but much higher base<br />dps or a slower weapon with even lower dps to get that big bonus from<br />attack power.<br /><br />The answer is to get the slowest weapon the possible as some level 60s<br />can have anywhere between 450-650 attack power accounting for some<br />30-45dps bonus from attack power. Resulting in 45 base damage weapon<br />for a 1.5 speed weapon or 60 base damage weapon for a 2.0 speed<br />weapon. Now I'm telling you one thing. That's 15 base damage more, 3<br />times the best enchant you can get (for straight dmg enchant) and that<br />15 damage can be multiplied by some other factor. It can be even more<br />the higher the attack power you get.<br /><br />Now that weapon has the same base damage as the Felstriker but is a<br />worse weapon because felstriker is slower... which is better.<br /><br />The following are all better dagger for backstabing/ambushing/sinister<br />striking than Fang of the Mystics:<br /><br />Barman Shanker<br />Felstriker (only the proc itself makes it better than Barman Shanker)<br />Gutgore Ripper (best atm: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=36280">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=36280</a>)<br /><br />Even better than Gutgore Ripper accounting for weapon speed alone is<br />the newly to come dagger off the PvP System in next patch:<br />The Grand Marshall's Dirk:<br /><a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/images/honor-system/ssweapons.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/images/honor-system/ssweapons.jpg</a><br /><br />What saddens me the most is some of the very rude reply by some of you<br />guys, that sadly hadn't read the fact and unfortunately didn't know<br />what they were talking about.<br /><br />Now I'm telling you one thing, Fang of the Mystics will indeed strike<br />33% more often than barman shanker, but your chance to proc a poison<br />is 30%, so basically your damage ouput from poison overall from the<br />main hand will be increased by 10%, and much less than that if you<br />take into account the number of proc from SS and from off-hand... that<br />gain in damage is meaningless compared to the gain in damage from the<br />base damage bonus from attack power each sinister<br />strike/backstab/ambush. End of the story.<br /><br />That dagger for rogue is at best a good off-hand weapon but the mods<br />on distracting dagger makes it better and easier to get. It's a godly<br />weapon for a shaman.<br /><br />Don't roll on it if your a rogue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>RacialCreamer/Snake, I really wish I was on your server just so I could roll on felstriker just cuz i can use it. You're a noob. This really isn't that Godly for a rogue as you are so desperately trying to say. If I were leading a raid and this dagger dropped mage/priest/warlock/druid/(shaman if I were horde) would roll on it. That's it. If every caster passed on it for whatever reason, Rogues AND Hunters would be allowed to roll.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Curse blizz for making a dagger high dps and have mana regen/spell crit %.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK, I see all this math and talk about &gt; for this and &gt; then that.<br /><br />Stop arguing, look at the dagger.<br /><br />+10 Int<br />+1% Crit with a spell<br />+restores 4 mana every 5 seconds.<br /><br />We can all do a %^&amp;* load of math for whatever reason we think that it's better for this class or that. But read those stats right there.<br />3/4 of the stats on that dagger (other then DPS)are suited for a caster.<br /><br />As A Mage, I's &amp;*!@ a brick If I got the Drop. +10 Int aswell as 4 mana every 5 secs and to boot a +1% chance to crit. Im a mainly frost spec mage and Like the lock mentioned earlier, we have effects and talents that allow crit chance to be increased already, then you add +1% to you weapon aswell that's a VERY good stat to have on your weapon. Sure the DPS is higher, but in all fairness, gimme a *!@#in break, That is clearly a dagger meant for a caster, and if A rogue roled on it, then he's a noob for not looking at stats that matter to others aswell, and he's a douchbag for being a pric to roll on a dagger that he will only get DPS out of. If you think im wrong then blow me, cause the guys that posted here that a rogues and have stuck up for it being a caster dagger cleary have more common sense then you, and i'd say by the sound of it know alot more about their class then you do. I asked around on my realm to some good rogues and asked if they would roll on this, Most of them said, &quot;Ya if there wasnt a caster there that needed it or could use it.&quot;<br /><br />This is a dumb argument</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After much deliberation I have come up with official order for distribution of the dagger. It is unfortunate that Blizzard made such a weapon but have crated this situation. Failure to follow this order makes you scum:).<br /><br />1. Rogues/Shaman. It is pretty much a tossup here both benefit from the dps quite a bit with the rogue getting the most bang for the buck from the dps, but the shaman actually can use the mana and critical strike and int. Technically the shaman maybe should win out here perhaps because the bonuses arent wasted on a hybrid caster.<br />2. Warriors benefit from the dps though not as much key to their role as the above. But, increased damage = increased aggro so yeah there is some good group friendly reasons to justify a tank with this.<br />3. other Magic users. The mana and int and such are nice but really be honest you can do as well or better with other items that arent dps. <br /><br />So there you have it other than the Shaman vs Rogue issue it is very clear the way you must distribute this item unless you want to be a punk:). jk.</div>

NOW BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING, i'm using gutgore mainhand and this offhand. The only reason i received this weapon is because the person who wanted it wasn't eligible to receive it, and no one else on the raid wanted it. We don't ROLL, we use a DKP system. I couldn't let a 51.7 dps offhand be turned into shards, so i said yes. I have a bonescraper for offhand as well, and the loss of 30 AP is eh, it's 2 dmg off my top end (which is now only 225 wah wah). I agree that this is by NO MEANS WHATSOEVER a dagger for rogues, but if IF NO ONE ELSE ON THE RAID wants it, grab it for offhand. The only better offhand is a core hound tooth, good luck scoring the lowest drop rate item from majordomo. <br /><br />Just to remind you, i only took this because the person who wanted it wasn't eligible, and no one else wanted it. I did not roll on this, i simply spoke up before it was disenchanted. and YES, it is a good offhand for rogues. If you have lousy gear though, stick with a bonescraper.</div>

Get a Quel'dorai Channeling Rod. Or a Lorespinner. Or just for mana, a Trindlehaven, Brightwood, gift of the Elven Magi, or Argent Crusader.<br /><br />Aside from that, this has about 60 mana over an Inventor's Focal Sword, which doesn't exactly take a 40-man raid of a rare world boss to get.<br /><br />As far as the 1% crit goes, get a rod of the ogre magi. <br /><br />There are many easy to get blues as good or better than this dagger. <br /><br />Hunter: get a dawn's edge with 15 agility. 1% physical crit should do a whole lot more good than a 1% spell crit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's absolutely incredible that any cloth wearer would call a rogue &quot;greedy&quot; for wanting to use this dagger. There is exactly ONE dagger in the entire game currently that is comparable to this for a Rogue, and that's the &quot;Felstriker&quot;. Claims that &quot;extra agility on your class-specific dagger make up for the lack of DPS&quot; are completely ridiculous, as daggers with the highest agility, like Widowmaker, only add a total of 15 attack power. 15 attack power results in maybe one more displayed DPS, whereas this dagger is going to boost your damage output substantially with either hand. The mods are totally irrelevant in this calculation, all that matters is the bottom line: min/max damage, and overall DPS. As for people who might claim &quot;but it has obvious caster mods, and is therefore better for a cloth wearer&quot;, I ask this question: since when does a cloth wearer melee anything above like level 30? That's right, you don't, you do all your damage with spells. Which means that the 51.7 DPS is irrelevant, and that you're essentially using an item that gives +10 intellect, about +5 spirit, and 1% extra chance to crit with spells.<br /><br />And if you think that that 1% extra crit chance is important, let me put it into prespective. Let's say you're an Arcane Mage, and you use Arcane Missles as your primary damage dealer. At level 60, a barrage of five missles inflicts 192 * 5 damage, or 960 total damage. If you crit with your spell, assume that it's doing 960 * 1.5 = 1440 damage. That's a grand total difference of 480 damage, which you now inflict 1% more often because of the dagger. 1% of 480 = 4.8 damage, so this dagger is adding an average of 4.8 damage per volley to your Arcane Missles. If there was a dagger that did 5-10 damage(it might as well since you don't melee), had +10 Intellect, +5 spirit, and said &quot;+4.8 Arcane Damage&quot; would you be arguing that it's totally uber for your class? I truly doubt it. <br /><br />So that should be the end of the argument: Fang of the Mystics MASSIVELY increases the DPS of any dagger-using rogue, it is matched only by Felstriker, and it is considerably worse than many green items for a cloth wearer. If you roll for this as a Priest, Mage or Warlock with a &quot;N&quot; rogue in your group, YOU are the greedy bastard.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Mar 26 16:26:09 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon is not meant for a rogue and I hope this discussion stop. Most likely that weapon is mostly designed for a Shaman due to high-end damage and the int buff. But this is clearly not meant for a rogue.<br /><br />Let me point your to the rogue faq located here:<br /><br /><a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-rogue&amp;t=7&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post7" rel="nofollow">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-rogue&amp;t=7&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post7</a><br /><br />And quote some text:<br /><br />Weapon #1: <br />20 average damage, 1.00 speed = 20 dps <br />+20 average damage = 40 average damage, 40 dps <br /><br />Now let's say you have another weapon which is 20 dps, but 2.00 speed. So, it's average damage per swing is 40. For this particular weapon, 20 dps = 40 damage per hit. So in this case, your average damage will go up 40 damage points due to your attack power bonus. <br /><br />Weapon #2: <br />40 average damage, 2.00 speed = 20 dps <br />+40 average damage = 80 average damage, 40 dps. <br /><br />Both weapon #1 and #2 have the same DPS, but weapon #2 is a much better mainhand weapon. Obviously there are no 1.00 speed weapons, but the point still holds. <br /><br />All this explains why, for instance, the Toxic Revenger ends up having a slightly higher damage range than the Black Menace. Black Menace has an average damage of 44.5 @ 1.5s. Toxic Revenger, on the other hand, has an average damage of 39 @ 1.9s. The Black Menace has a much higher DPS, but since the average damages are so close, you'll notice that your tooltip damage range will be slightly higher with the Revenger, assuming you have a reasonable attack power. <br /><br />Now the amount of damage you would gain off poison by chosing a weapon twice as fast is probably ridiculously low compared to the instant damage gained from Sinister Strikes or bstab ambush.<br /><br />I'm astonished to see that some people think they know !@#$ because they don't use the blizzard forums... although there's some very good and worthwhile information.<br /><br />Those probably are the same person picking Vile Poisons talent instead of improved isntant poison.</div>

Last time I checked 100 intellect = 1500 mana, and that's a lot more important than 1% extra crit chance.

FOOL. And then because your such a greedy dipstick you roll on it for the sole purpose of the increased DPS which any caster who can wield daggers has a right to, moreso over you. I think not.<br /><br />Rogue by class, rogue by nature. If a rogue rolled on this in my presence (mage), I'd hunt them down and make sure they never got a minute's rest.<br /><br />Shamans also do have a right to this dagger but not more than other casters. It depends how the person plays their caster and if they melee a fair bit. When you run out of mana its either a slow wand or this fast increased DPS dagger. You choose.</div>

Holy crap man, Fang of the Mystics lets you cast almost FIVE extra arcane missles PER HOUR! How unbelievably UBER! <br /><br />So there you have it: one good caster mod, one mediocre caster mod, and one nearly worthless caster mod stacked up against the best DPS dagger in the game by almost 6. They're hardly equal, and this dagger's single good rogue mod completely outstrips the other three caster mods. I'm not using math to justify avarice, I'm using math to explain reality. A lot of the people who commented in this thread are in dire need of a strong dose of that.<br /><br />P.S. If you read my original post, you'll see that I only condemmed &quot;cloth wearers&quot; rolling on the dagger. That means Priest, Mage and Warlock. Druids and Shamans can definitely benefit from the dagger's insane DPS, and I think that they're completely entitled to roll on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon is not meant for a rogue and I hope this discussion stop. Most likely that weapon is mostly designed for a Shaman due to high-end damage and the int buff. But this is clearly not meant for a rogue.<br /><br />Let me point your to the rogue faq located here:<br /><br /><a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-rogue&amp;t=7&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post7" rel="nofollow">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-rogue&amp;t=7&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post7</a><br /><br />And quote some text:<br /><br />Weapon #1: <br />20 average damage, 1.00 speed = 20 dps <br />+20 average damage = 40 average damage, 40 dps <br /><br />Now let's say you have another weapon which is 20 dps, but 2.00 speed. So, it's average damage per swing is 40. For this particular weapon, 20 dps = 40 damage per hit. So in this case, your average damage will go up 40 damage points due to your attack power bonus. <br /><br />Weapon #2: <br />40 average damage, 2.00 speed = 20 dps <br />+40 average damage = 80 average damage, 40 dps. <br /><br />Both weapon #1 and #2 have the same DPS, but weapon #2 is a much better mainhand weapon. Obviously there are no 1.00 speed weapons, but the point still holds. <br /><br />All this explains why, for instance, the Toxic Revenger ends up having a slightly higher damage range than the Black Menace. Black Menace has an average damage of 44.5 @ 1.5s. Toxic Revenger, on the other hand, has an average damage of 39 @ 1.9s. The Black Menace has a much higher DPS, but since the average damages are so close, you'll notice that your tooltip damage range will be slightly higher with the Revenger, assuming you have a reasonable attack power. <br /><br />Now the amount of damage you would gain off poison by chosing a weapon twice as fast is probably ridiculously low compared to the instant damage gained from Sinister Strikes or bstab ambush.<br /><br />I'm astonished to see that some people think they know @#$% because they don't use the blizzard forums... although there's some very good and worthwhile information.<br /><br />Those probably are the same person picking Vile Poisons talent instead of improved isntant poison.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I used to be saving points for this dagger, but now (1.10), the 50+ dps is gone and it's just another caster dagger. A pretty awesome caster dagger, but its no longer unique... oh well.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Apr 1 14:46:22 2006</div>
