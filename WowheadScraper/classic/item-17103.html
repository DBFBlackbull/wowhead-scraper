Some of you will argue that since Paladins will only use it some of the time, it should NOT go to them.  Unfortunately, since Paladins need multiple weapons, this argument would pretty much preclude them from getting ANY good weapon, such as Quel'Serrar (Warrior), Aurastone (Druid\/Priest), Finkle's (Druid), or OEB (Warrior, Rogue) since another class will use it more.  This is hardly fair, but at the same time Pallies should not be getting 3 epics for everyone else's 1 (or 2 for the offhand) epics...that's where DKP comes in.\n\nBTW for anyone who suggests that Paladins should use Finkle's instead: Finkle's is NOT necessarily a great Pally healing weapon for a place like Molten Core, though it is probably very good for any instance before that.  For a Paladin to be at his best healing\/casting, unless he is seriously geared-up he is better off switching plate items for some mail, leather, and cloth.  This is not a big problem AS LONG AS HE HAS A SHIELD.  Otherwise he is just as fragile as a Priest but cannot heal as well.  With a shield at least he might survive long enough to actually do something if he gets any aggro, such as surviving a Surger's charge when his health has already dropped a bit.\n\nSo I would give Mages and Warlocks priority on the Azuresong, but I don't think it's ridiculous for a Paladin to want it, nor is it ridiculous for a guild to let a Paladin spend his DKP in order to get it.","date":"2005-09-09T20:54:40-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"roundhead","importedSubject":"Warlocks and Mages first, but good for Pallies"},{"commentv2":1,"number":45,"id":3060494,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I got this a few weeks ago.

If you STILL dont see it ill explain it for you. The primary stats are...... Stam and Int........\n\nFact: Paladins are possibly the most mana efficent healers in the game. Given our illumination talent  and high spell crit we can heal virtually non stop. This talent combined with a high ammount of \"+x mana every 5 seonds regenerated\" gear makes us very effective and very powerfull healers.\n\nAnyone that looks at the available paladin loot KNOWS that it is nearly impossible for us to get + spell crit gear. Blizzard did this for a reason, to keep us from becoming overpowered. Mages and other cloth users on the other hand have nearly endless options for + spell crit gear. Thus making the Azuresong Mageblade a VERY VERY desirable loot for paladins.\n\nThat being said. I am not arguing that is clearly a paladin ONLY loot, im saying it is as much a paladin loot as it is a mage or warlock loot. You shouldnt grief people that know their class and know what loots will benifit them most. After all, theyre in your guild, shouldnt you trust them? And if you dont, why are they in the guild?\n\nEdited, Thu Aug 18 16:17:45 2005","date":"2005-08-18T20:04:13-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"It's posts like these that make me glad I play Horde... notice the number of posts made by this guy too...","creationdate":"2005-09-21T16:19:17-05:00","id":1277629,"rating":0,"commentid":3060510,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"pezjono","importedSubject":"RE: Azuresong Mageblade"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Shivveh","importedSubject":"Azuresong Mageblade"},{"commentv2":1,"number":62,"id":3060511,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Ok, well first of all its called a MAGEblade.

Pull multiple mobs, use a complicated strat, or Burn your mana as a handicap? For instance one consect I have been think ing about is rotating aggro between dps. DPS starts one at a time one at a time staggarded. Then in order you turn dps off in a rotation so the boss runs back and forth between the dps. Is this a practical thing to do?

I am used to heal between fighting and there is Azuresong definitely only variant till my raid community manage to kill Nefarian and I get in hand Lok'Amir il Romathis. \n\nThose who do not get it yet and mumbless in their madness something about paladin healing only, notice we can tank and do damage as well, even these roles are less accepted. Tanking paladin is probably weakest of our roles at the moment, what can change with Burning Crusade. Healing paladins land always before all other healing classes in healing charts. Retribution paladin when properly played do insane damage and will position himself just under rogues even between them in damage tables. Face it and take it. If not, go on horde side or roll paladin to find yourself how it works, however stop speaking about things you do not know or understand.\n\nBut back to the topic. You are paladin and got this weapon. What now? Of course, make it even better as it is. What enchants come potentialy in question for this blade? +55 healing, +30 spellpower and +22 intellect. Which one is the best? Depends a lot on what exactly you do with your paladin. For our decision lets consider 5 minutes long fight what would be good average for MC and BWL, flash heals around 700HPs that crit for 1000. In 5 minutes you produce stream of 200 flash heals.\n\n+22 intellect, insane enchant from greedy dwarves. It makes your mana pool higher for, let be generous, 3 flash heals and you will in 5minutes healing without pause get 1 critical free heal from it, what comes to 3100 healed HPs more.\n\n+55 healing. In 5mins fight sitting on main tank streaming in him flash heals you will produce 200 flash heals. Each your flash heal gets a fix bonus from this enchant of 23 HPs. Giving you bonus healing of 4600 HPs.\n\n+30 spell power is tricky. Your spells get fixed bonus of 12 HPs and in 200 casts per fight you will heal or damage 2400 HPs. However if you are fighting, you get some bonus on your seals as well, making it even higher and I would say you will top 3000 HPs. \n\nWhich one you want to take now? Depends on you. As I like to fight while healing and my sword is used whole time out of raid as well, I take spell power that is great allrounder. If you want only heal, go for +healing but then you should consider farming of Jin'do's Hexxer more. +22 intellect is well a garbage for us.","date":"2006-10-01T07:30:36-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Personally, I prefer the +22int as it not only affects the healing capacity, but also the capacity in all other rolls of a paladin.\n\nIf you're a pure healadin and manage to get this weapon off a mage\/lock, +55 healing would be best.

You have no idea how hard it was for me not to fill this post with cuss words at you morons posting that BS argument about \"wasting the healing power.\" Find me anything that says \"increases damage by spells and effects by ##.\" Guess what? You won't find one. Why?

I ended up picking up a Staff of Dominance since a lot of the warlocks wanted this.<br /><br />This is a solid main hand until you get into AQ for all casters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6225</b></h3>This item is ideal for Mages and Warlocks. I, being a mage, got it and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />Enchant it with +30 spell damage, and with a good offhand such as the one from Moam, you're gonna keep it either till Neffy (where you get staff of blackrock power) or AQ40.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3118</b></h3>Having played as a mage, warrior, and priest in formal raids I truely encourage every guild to view this as a pally/mage/lock item. <br /><br />Paladins will be standing when all the other healers have been killed, and when push comes to shove, you want them to be getting free heals. If I were a pally receiving it, I would keep a fast weapon around as well. Ideally one with MP/5. Wisdom returns (both seal on you and on mobs) favor fast weapons. WTS DW to Paladins, aye boys?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7382</b></h3>With the new patch comes the ability to aquire very good gear by relatively easy manners. The Azuresong may be eclipsed as the HWL gear is now easily accessible, and has much better stats. Currenty it's what I'm going for, the HWL Spell blade, but if your guild is still running MC and this drops, I'd so go for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8403</b></h3>Just got this about 2 weeks ago. I, as a mage, prefer this over the staff. If you can get your hands on a nice off-hand, such as jin'do's bag of whammies, you can push your damage even higher than if you went for the staff.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jivitz</b></h3>This is the first great one hander for dps casters. I would personally use this over the Claw of Cromaggus due to the Crit and not much of an increase in dmg. I used this sword until I received a Wraith Blade and would not have done it any other way. One handers and an offhand has much more potential dps rather than stats for mages because mages thrive on burst dps and crits. Staves has potentially the same amount of +damage as the one hander in its tier but has much more stats which is nice for an larger mana pool but the dps won't be as high.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9590</b></h3>I think this is better for a mage thats in MC and working through BWL. Bloodcaller seems to be better for a warlock because of the better +stamina.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9722</b></h3>This is a great caster sword, I use the Mageblade + AV offhand. With the recent patch though, The GM caster dagger is easy to get, It is better than the mageblade in terms of damage but cannot compare in looks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9296</b></h3>Good for pallys, w/ 30 Spell Damage and Healing this is great for healing, soloing and tanking, although it is just as well used on a caster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>of course mages and warlocks should get priority, but a pally should get a chance after them if by chance they all have one or don't want it. people need to live with the fact that yes, there are some pallies in this game built to HEAL and having a weapon like that would be very nice for them. of course like i said, mages and warlocks first because they would get the most use out of it, but don't bash a pally if they want this because it is in fact not half bad for them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yes, they should leave this alone, they get epic sword, we as mage/warlock get no epic weapon at all. when my points get up, this is what i will be after, the other post is right about the staff being a waste because once you combine this with an offhand they will equal higher stats. you also have to look at how much easier it is to get. priests, mages, warlocks, and druids can use staves, but ONLY mages and warlocks can use swords, so much smaller list of people to compete agaisnt. if staff drops i wouldnt waste my points on it, would wait for mageblade. i think paladins should get the 2h mace for healing.--&gt;<a href="/classic/item=18803/hyperthermically-insulated-lava-dredger">Hyperthermically Insulated Lava Dredger</a> the other post about +crit not working for heals is wrong and stupid, +crit works for ALL direct spells, dmg or otherwise. but it would be unwise to rely on crit to save peoples life, any tank would just rather you have a bigger mana pool, or +heal. but it doesnt matter very much since priests/druids cant use swords.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Sep 2 02:33:34 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yeh fair enough mages and locks obviously arent healers, but +Dmg and healing is still useful it affects how much you heal your pet how much your healthstone will heal you etc so yes a warlock would get use of both dmg and healing and yes it wouldnt be as often with the healing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have this on my paladin, was second in the guild to get it.<br /><br />I love being holy spec, for both raiding and PvP, i find it way more fun then retri.<br /><br />I'm ALWAYS useing a 1h and a shield. Prior to this I used mind carver / garret family crest.<br /><br />Now I use azuresong / ZG pally shield.<br /><br />The reason I decided to take azuresong above aurastone / finkles / jindos etc. Is because of the combination of damage/healing here. I often do PvP, so the +40 dmg helps out my damage spells yet helps my healing at the same time.<br />Keep in mind too, our illumination ability, allows us to cast free heals if they crit. If a heal crits, we get all the mana back from that heal, therefore why I prefer azuresong which also has the 1% chance crit that aurastone doesnt.<br />For me, I put a +22 intellect on it, that way i get extra mana for healing in raiding, + i get it for boosting spell critical for PvP and my mana pool for PvP<br /><br />However, I agree that if a pally just plans to heal in raids and not do PvP or anything, Jindo's mace is better for healing than this, or finkles for that matter.</div>

They will use it only during MC or BWL whereas this is THE endgame weapon for both mages and warlocks.<br /><br />Oh and by the way...the fact that most Pallys carry around TUF and Arc Reapers doesn't help your arguement in regards to what your class finds &quot;most important.&quot; You're just being greedy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if it was a dagger then shammies would start to claim it (as those can use daggers but not swords), and if this was a staff it would truly suck ... if we want a staff we got staff of dominance that drops from the same boss, this item is just ownz the staff of dominance combined with a good off hand though (fire runed grimoire is one of them)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am speaking here on the basis of a lvl 60, fully arcanist n some NWs....

Lok amir il' romathis? yeah, this is definately BETTER than mageblade, but this sweety drops from Neffie.<br />3 : they have more weapon assortments than us ? : to hordies.. please stop... paladin CANNOT use DAGGERS, STAVES, Look at dagger n staves, fang of venoxxis, sorcerous dagger, claw of chrommy ( better than this sweety, n it dropped for us ), SoD, stave of the acolyte or some ( name from AQ stave with that huge +76 dmg/healing, 2% chance to hit or so ... ). Can they poor paldins TOUCH them? NO!<br />4 : we mages/locks use this better than them ? The answer is TOTAL NO. out of the 5 stats, we mages n locks use THREE of 5, int, stamina n + dmg. THEY use all 5 ( int, stamina, +dmg, +healing, WEAPON DAMAGE ). In fights of phase 1 Neffie, where the mobs rushes from the 2 doors, paladin WILL use CONCENCRATE ( +dmg is good here while we aoe them to death or kite train them ). hammer wrath is good in vael fight, WHEN they got the BA. As for normal weapon dmg, i SELDOMLY saw a lock/ mage goes berserk n melee.... but as for paladin, well.. its THEIR job.<br />5 : learn to be a cleanser? They heal, they DPS great in the UPCOMING Naxxtramas instance ( UNDEAD, where their DPS IS HUGE . I hated when mainstream class like mages always want EVERYTHING from hybrid class. I have lvl 60 paladin also, n i know the feeling when paladins cannot roll on ANYTHING rather than the 26 items that have class name : class : paladin ( lawbringer, judgement, ZG n AQ set ). Thats y i like my mage's BWL guild where paladins are not forgotten. my paly 60's guild is just mess, paladins are totally forgotten, n it HURTS a lot.<br /><br />As a side note, its THEIR hard earned DKP, so, they are free to roll on ANYTHING they want.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a rogue, I know the agony of the &quot;My class's secondary roll can make use of that, so It should be just as available to me as to you.&quot; Mages, Locks, and Rogues are like brothers, because we all know the worst pain in WoW: losing items that would help us better fill our ONLY roll in the whole game to people who want to accomplish a secondary function.<br /><br />Yes, Mageblade is good for paladins, since in addition to boosting heals it can boost DPS, too. This is a SECONDARY function, though. Mages don't have the option of doing anything other than DPS. Neither do warlocks. If a mage or a warlock needs this, other classes should at LEAST have to pay some extra sum of DKP, to discourage them from bidding or make it very costly if they take it anyway.<br /><br />Whenever bidding something, try to remember if that item inbenefits your classes PRIMARY focus more than the people you're bidding against. No one's saying this isn't good for a pally, it just does the mage more good for his class. Pallies that want to be holy DPSadins (like the one I plan for expansion) should be OK with taking backseat and waiting for this or similar spell damage items until no one who's primary class roll would benefit from it is present.<br /><br />Also, my rogue has this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Come on every single paladin couldn't have made their post with a straight face. If you are talking about 44 dps as the best stat on this sword then you have no reason to roll on it... Clearly the best stat is spell crit. There is only the focal sword and it is still used by 60 casters for spell crit. This is the freaking end game weapon for frost mages and destruction locks. <b>Why do you think warlocks conjure offhands with 1% spell crit</b>. Get a clue. Anyways if the quel serrar book drops for you paladins I hope a caster doesn't outroll you and sell it in front of your face in Ironforge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Personally, as a Paladin, if that sword drops, and I can get it, I'd snap it up. More int=more mana. Obvious, right? Not to some people. More mana means more cleansing/healing in molten core, which is the paladin's primary duty there. I am actively going out there and looking for high int plate(and I'm taking a hard look at other armor types too), just because I need more mana to keep up the debuff removal during those long boss fights. This is a Paladin sword. Yes it's a Mage/Warlock sword too, but to me, this is a Paladin sword.</div>

So, should Golemagg stop dropping Staff Of Dominance and drop an Azuresong i will have a high chance of getting it =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is infact a good sword for paladin. I am sure it is for a mage/lock aswell, but I assure you, it works well for a paladin. As some intellegent soul above pointed out, paladins are used as healers when closing in on end-game instances. When I am in MC, I never hit one single mob.. Im on healing dps grp and cleanse patrol...<br /><br />to the one who commented on the use of Fincke: STFU: You try and use 2 hander in MC when being a healer..<br /><br />All you who says pallys should get Quel: STFU: As I said, pallys are healers.. and whelp control for that matter.. point is, we need SPI/INT. The +% crit is awesome as the heals will get 'refunded' in mana.<br /><br />This is one of the best pala/MC 1h Ive seen, in addition to aurastone.. Let all Paladins/mages and warlocks bid !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This sword should probably go to Mages and Warlocks first, but it really is a very good weapon for Paladins.<br /><br />In my experience, Paladins need 3 weapons to perform at their peak:<br /><br />a) 2H very slow with max DPS<br />b) 1H very fast with some DPS for ultimate lasting power<br />c) 1H healing/casting for PvE instances with some DPS<br /><br />Clearly this is a type C weapon for Paladins. Some of you will argue that since Paladins will only use it some of the time, it should NOT go to them. Unfortunately, since Paladins need multiple weapons, this argument would pretty much preclude them from getting ANY good weapon, such as Quel'Serrar (Warrior), Aurastone (Druid/Priest), Finkle's (Druid), or OEB (Warrior, Rogue) since another class will use it more. This is hardly fair, but at the same time Pallies should not be getting 3 epics for everyone else's 1 (or 2 for the offhand) epics...that's where DKP comes in.<br /><br />BTW for anyone who suggests that Paladins should use Finkle's instead: Finkle's is NOT necessarily a great Pally healing weapon for a place like Molten Core, though it is probably very good for any instance before that. For a Paladin to be at his best healing/casting, unless he is seriously geared-up he is better off switching plate items for some mail, leather, and cloth. This is not a big problem AS LONG AS HE HAS A SHIELD. Otherwise he is just as fragile as a Priest but cannot heal as well. With a shield at least he might survive long enough to actually do something if he gets any aggro, such as surviving a Surger's charge when his health has already dropped a bit.<br /><br />So I would give Mages and Warlocks priority on the Azuresong, but I don't think it's ridiculous for a Paladin to want it, nor is it ridiculous for a guild to let a Paladin spend his DKP in order to get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this a few weeks ago. I'm a paladin, as far as i know the second paladin on my server to get one. Dependant on what a paladin wants, ex: +healing, %crit, mana regen, this was the best 1h weapon for me. It has more +healing than an aurastone, and can be used with a good shield (malistars or dragonscale) to make it better than a lavadredger. Of course, all the mages on my server hate me now, but its all good!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So mages/locks can use this...well duh. But lets see why I (lvl 60 paladin) has this and not the aurastone.<br />This sword had more +healing and with all the +crit I have it gives me more mana then the aurastone.<br />+40 dmg is a lot for mages/locks so it's a very good weapon for them.<br />Lets not argue about this. It's a mage/warlock/paladin weapon. Mages and Locks should accept it that there is an other class bidding at this.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>with the upcoming patch, holy paladins will have a huge upgrade! in order to play it properly, they need +dmg/healing, int/sta/spi and some agi.<br />from what ive heard and seen, the best way to use the new advantages is to use a 1h+shield, and in that way, azuresong mageblade is probably one of the top 3 choices!<br />so however you may hate this, now its just aswell a pala pve as a pvp sword and will be used to its full potential<br />PS: i just got myself a bloodcaller yesterday as a placeholder till i get this lil beauty ;P<br />just my 3 cts ¬_¬</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i personally would have opted for aurastone when i played my pally still, simply for the mana regen which is essential in mc, and the +healing is also nice, but on my lock mageblade is preferrable would go nice with my fire runed grimoire that i got from golemagg last week, but i can say that i would be happy for this to go to a pally unless they had aurastone hammer already, priests and druids could also make use of this but tbh benediction/anathema far far outdoes this as for druids same goes this would suit them well but like someone says finkles lava dredger would rock for them but they dont have to get it maybe they want a nice offhand +healing thing etc, finkles would also suit a paladin. so lets not fight over who can and cant roll, its not like were talking about a warrior having this or a hunter, now if they were that would be just out of order and u would deserve to die lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I did a little bit of maths based on my paladin's current gear (of note, 6/8 LB, mageblade, hoodoo stick, insightful hood - all up about 277 +heal, 5% +spellcrit, 31 +mp5) and the 1% spellcrit that my mageblade gives works out to be around 11 +heal and 5.6 +mp5 from a holy and around 5.6 +heal and 1.4 +mp5 on a flash heal. Keep in mind that, while the mana regen will stay the same, the +heal equivalent is going to ramp up with your gear.<br /><br />In that respect, then yes Jin'do's Hexxer is a better healing mace. The mageblade, however, is a better match to the stats given on Judgement, and the slight reduction in healing power seems in line with the usual reductions when going from straight heal to heal/dmg gear.<br /><br />The biggest problem for me is which enchant to throw onto it.</div>

I'll bet you think Paladins shouldn't bid on it either. Don't get me wrong, i have no problem with someone bidding against me or even outbidding me, Gratz to them, but to be screamed at for bidding at all is a bit ridiculous considering it would do good for us as well. By your Logic something has to say &quot;Paladin&quot; or &quot;Paladinic&quot; in the title to roll on it. What's next? Paladins shouldn't bid on shields cuz there are warriors there? or Warriors and Rogues can't bid on a Bow or Gun cuz there is a Hunter there?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Now, im not saying that this is a warlock only weapon, but just giving ym opinion on why warlocks shoudl pick this up. As some have stated, it would greatly increase the dmg, due to warlocks have the Ruin ability. And to Dasim, Warlocks heal...They have Drain life, and Siphon life...both of which are healing and shadow spells, so it goes either way on it. Having this sword or Fang of teh Mystics is a great weapon to have with misc. off-hand tools that increase crit chance. <br /><br />Once my Lock hits 60 (curently 59) Im getting the Nemesis set, this sword, and great +crit off-hand, and 2 matchign rings for increase crit chance.</div>

I am, a healer.<br /><br /><div class="quote-box"><br />Ironbone Says:<br /><br />and for the fact that its +12 int<br /><br /></div><br /><br />I have a mana pool that rivals most priests. And theres paladins in No Quarter that have mana pools much larger than mine. We like Int =). Also if you still dont belive paladins need +Int gear, look at the Lawbringer and Judgement sets. If you STILL dont see it ill explain it for you. The primary stats are...... Stam and Int........<br /><br />Fact: Paladins are possibly the most mana efficent healers in the game. Given our illumination talent and high spell crit we can heal virtually non stop. This talent combined with a high ammount of &quot;+x mana every 5 seonds regenerated&quot; gear makes us very effective and very powerfull healers.<br /><br />Anyone that looks at the available paladin loot KNOWS that it is nearly impossible for us to get + spell crit gear. Blizzard did this for a reason, to keep us from becoming overpowered. Mages and other cloth users on the other hand have nearly endless options for + spell crit gear. Thus making the Azuresong Mageblade a VERY VERY desirable loot for paladins.<br /><br />That being said. I am not arguing that is clearly a paladin ONLY loot, im saying it is as much a paladin loot as it is a mage or warlock loot. You shouldnt grief people that know their class and know what loots will benifit them most. After all, theyre in your guild, shouldnt you trust them?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, well first of all its called a MAGEblade. That should say enough right there.<br /><br />Also, you say the pallys use every stat? (quote: RPL) What about the +dmg to spells? Yes pally have some spells. But a mage's ONLY offense is spells! I mean, someone who can tank shouldnt be getting +spl dmg.<br /><br />Now, this is a pretty good pally weapon, but with the rareness of this drop and the other options open to pallys. I mean for gods sake, if you really want a healing weapon go to ZG and get Jin'do's Hexxer:<br /><br /><a href="/classic/item=19890/jindos-hexxer">Jin'do's Hexxer</a> a much much better healing weapon. Please dont make us glass cannons beat you up over this.<br /><br />And finally. to Mykel. Do some damn research before you post. Combos are much better than staves, being able to Switch back and forth between, say, Fire Ruined Grimoire<br /><br /><a href="/classic/item=19142/fire-runed-grimoire">Fire Runed Grimoire</a> maybe, tomb of the Ice Lord:<br /><br /><a href="/classic/item=19310/tome-of-the-ice-lord">Tome of the Ice Lord</a> versatility is great. The only thing that might beat this out is Staff of the shadow flame:<br /><br /><a href="/classic/item=19356/staff-of-the-shadow-flame">Staff of the Shadow Flame</a> as far as anything MC goes, this is best for mages.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way. Mages cant use daggers. =P.<br /><br />So in conclusion. This is a mage weapon, and a very close second a lock weapon. If no mages/locks wanted (which is rare), id let priests/pallys roll, but with Hexxer and Ben/Ant (its a quest for god sakes) there for Pal/Pr, theres realy now use.<br /><br />P.S.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Paladins *cannot* make good use of this sword. The +damage goes to complete waste :- 40 plus damage doesn't even make up 1.8 dps difference between this and the aurastone. Eg a paladin with an aurastone would do higher dps. I can give a proof if you want...<br /><br />The crit heal is equivelant to under 5 mana per 5 seconds worth of regen (~ 4.666 per 5 seconds for flash of light)<br /><br />The 40 +healing is nice, but if you collect +damage gear to boost your healing you are *wasting* item points. Azuresong is a crap tanking weapon, a crap dps weapon, and a crap pvp weapon. So you're depriving your guilds mages and locks of one of the best weapons in the game, so that you can use a +damage sword for healing?<br /><br />And to any paladin that says they use every aspect of the sword, just /wrists now.<br /><br />It could be written like this :-<br /><br />Increases damage done by Arcane, Fire, Frost, Shadow, Holy, Nature and Healing spells and effects by up to 40.<br /><br />Written like that clearly a mage gets more - 3 schools vs 2 for a paladin. So stfu kindly :)<br /><br />I'll prove the dps thing anyway. Assume seal of righteousness and Holy Shock every 30 seconds. It'll add 1.6*dps to seal of righteousness, and 17 damage to holy shock. End result is 2.23dps added. Aurastone has 25 damage, it'll gain 0.9259dps on the seal, and 11 damage on holy shock. All up 1.3dps added. Aurastone = 45.6dps weapon, Azuresong = 44.73dps.<br /><br />So in summary, Azuresong is worse for DPS, and therefore worse for tanking (paladins hold aggro via doing damage, lol), a lot worse for pvp, and it's definitely worse for raid progression then a mage / lock getting it (both will gain over 15dps from equipping it).<br /><br />The problem isn't blizzard not knowing what paladins want, it's paladins not knowing what they want.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Apr 14 21:08:57 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a healadidin/protectadin, this weapon was one of the 2 end-game weapons that I wanted. I built my spec to utilize it efficiently, and I'm not going to say that this weapon is better suited for one class more than the other. It's apparent that there are differing opinions on this matter. But as a sword and board toting Pally, there aren't many choices available to us. Sure Jin'do's would be sweet, but our guild has yet to see one drop, and amongst our class, we have competition to get one should it drop. I was the first Pally in our guild to get one, and I love it. +55 Healing Power Enchant for solid base heal FTW.</div>

I raided with a shaman for months and switched to a paladin.

Lok'amir might be debateable, but the mageblade is much easier to get a hold of and has the necessary +spell crit that I look for in gear. We don't really get any in our armor so make up for it on everything else.

So, that being said, it's clearly a Mage/Warlock weapon. Why? Mages (Magus)(Mageblade), Warlocks (By definition, are DARK mages). I'm sure Mages and Warlocks will use this as their FINAL weapon, Paladins on the other hand, NOT. So, why would a Paladin roll over a Mage or a Warlock? Because they can &quot;use it for healing&quot;. ROFL<br /><br />There's no chance a Paladin would win over a Mage/Warlock on my server, simply because... Need before Greed. Warlocks and MAges need it more than Paladins do. And the only way for a Paladin to get it is if there aren't any Mages or Warlocks in the raid...<br /><br />But then again, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MC WITHOUT MAGES OR LOCKS?</div>

I got this baby already, and my guild ( farming MC n at NEffie in BWL )place the SAME dib for this baby between mages n paladin also locks.<br /><br />This sword is NOT an automatic FIRST DIB mage/lock. for those people who say:<br />1 : its for mage/lock coz the name is MAGEblade... well, i dont really need to counter this.<br />2 : they have better 1H than this baby : okay, Jindo Hexxer? the lack to +1% crit cannot balance the mana regen on that hexxer. aurastone hammer ? same like the hexxer. Lok amir il' romathis? yeah, this is definately BETTER than mageblade, but this sweety drops from Neffie.<br />3 : they have more weapon assortments than us ? : to hordies.. please stop... paladin CANNOT use DAGGERS, STAVES, Look at dagger n staves, fang of venoxxis, sorcerous dagger, claw of chrommy ( better than this sweety, n it dropped for us ), SoD, stave of the acolyte or some ( name from AQ stave with that huge +76 dmg/healing, 2% chance to hit or so ... ). Can they poor paldins TOUCH them? NO!<br />4 : we mages/locks use this better than them ? The answer is TOTAL NO. out of the 5 stats, we mages n locks use THREE of 5, int, stamina n + dmg. THEY use all 5 ( int, stamina, +dmg, +healing, WEAPON DAMAGE ). In fights of phase 1 Neffie, where the mobs rushes from the 2 doors, paladin WILL use CONCENCRATE ( +dmg is good here while we aoe them to death or kite train them ). hammer wrath is good in vael fight, WHEN they got the BA. As for normal weapon dmg, i SELDOMLY saw a lock/ mage goes berserk n melee.... but as for paladin, well.. its THEIR job.<br />5 : learn to be a cleanser? They heal, they DPS great in the UPCOMING Naxxtramas instance ( UNDEAD, where their DPS IS HUGE . I hated when mainstream class like mages always want EVERYTHING from hybrid class. I have lvl 60 paladin also, n i know the feeling when paladins cannot roll on ANYTHING rather than the 26 items that have class name : class : paladin ( lawbringer, judgement, ZG n AQ set ). Thats y i like my mage's BWL guild where paladins are not forgotten. my paly 60's guild is just mess, paladins are totally forgotten, n it HURTS a lot.<br /><br />As a side note, its THEIR hard earned DKP, so, they are free to roll on ANYTHING they want. As for hordies trying to say on pallys when YOU ALL dont know bout paladins. We ally dont say anything on shamens coz we dont really know shamens on hordie side, so please do THE SAME to ally pallies ...<br /></div><br /><br />Im glad im undead. DKP ftw by the way..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There should be no doubt that this goes to a mage or warlock. One reason is that it's simply better for those two classes then any other. Sure, pally get's the benefit of the stats and the spell crit. But if we were to look at the number of spells a pally casts compared to mages...<br /><br />I realize in MC and Ony the pally is solely there for support healing. That's SUPPORT healing. He doesn't cast as many spells to heal as a mage does to deal damage.<br /><br />Reason number two is for availability. The Paladin has a huge number of sword's and the like to chose from aside from this one. The mage has a very limited amount of other decent swords or staffs.</div>

Last but not least, let me clarify that i'm NOT saying that pallies have more use for it than mages/locks, all i'm trying to say is that we have an EQUAL potential use for it. /end rant</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Coming from someone who plays a 60 Pally and a 60 SM/Ruin Lock:<br /><br />This blade is withought question great for both casters and pallies. BUT here's how you have to judge who should get it.<br /><br />Paladins have a larger assortment of weapons to choose from and Jindo's Hexxer is without question a better Pally weapon. That said:<br /><br />ZG can be farmed every 2 days, MC every 7. Paladins have more oppertunity to get a BETTER weapon.<br /><br />The blade (and good luck contesting this statement) is MUCH more of a benefit to mage/locks than it is for Paladins. <br /><br />When you start fighting Vael in BWL, your + healing will be secondary to the DPS needed to win in 3 min. Simply put, although the weapon may be great for you... YOU ARE GIMPING YOUR RAID BY GIVING THIS TO A PALLY! Raiding is NOT abaout the individual! You need to give equipment to the classes which BEST benefit from the item... Yes, great for pallies, but MUCH better for DPS casters!<br /><br />As to the arguement of the +healing... Look at the weapons in the game... I challenge anyone to find a weapon that says JUST +damage! The +damage &amp; healing is there for the scripting language. The is no weapon that is +damage unless it is + damage to a specific school. + damage &amp; healing is the scripting term for ALL spell schools.<br /><br />Yes, great pally weapon... And if all the DPS casters have this or the Staff of Dominance then let a pally have it, it will help them. But 1st Priority on this is DPS casters (Ruin spec locks &amp; mages).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if it was a dagger then shammies would start to claim it (as those can use daggers but not swords), and if this was a staff it would truly suck ... if we want a staff we got staff of dominance that drops from the same boss, this item is just ownz the staff of dominance combined with a good off hand though (fire runed grimoire is one of them)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Every mage in the guild wants a Mageblade, making it virtually impossible for me to pick one up. So instead, I bought a Staff of Dominance, and am going to wait it out till' most of the mages/locks with higher DKP have already grabbed one, then get mine. Hopefully in that time I can pick up a fire runed grimoire.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I get tired of narrow minded people spouting off that if you dont agree with them that your a noob. Ever think that maybe they have a better grasp of the game mechanics than you do. As far as mageblade goes your just going to accept that mageblade is an exceptionally good epic and that 3 class will be bidding on it. Calm down and accept that you will most likely see most of your armor before a weapon. Weapons are expensive by nature. I dont hear warriors #$%^&amp;ing to rouges about swords. Be happy that your guild has gain even more streanth with an aditional member with that mageblade.<br /><br />Even try to push the limits to the extream. Pull multiple mobs, use a complicated strat, or Burn your mana as a handicap? For instance one consect I have been think ing about is rotating aggro between dps. DPS starts one at a time one at a time staggarded. Then in order you turn dps off in a rotation so the boss runs back and forth between the dps. Is this a practical thing to do? No but its fun when you have reached a point when the only way for things to remain a challange is to push the limits or use non traditional strat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, I understand why some of you think that this is only a caster weapon.

I agree that this should go to a lock, mage, etc first then trickle down to pallys. Let me just discuss what my guild has decided. We rotate this item. A lock got it first time, mage second, pally third. We rotate which classes should be able to use their dkp. this is a very good system in my opinion. Now, I have a 60 pally that is 23 holy/28 protection. As for some of you that say paladin's do not make good healers, let's just say that in my guild, paladin's are always at the top of the healing charts. Our priests are right behind us however, so of course, it is very close in healing. However, for those of you that say paladin's do not make good, even great healers, you obviously have not met a good one or have ever tried to play a paladin. If you have and just can't see what a great healer you are, then you're not playing the char right. Sorry, but paladin's make great healers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeap, as is stated in this thread already, Azuresong is one of the two best 1h-weapons for a paladin as every future of this sword is usefull to him. Only variant is just Jin'do's Hexxer for pure healing, but that is a question of a taste and how exactly particular paladin heals. I am used to heal between fighting and there is Azuresong definitely only variant till my raid community manage to kill Nefarian and I get in hand Lok'Amir il Romathis. <br /><br />Those who do not get it yet and mumbless in their madness something about paladin healing only, notice we can tank and do damage as well, even these roles are less accepted. Tanking paladin is probably weakest of our roles at the moment, what can change with Burning Crusade. Healing paladins land always before all other healing classes in healing charts. Retribution paladin when properly played do insane damage and will position himself just under rogues even between them in damage tables. Face it and take it. If not, go on horde side or roll paladin to find yourself how it works, however stop speaking about things you do not know or understand.<br /><br />But back to the topic. You are paladin and got this weapon. What now? Of course, make it even better as it is. What enchants come potentialy in question for this blade? +55 healing, +30 spellpower and +22 intellect. Which one is the best? Depends a lot on what exactly you do with your paladin. For our decision lets consider 5 minutes long fight what would be good average for MC and BWL, flash heals around 700HPs that crit for 1000. In 5 minutes you produce stream of 200 flash heals.<br /><br />+22 intellect, insane enchant from greedy dwarves. It makes your mana pool higher for, let be generous, 3 flash heals and you will in 5minutes healing without pause get 1 critical free heal from it, what comes to 3100 healed HPs more.<br /><br />+55 healing. In 5mins fight sitting on main tank streaming in him flash heals you will produce 200 flash heals. Each your flash heal gets a fix bonus from this enchant of 23 HPs. Giving you bonus healing of 4600 HPs.<br /><br />+30 spell power is tricky. Your spells get fixed bonus of 12 HPs and in 200 casts per fight you will heal or damage 2400 HPs. However if you are fighting, you get some bonus on your seals as well, making it even higher and I would say you will top 3000 HPs. <br /><br />Which one you want to take now? Depends on you. As I like to fight while healing and my sword is used whole time out of raid as well, I take spell power that is great allrounder. If you want only heal, go for +healing but then you should consider farming of Jin'do's Hexxer more. +22 intellect is well a garbage for us.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think it says &quot;Mageblade&quot; because that's the Class you should be sticking this thing into :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If ya note the passive stat: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells<br />and effects by up to 40.<br /><br />You can see that it is not limited only to spell dmg, but HEALING as well. If this was purposely not meant for pallies too, then they would have left out that bit. Pallies are the only healing class that can use swords.<br /><br />Other than that, its kinda free-for-all for mages, warlocks and pallies. No one class should determine if it's better for them or not, everyone uses it just as well. <br /><br />Just a thought. Wouldn't casters prefer staves? After all, there's alot more int on staves. In fact, I know of some pallies would who love get staves just for the int.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok heres the deal..<br /><br /> This weapon has BLATANTLY been put into the game for casters, it just has, live with it.<br /><br />That said, i can see how it could be useful for someone like a paladin and its not my place to tell them how to equip their toon.<br /><br />As some with raiding experience have pointed out though, if / when you actually get to see a drop like this there will be rules in place to sort out loot distribution, and that could be anything.<br />A pally might take this over a mage or warlock simply because of the time his has put it etc.<br />Or you may find that pallies are excluded until any warlocks or mages etc have got one / passed.<br /><br />But the arguement seems to be who it been put into the game for and the answer to that is a no brainer, its for casters. end of story.<br /><br />Arfur, Gnomish Warlock on Stormrage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yep this sword is definitely supposed to be a caster weapon rather than a pally... pallys, u prolly got ur +axe and +mace skills, use that.. do not roll on this if it drops, and u got a mage/warlock in the group</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>We had this drop for us last week - to answer the person's question if it still dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well the funny thing is that it says damage and healing and I don't know any mages or Locks that heal. That kind of leaves it open to interpretation as to who has a right to this weapon and could make it possible to argue it would be a good pally weapon if the pally in question is holy spec. I'm not all that familiar with pallys but I know there are better weapons for them. However it does say healing there so there was obvoiusly some intent for this weapon to be useful to more than just warlocks and mages regardless of its name. Hey if you went solely by the name it wouldn't be fit for warlocks either now would it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sorry but you've gotta be a total idiot to give this to anyone but a mage/warlock. I'd say moreso a mage because mages rely on damage and a warlock's dot critting is pretty damn worthless compared to a 900dmg fireball critting for 1300 and doing an extra 400 ignite dmg in 3 seconds. A 60 mage only needs stam and int which this clearly gives. A properly specced mage and all +crit gear will crit for over 25% of the time on a fire spell, 30%+ on scorch, which does 550 and 200 ignite in 1.5 seconds. Why would you give this to any other class?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Lost the sword to a pala today. Had the most dkp of warlocks/mages... Never thought it would happen to me, as i had the most dkp of all locks/mages.<br /><br />/cry<br /><br />Edited, Sun Jun 26 21:56:46 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Obviously there are some people here, that havn't realized a paladins position end-game. Pala's are some of the best dedicated healers in the game. It's not that they make bigger heals than f.ex. priests (cause they don't). The point is a talent-point called Illumination. This point serves, that whenever you crit with a heal, you will regain the mana spent on the heal. This means that I as a pala will be able to heal 5 mins straight without using potions, without breaks.<br />Therefor most pala's will be going for +crit, and know that their position in a MC-raid is not to do dps, nor tank. Paladins are assist healers, not tanks, therefor I would without any hesitation spent points on this sword, even though mages and locks would piss all over me.<br />Thing about name, doesn't matter. Finkle's Lava Dredger isn't only for Finkle, is it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you know an easy way to get around having to bid on this against a pally is Just roll horde they are better anyway</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well im a 60 pally, and i took this sword straight from a mage tonight. i show not one bit of remorse, because where you all base your argument on us wasting the +dmg, i counter it with saying im a holy pally, which means i doe holy dmg, and i heal. Where as mages and locks DON'T use the healing, so in a sense mages and locks put it to more waste than pallies. now im not saying pallies should have first pick over them, i got it because i have higher dkp, and would have had no problem them taking if they had higher dkp. not trying to set standards, just showing a flaw in your way of thinking about this item and its loot rules.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>so why are all mages/locks hating palas who want to bid on this?<br />simple because this is THE best mage/lock weapon, it doesn't get any better than this except maybe &quot;Claw of Chromaggus&quot; (but that's a 3% drop from a BWL boss).<br /><br />The reason Mages always cry out is simple - There's very little decent +dmg stuff out there and to compete for it with healing classes (who get a lot more powerful +healing drops) is extremely annoying.<br />would you bid on Talisman of Ephemeral Power (for that imba burst healing) or Ring of Spell Power (when there is a blue ring attainable through quest that offers better healing + stats)?<br /><br />Let's think for a moment:<br />in endgame Mages (and probably locks too) will go for the maximum +dmg gear. This forces them to take a one-handed weapon + offhand instead of a staff since this combination always yields more +dmg<br /><br />Let's say your guild is only running MC (not BWL) - the weapons available to a caster are:<br /><br />Staff of Dominance: +40dmg<br />Ironbark Staff: +41dmg (AB exalted)<br />Sorcerous Dagger: +20dmg<br />Sageclaw: +30dmg<br />Azuresong Mageblade: +40dmg<br /><br />available offhands are:<br />Fire Runed Grimoire: +11dmg<br />AV offhand: +33dmg<br />(Spirit of Aquementas: +20dmg) - way to go for a lvl50 green ^^<br /><br />there is no way around the mageblade for a caster if he wants the BEST weapon (and hasnt run BWL for 6months ^^)<br /><br />A paladin has several options to go for if he wants the item just for healing.<br />Aurastone is the most prominent, and the most sensible, since priests will be going for their epic staff anyway and druids will probably settle for Finkle's.</div>

This may have uses for a pally, but look at the damn thing, it was clearly made for a mage/lock. If a pally ever went against me for getting this I would personally punch him/her right in the face. And as for the wasting healing power comment... are you joking? That is the most ridiculous argument I have ever heard. The only way you find spell power on a weapon that is not for a particular school of magic, (i.e. shadow, fire, etc) is for it to say damage AND healing. Even check the Grand Marshal weapons. It's clear there and no one would argue that certain weapons are for pallys and certain weapons are for mages/locks. You have no idea how hard it was for me not to fill this post with cuss words at you morons posting that BS argument about &quot;wasting the healing power.&quot; Find me anything that says &quot;increases damage by spells and effects by ##.&quot; Guess what? You won't find one. Why? Because it doesnt exist.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Funny how all of these other classes are saying how they need the 1% crit just as badly as a mage.

The fact is that Healadins have a lot of things they would probably roll on and this is just one of them. I know one who uses <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17105">Aurastone Hammer</a> and yet another who uses <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18803">Finkle's Lava Dredger</a>.
