Make sure you kill the maulers too.&nbsp; You get random respawns between maulers and warlocks on each mob in the 3 caves so if you kill a mauler, it might respawn as a warlock.\n\n2. Travel back and forth betwewn the caves and you should bever have to wait for respawn. If you can convince somebody to come along with you kill the magi and brutes as well and you'll still never wait for respawn.\n\n3. Make sure you have lots of inventory space when you go.

(No other ogres affect this)[\/li]\n[li]The spawn timer of each mob is random between 5-8 minutes from when you kill them[\/li]\n[li]With a AQ\/Naxx geared furyprot tank in berserker stance it takes around 3 minutes to kill all 11 spawn points if all are spawned and around 4-5 minutes if you are out of sync with the spawning killing them as they spawn (You will heal yourself enough with bloodthirst \/ crusader proccs to keep going forever with no other healing)[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n\nWhile the absolute most efficient way to get respawns as fast as possible might be to run around like a headless chicken looking for them respawning and killing them at once, the gain is so marginal over waiting for respawns and then do a full loop. To keep my sanity I have therefore opted to start at one of the caves in the north with one spawn in them. I set up a macro with \"\/dbm break 8\" and press it once I start. After I click the macro I clear all spawn points that will have all mobs spawned. When I get back to the cave I started in the mob might spawn like 1-2 minutes before the timer runs out, but I do [b]not[\/b] kill the mob in front of me until the timer fully runs out. At that point I press the macro again and start killing once more.\nDoing things this way gives me around 5 minutes break each run to watch youtube or whatever else, while at the same time ensuring that every time I start a new run all the mobs will have respawned when I get there (or respawn just as you get to them).\n\nAs of now I am in Classic Era (phase 6) and I have probably killed around 2000 mobs with no drop, but I have only got a counter for the last 400, so I cant be sure of anything else than that.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ya ive been at it for 3 days, maybe closing in on 10 hrs or more, i would put it up there with 7 int, if your not lucky. oh well im here till it drops. at least the drop runcloth like water and ive got a bunch of things to AH while ive been here..... back to the cave i go</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dropped last night on my 3rd day of farming, was ecstatic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got it formula from chest in Noxious Glade ( EPL )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been farming this formula for about 6 hours now and still no luck. I did manage to get the +7 int formula in about an hour so I'm not complaining...yet.&nbsp; I do have a couple fo tips for anybody farming this formula:<br /><br />1. Make sure you kill the maulers too.&nbsp; You get random respawns between maulers and warlocks on each mob in the 3 caves so if you kill a mauler, it might respawn as a warlock.<br /><br />2. Travel back and forth betwewn the caves and you should bever have to wait for respawn. If you can convince somebody to come along with you kill the magi and brutes as well and you'll still never wait for respawn.<br /><br />3. Make sure you have lots of inventory space when you go. These guys drop massive amounts of runecloth, potions, greens, blues, and the occasional epic (I got a Lifestone last night, so that was 60g).<br /><br />Those are just my thoughts on it, I'll repost when I finally get the drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Spent about 5 hours last night farming for this, finally dropped, so I logged off to get some sleep.&nbsp; When I logged back on in the morning, I decited I might as well clear the cave just for giggles, another one dropped 3 kill yay.<br /><br />Cobal<br />Executus</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mattslayba</b></h3>If you're killing these and wondering if blizzard accidentally removed it with phase 3, they did not. It drops, I must have been very unlucky, but it took 1113 warlock kills.<br /><br />The item only drops from the warlocks, but they share spawns with the maulers, so make sure to kill every single mob in the cave if you on sticking around to farm this pattern.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Smilodon</b></h3>Over several days of farming off an on it finally dropped. Final kill total:<br /><br />Deadwind Mauler 340<br />Deadwind Warlock 305<br /><br />Only got a handful of greens (maybe 10 or so) no blue items and one epic <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=811/axe-of-the-deep-woods">Axe of the Deep Woods</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kher</b></h3>17-Jan-2021 , farming for about 3 hours, 118 locks dead (+130 maulers, ~100 other orges) no drop yet. 1% drop my a*s, more like 0.1%...<br />Going to farm until 150 warlocks, then ill give up. No gray / green / epic drop, just a lousy blue polearm that doesnt sell on ah, so it'll go to DE.<br />It sells on AH for about 300g. Havent seen one in weeks tho.<br /><br />Edit: 2 hours later, 181 locks dead (+++ others), no drop yet, not a single blue / epic / gray either. Only 1 green drop, some boots. <br /><br />The drop rate for this item is broken heavily. It is not 1.1%!<br />I got one green with 0.01% and one blue with 0.01%, but no recipe that has 1.1%?<br />Should be 0.1-0.3% since people farm between 300-1100 warlocks to get a drop. After ~200 locks killed, it didnt drop. That's less than 0.5% drop rate.<br /><br />Don't believe people saying they got the recipe after 1 mob, or 10 mobs, or half hour. Lies don't do well.<br /><br />I'll better go farm gold and buy it from AH, when it appears, since it'll take ages to get one to drop.<br /><br />Rip Bliz.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cyoor</b></h3>I think that I have killed a thousand of these on and off for weeks, so yesterday I added a kill counter addon and started to measure timings and similar things.<br />I killed 400 more mobs and thought that I would post some interesting things here:<br /><br /><ul><li>There are 11 spawn points in the 3 caves (one in each cave in the north and 9 in the south cave)</li><li>At least one of the mobs are on a patrolling path throughout most of the cave that you might miss if you don't take it at once when you see it (since you might run around each other)</li><li>The chance of every spawn being a Warlock/Mauler is 50% for each (within margin of error)</li><li>While only the Warlocks drop, you need to kill both Warlocks/Maulers since they share spawnpoints. (No other ogres affect this)</li><li>The spawn timer of each mob is random between 5-8 minutes from when you kill them</li><li>With a AQ/Naxx geared furyprot tank in berserker stance it takes around 3 minutes to kill all 11 spawn points if all are spawned and around 4-5 minutes if you are out of sync with the spawning killing them as they spawn (You will heal yourself enough with bloodthirst / crusader proccs to keep going forever with no other healing)</li></ul><br /><br />While the absolute most efficient way to get respawns as fast as possible might be to run around like a headless chicken looking for them respawning and killing them at once, the gain is so marginal over waiting for respawns and then do a full loop. To keep my sanity I have therefore opted to start at one of the caves in the north with one spawn in them. I set up a macro with &quot;/dbm break 8&quot; and press it once I start. After I click the macro I clear all spawn points that will have all mobs spawned. When I get back to the cave I started in the mob might spawn like 1-2 minutes before the timer runs out, but I do <b>not</b> kill the mob in front of me until the timer fully runs out. At that point I press the macro again and start killing once more.<br />Doing things this way gives me around 5 minutes break each run to watch youtube or whatever else, while at the same time ensuring that every time I start a new run all the mobs will have respawned when I get there (or respawn just as you get to them).<br /><br />As of now I am in Classic Era (phase 6) and I have probably killed around 2000 mobs with no drop, but I have only got a counter for the last 400, so I cant be sure of anything else than that. I am wondering if the drop rate might have been lowered in one of the last phases compared to earlier, because it feels like one of the most unlucky 1% farms that I have done in a while otherwise. That being said, random is random and I would guess that it drops eventually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Probenzo</b></h3>Been farming for roughly 5 hours so far mostly uncontested, no drop. Kill count must be close to 200 at this point. To add salt to the wound I was farming solo for hours, and another mage came in to compete for mobs. He got it on his 2nd kill and spam linked it to me. The ogres can drop other patterns as well, I got baited with a green BS pattern which sells for about 70s on the AH. Going to continue to grind out of principle at this point.</div>
