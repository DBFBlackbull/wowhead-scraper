Also the rewards given are different for both turn-in locations. The actual process to get Morrowgrain takes several steps as well.\n\nThe quest line starts with a quest called [b]Morrowgrain Research[\/b] which is given out by Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm. Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm may be found at Thottbot coordinates 35,8 in Darnassas. He is located at the top level of the Druid complex (Cenarion Enclave). He asks you to take a packet of 20 [b]Tharlendris seeds[\/b] to the middle level of the same complex and give them to Mathrengyl Bearwalker who gives out the next quest. That quest is also titled [b]Morrowgrain Research[\/b] (Just to confuse things).\n\nThe second [b]Morrowgrain Research[\/b] quest has you take a special pouch called an [b]Evergreen Pouch[\/b] (Provided when you receive the quest) and put into it 2 [b]Un'Goro Soil[\/b] (Collected in Un�Goro Crater) and 1 of the [b]Tharlendris seeds[\/b] from the packet (First 10 seeds given to you with the quest). With 2 Un'Goro Soil in your backpack along with 1 Tharlendris seed, you right click the Evergreen pouch. The pouch will plant the seed into the soil and grow an [b]Evergreen Herb Casing[\/b]. When you right click the casing, out will pop a random herb. One of the herbs grown may be [b]Morrowgrain[\/b]. When you have 10 of them you turn them in to complete the quest. You can repeat this quest as many times as desired. You can grow a new Evergreen Herb Casing once every 10 minutes.\n\nThere is a second parallel quest line involving Morrowgrain as well. This chain of quests starts with either Innkeeper Shyria in the Inn of Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas or with Tannysa the Herbalism trainer in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. Talking to either of these two people will give you a quest titled [b]Jonespyre's Request[\/b] which asks you to go talk to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas. Quintis Jonespyre will then give you the repeatable quest titled [b]The Mystery of Morrowgrain[\/b]. This quest is identical to the above quest (Use the Evergreen pouch to grow an Evergreen Herb Casing from 1 Tharlendris seed and 2 Un'Goro Soil and out pops a random herb) except you only need to turn in 5 Morrowgrain.\n\nIn the end, you now have two locations to turn in Morrowgrain:\n\nTurning in [b]5 Morrowgrain[\/b] to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas will give you [b]25 reputation with Darnassas[\/b]. In addition he also gives you another packet of 10 Tharlendris seeds so you can go out and grow more.\n\nTurning in [b]10 Morrowgrain[\/b] to Mathrengyl Bearwalker at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassas will earn you [b]50 reputation with Darnassas[\/b]. In addition he also gives you a [b]Cenarion Circle Cache[\/b]. Opening this will provide a random number of items as loot. Typically there are 4-8 items in the bag although I have seen only 1 before and as many as 14 per Cenarion Circle Cache. The Cenarion Circle Cache typically contains food, drinks, scrolls, potions, herbs etc. For a list of the types of items found in each Cache please see the following link: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/item=5533\/ilkrud-magthrulls-tome You can get a lot of really good stuff in these caches.\n\n[b]Where to get Un�Goro Soil:[\/b] Un�Goro Soil is found in Un�Goro Crater (Southern end of Kalimdor). Un�Goro Soil is dropped (from Dinosaurs) throughout the crater. Just run around the zone (Avoiding being stepped on or eaten by the dinosaurs) and right click the dirt piles you see laying on the ground. Un�Goro Soil is often found in the AH as well. Un�Goro Soil stacks up to 100 units per stack now.\n\n[b]Where to get Tharlendris seeds:[\/b] Tharlendris seeds may be purchased from either of the two turn-in NPCs or you can get them as part of your turn-in reward when you turn in Morrowgrain to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas.\n\n[b]Where to get an Evergreen pouch:[\/b] An Evergreen pouch is given to you when you receive the second Morrowgrain Research quest. Replacements may be purchased (For around 1 Gold) from either of the two turn-in NPCs.\n\n[b]The rewards:[\/b]\n\nOnce you have grown Evergreen Herb Casings and retrieved the herbs out of the casings you can either turn in the Morrowgrain for reputation, sell it on the AH or use it to make Cenarion Herb Bags (Manufacturing 20 slot herb bags requires 8 Morrowgrain as one of the materials to make 1 bag). In addition the loot from the Cenarion Circle Cache is typically valued at several gold and may be used or sold as needed.\n\nIn addition to growing Morrowgrain, the Evergreen Herb Casings often contains other herbs which may be used or sold as needed. How much Morrowgrain or other herbs you grow and which types depend on your Herbalism skill. As an example, I dropped the Herbalism profession completely and grew 65 Evergreen Herb Casings. Out of those casings I received the following:\n\nMorrowgrain 50\nKingsblood 6\nGromsblood 3\nEarthroot 9\nBriarthorn 8\nLiferoot 7\nMageroyal 5\nSungrass 2\n\nFor a total of 90 herbs averaging 1.48 herbs per Evergreen Herb Casing. For the most part these are lower-end herbs.\n\nI relearned Herbalism and worked it up to 300 skill level. I then grew 65 more Evergreen Herb Casings. This is what I received from those:\n\nMorrowgrain 75\nKingsblood 22\nGromsblood 2\nLiferoot 6\nSungrass 5\nStranglekelp 13\nBlindweed 5\nGoldthorn 22\nFirebloom 2\n\nFor a total of 152 herbs averaging 2.34 herbs per Evergreen Herb Casing. For the most part these are higher-end herbs. The maximum # of herbs out of any single casing is 5.\n\nAs I went up in skill level, the numbers and types of herbs increased steadily.\n\nAll in all 300 Herbalism will result in a 50% increase in Morrowgrain output and a 70% increase in the number of herbs grown as well as large increase in the value of the herbs.\n\nMost people performing the Morrowgrain quests keep the pouch, seeds and soil in their backpack and as they run around Azeroth they pop out a new batch of herbs once every ten minutes. For an Alchemist this results in a steady supply of herbs for use in potions and for others it results in a steady supply of cash from the sale of those herbs. The hardest part is having enough space in your bags for all those herbs!","date":"2006-08-06T09:08:27-05:00","rating":146,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"DavidManvell","importedSubject":"Morrowgrain quests:"},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"id":2650468,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"GREAT POST.&nbsp; It really helped.&nbsp; Horde side you can pick up the quest in Thunderbluff, Elder Rise, the big boss.\n\nI bought 100 un'goro soil for 12 gold and I've been growing them all day long.","date":"2006-08-06T09:08:27-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"fuglette","importedSubject":"great post"},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":2650480,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I must just be plain unlucky, I've grown 18 Evergreen Herb Casings and only recieved 3 Morrowgrain(from the same casing no less.)\n\nPrepare to be patient or lucky.","date":"2006-09-11T21:08:27-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"plazz_twilight","importedSubject":"Unlucky"},{"commentv2":1,"number":14,"id":2650489,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"dunno if this was ever true, but i seem to remember a time when these quests gave CC rep?","date":"2006-09-11T21:08:27-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"aeloro","importedSubject":"?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":15,"id":2650513,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Having a high level of herbalisme really improves the rate of the morrowgrain drops.\nWhen i try to cultivate it with my main (eng\/min) i got 4morrowgrain in 10tries.

Also the rewards given are different for both turn-in locations. The actual process to get Morrowgrain takes several steps as well.\n\nThe quest line starts with a quest called [b]Morrowgrain Research[\/b] which is given out by Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm. Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm may be found at Thottbot coordinates 35,8 in Darnassas. He is located at the top level of the Druid complex (Cenarion Enclave). He asks you to take a packet of 20 [b]Tharlendris seeds[\/b] to the middle level of the same complex and give them to Mathrengyl Bearwalker who gives out the next quest. That quest is also titled [b]Morrowgrain Research[\/b] (Just to confuse things).\n\nThe second [b]Morrowgrain Research[\/b] quest has you take a special pouch called an [b]Evergreen Pouch[\/b] (Provided when you receive the quest) and put into it 2 [b]Un'Goro Soil[\/b] (Collected in Un’Goro Crater) and 1 of the [b]Tharlendris seeds[\/b] from the packet (First 10 seeds given to you with the quest). With 2 Un'Goro Soil in your backpack along with 1 Tharlendris seed, you right click the Evergreen pouch. The pouch will plant the seed into the soil and grow an [b]Evergreen Herb Casing[\/b]. When you right click the casing, out will pop a random herb. One of the herbs grown may be [b]Morrowgrain[\/b]. When you have 10 of them you turn them in to complete the quest. You can repeat this quest as many times as desired. You can grow a new Evergreen Herb Casing once every 10 minutes.\n\nThere is a second parallel quest line involving Morrowgrain as well. This chain of quests starts with either Innkeeper Shyria in the Inn of Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas or with Tannysa the Herbalism trainer in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. Talking to either of these two people will give you a quest titled [b]Jonespyre's Request[\/b] which asks you to go talk to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas. Quintis Jonespyre will then give you the repeatable quest titled [b]The Mystery of Morrowgrain[\/b]. This quest is identical to the above quest (Use the Evergreen pouch to grow an Evergreen Herb Casing from 1 Tharlendris seed and 2 Un'Goro Soil and out pops a random herb) except you only need to turn in 5 Morrowgrain.\n\nIn the end, you now have two locations to turn in Morrowgrain:\n\nTurning in [b]5 Morrowgrain[\/b] to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas will give you [b]25 reputation with Darnassas[\/b]. In addition he also gives you another packet of 10 Tharlendris seeds so you can go out and grow more.\n\nTurning in [b]10 Morrowgrain[\/b] to Mathrengyl Bearwalker at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassas will earn you [b]50 reputation with Darnassas[\/b]. In addition he also gives you a [b]Cenarion Circle Cache[\/b]. Opening this will provide a random number of items as loot. Typically there are 4-8 items in the bag although I have seen only 1 before and as many as 14 per Cenarion Circle Cache. The Cenarion Circle Cache typically contains food, drinks, scrolls, potions, herbs etc. For a list of the types of items found in each Cache please see the following link: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/item=5533\/ilkrud-magthrulls-tome You can get a lot of really good stuff in these caches.\n\n[b]Where to get Un’Goro Soil:[\/b] Un’Goro Soil is found in Un’Goro Crater (Southern end of Kalimdor). Un’Goro Soil is dropped (from Dinosaurs) throughout the crater. Just run around the zone (Avoiding being stepped on or eaten by the dinosaurs) and right click the dirt piles you see laying on the ground. Un’Goro Soil is often found in the AH as well. Un’Goro Soil stacks up to 100 units per stack now.\n\n[b]Where to get Tharlendris seeds:[\/b] Tharlendris seeds may be purchased from either of the two turn-in NPCs or you can get them as part of your turn-in reward when you turn in Morrowgrain to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas.\n\n[b]Where to get an Evergreen pouch:[\/b] An Evergreen pouch is given to you when you receive the second Morrowgrain Research quest. Replacements may be purchased (For around 1 Gold) from either of the two turn-in NPCs.\n\n\n[b]The rewards:[\/b]\n\nOnce you have grown Evergreen Herb Casings and retrieved the herbs out of the casings you can either turn in the Morrowgrain for reputation, sell it on the AH or use it to make Cenarion Herb Bags (Manufacturing 20 slot herb bags requires 8 Morrowgrain as one of the materials to make 1 bag). In addition the loot from the Cenarion Circle Cache is typically valued at several gold and may be used or sold as needed.\n\nIn addition to growing Morrowgrain, the Evergreen Herb Casings often contains other herbs which may be used or sold as needed. How much Morrowgrain or other herbs you grow and which types depend on your Herbalism skill. As an example, I dropped the Herbalism profession completely and grew 65 Evergreen Herb Casings. Out of those casings I received the following:\n\nMorrowgrain 50\nKingsblood 6\nGromsblood 3\nEarthroot 9\nBriarthorn 8\nLiferoot 7\nMageroyal 5\nSungrass 2\n\nFor a total of 90 herbs averaging 1.48 herbs per Evergreen Herb Casing. For the most part these are lower-end herbs.\n\nI relearned Herbalism and worked it up to 300 skill level. I then grew 65 more Evergreen Herb Casings. This is what I received from those:\n\nMorrowgrain 75\nKingsblood 22\nGromsblood 2\nLiferoot 6\nSungrass 5\nStranglekelp 13\nBlindweed 5\nGoldthorn 22\nFirebloom 2\n\nFor a total of 152 herbs averaging 2.34 herbs per Evergreen Herb Casing. For the most part these are higher-end herbs. The maximum # of herbs out of any single casing is 5.\n\nAs I went up in skill level, the numbers and types of herbs increased steadily.\n\nAll in all 300 Herbalism will result in a 50% increase in Morrowgrain output and a 70% increase in the number of herbs grown as well as large increase in the value of the herbs.\n\nMost people performing the Morrowgrain quests keep the pouch, seeds and soil in their backpack and as they run around Azeroth they pop out a new batch of herbs once every ten minutes. For an Alchemist this results in a steady supply of herbs for use in potions and for others it results in a steady supply of cash from the sale of those herbs. The hardest part is having enough space in your bags for all those herbs!","date":"2006-08-01T18:01:40-05:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"davidmanvell","importedSubject":"Morrowgrain quests:"},{"commentv2":1,"number":30,"id":5251410,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"terminalman","body":"The chance of getting Morrowgrain from the pouch seems related to two things:\r\n[ol]\r\n[li]Level of the current zone[\/li]\r\n[li]Character’s herbalism level[\/li]\r\n[\/ol]\r\n\r\nIn Stormwind my 375 herbalist burned through twenty packs of seeds and got just 3 Morrowgrain.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im A human. I want A tiger mount. I am level 60.<br />To get exalted (I am half way to revered), I have to turn in 490 stacks of 10 Morrowgrain OR 4,900 total Morrowgrain. At level 60 I get 55 rep. per 10 I turn in. I would reccomend doing this at A lower level so you get double the exp. Say A gnome wants to get exalted and is level 47( assuming the same rep. as me), that gnome only has to turn in half what I have to turn in just because the quest is out of level range for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The best approach to this I've found is to kill two birds with one stone.&nbsp; First, go farm a bunch of Un'Goro soil. It drops from the mobs in the Crater, but it's usually easier to just mount up and look for mounds (the Gatherer mod is a godsend for this).&nbsp; Take your soil, some seed packets, and head out to farm for Runecloth.&nbsp; Every ten minutes pop out a packet, grow some herb, then keep farming the cloth.<br /><br />Rep farming is a long grind, so any time you can dobule up your efforts will be well spent.&nbsp; Now if they would just come up with similar alternatives to the cloth for the other cities...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I read this some other place on thottbot, I decided to check it out and it works!<br /><br />When you go and deliver in your 10x you will get 50 reputation points with Darnassus (55 if you are human like me, because of our Diplomacy Racial). The reward is only that, and nothing more whatsoever.<br /><br />BUT! If you go to Quintis Jonespyre in Feathermoon Stronghold in western Feralas, you will be far better out:<br />You can deliver stacks of 5x Morrowgrain to him. This will not only give you reputation with Darnassus, it will also give you 10x Packet of Thelandris Seeds for free! After some time you will have so many that you won't know where to put them! If you deliver your Morrowgrain in Darnassus you will NOT receive the packets upon completion!<br /><br />That is something to think of :)<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, if you are still a herbalist you might also have alchemy - at the bottom of this tower there is a Master Alchemist who will teach you some neat recipes (level 230-270) if you haven't gotten them before!<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I started out very, VERY frustrated because I was getting jack in terms of Morrowgrain.Was getting good herbs but I can get those herbs anytime as a 300 Herber.... But I stuck with it and it seemed like it just got better and better. Took about 4 packs of seeds before the ball really got rolling in terms of Morrowgrain....3 or 4 Morrowgrain at a time. I now have 4 stacks saved up for a trip to Darnassus.<br /><br />That is just my experience, not sure if anyone else has seen it that way. <br /><br />That being said, show some damn patience. :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After turning in 10 morrowgrain at Darnassus, you get a nice little package which usually contains several high-level potions.&nbsp; If you look at the materials required to make some of these potions and in which crafts some of these potions are required, you will understand the value of morrowgrain turn ins at Darnassus.<br /><br />It is also helpful to have a low-level alchemist who can take advantage of all the herbs made by the cenarian bag that are NOT morrowgrain.&nbsp; <br /><br />All in all, I have had some very expensive potions come out of Darnassus turn ins that I've used in crafting armors and whatnot.&nbsp; Keep that in mind when you feel frustrated by this process.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dunno if this was ever true, but i seem to remember a time when these quests gave CC rep?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Having a high level of herbalisme really improves the rate of the morrowgrain drops.<br />When i try to cultivate it with my main (eng/min) i got 4morrowgrain in 10tries. But with my alt (herb 315) i got 16morrowgrain out of 10 tries.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My brother and I did this quest at the same time. He is not an herbalist, and I am. I turned out more than twice as much morrowgrain as he did with the same number of seeds. Also, as stated above, people without herbalism tend to create lower level herbs with the casting pouch. <br /><br />I'm a Night Elf, so I could live without the rep for turning in the morrowgrain... I just do it for the cache! Good stuff in there for mana classes. I keep the drinks and scrolls, but sell all the potions at the AH. I make between 3-10 gold off of each cache, which more than pays for the cost of the seeds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I seem to get more morrowgrain after midnight.&nbsp; Could there be a different percentage for different times of day?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i haven't noticed a diffenrence in time of day, however that is possible as other things in azeroth depends on time of day as well.<br /><br />I have on the other hand experienced a lot of difference in the amount of morrowgrain i get depending on the current zone i'm in. lvl 50+ zones tend to yield up to twice as much morrowgrain which, since it's considered a 'drop' from the casings, kinda make sence. I have yet to experiment with the making of casings in low lvl zones and open them in highlvl zones and vice versa.<br /><br />side note: i'm not a herbalist</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ever since I discovered the Morrowgrain &quot;path&quot; it has become a fairly reasonable cash cow! One loop through Un'Goro (avoiding fights) usually nets me around 50 soil in less than an hour. From that I get as much as two stacks (20x2) of Morrowgrain which I have been breaking down into stacks of 8 and selling in AH for 6-8g each. The first week I did this I made nearly 100g from just a couple runs.<br /><br />One odd thing that I have yet to prove is that Morrowgrain seems to pop out more often in Un'Goro than in other zones. And for a test I spent some time on the dirt piles behind the Cenarion Circle in Darnassus and had my highest percentage of Morrowgrain yet!<br /><br />High end tailors NEED this herb for large herb bags! Price accordingly!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've handed in the 10 required for the reward about 5 or 6 times and I've noticed that each time I've handed it in, the reward was less and less. <br /><br />It began with giving me a few different high lvl stat/dmg potions, heal pots, and food but, by the 3th or 4th time, was only a couple pieces of food a maybe one heal pot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">&quot;Morrowgrain is not used in any recipes&quot;</div><br />It is now.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>morrowgrain is also used in the 20 slot herb bag recipe, it takes 8 morrowgrain and 10 purple lotus, as well as runecloth and runethread.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Every 10 morrowgrain you turn in you can get another cenarion cache package.. they usually have some scrolls/potions/food/water<br /><br />The potions are pretty high skill level<br /><br />Morrowgrain is not used in any recipes</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have heard rumors but cannot find any more info. Can this be picked with herbalism? If so, where?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />-Lunarius</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As it says its used to make the cenarion herb bag, and I wanted to get an herb bag; once I got about 14 of them for the quest it started giving me about every herb but morrowgrain. Anyone else have this problem?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This information should be accurate as of patch 1.11.2<br />------------------------------<br />------------------------------<br /><b>Morrowgrain quests:</b><br /><br />The Morrowgrain quests can be quite involved as there are two quest givers and turn-in locations. Also the rewards given are different for both turn-in locations. The actual process to get Morrowgrain takes several steps as well.<br /><br />The quest line starts with a quest called <b>Morrowgrain Research</b> which is given out by Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm. Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm may be found at Thottbot coordinates 35,8 in Darnassas. He is located at the top level of the Druid complex (Cenarion Enclave). He asks you to take a packet of 20 <b>Tharlendris seeds</b> to the middle level of the same complex and give them to Mathrengyl Bearwalker who gives out the next quest. That quest is also titled <b>Morrowgrain Research</b> (Just to confuse things).<br /><br />The second <b>Morrowgrain Research</b> quest has you take a special pouch called an <b>Evergreen Pouch</b> (Provided when you receive the quest) and put into it 2 <b>Un'Goro Soil</b> (Collected in Un’Goro Crater) and 1 of the <b>Tharlendris seeds</b> from the packet (First 10 seeds given to you with the quest). With 2 Un'Goro Soil in your backpack along with 1 Tharlendris seed, you right click the Evergreen pouch. The pouch will plant the seed into the soil and grow an <b>Evergreen Herb Casing</b>. When you right click the casing, out will pop a random herb. One of the herbs grown may be <b>Morrowgrain</b>. When you have 10 of them you turn them in to complete the quest. You can repeat this quest as many times as desired. You can grow a new Evergreen Herb Casing once every 10 minutes.<br /><br />There is a second parallel quest line involving Morrowgrain as well. This chain of quests starts with either Innkeeper Shyria in the Inn of Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas or with Tannysa the Herbalism trainer in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. Talking to either of these two people will give you a quest titled <b>Jonespyre's Request</b> which asks you to go talk to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas. Quintis Jonespyre will then give you the repeatable quest titled <b>The Mystery of Morrowgrain</b>. This quest is identical to the above quest (Use the Evergreen pouch to grow an Evergreen Herb Casing from 1 Tharlendris seed and 2 Un'Goro Soil and out pops a random herb) except you only need to turn in 5 Morrowgrain.<br /><br />In the end, you now have two locations to turn in Morrowgrain:<br /><br />Turning in <b>5 Morrowgrain</b> to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas will give you <b>25 reputation with Darnassas</b>. In addition he also gives you another packet of 10 Tharlendris seeds so you can go out and grow more.<br /><br />Turning in <b>10 Morrowgrain</b> to Mathrengyl Bearwalker at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassas will earn you <b>50 reputation with Darnassas</b>. In addition he also gives you a <b>Cenarion Circle Cache</b>. Opening this will provide a random number of items as loot. Typically there are 4-8 items in the bag although I have seen only 1 before and as many as 14 per Cenarion Circle Cache. The Cenarion Circle Cache typically contains food, drinks, scrolls, potions, herbs etc. For a list of the types of items found in each Cache please see the following link: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5533/ilkrud-magthrulls-tome">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5533/ilkrud-magthrulls-tome</a> You can get a lot of really good stuff in these caches.<br /><br /><b>Where to get Un’Goro Soil:</b> Un’Goro Soil is found in Un’Goro Crater (Southern end of Kalimdor). Un’Goro Soil is dropped (from Dinosaurs) throughout the crater. Just run around the zone (Avoiding being stepped on or eaten by the dinosaurs) and right click the dirt piles you see laying on the ground. Un’Goro Soil is often found in the AH as well. Un’Goro Soil stacks up to 100 units per stack now.<br /><br /><b>Where to get Tharlendris seeds:</b> Tharlendris seeds may be purchased from either of the two turn-in NPCs or you can get them as part of your turn-in reward when you turn in Morrowgrain to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas.<br /><br /><b>Where to get an Evergreen pouch:</b> An Evergreen pouch is given to you when you receive the second Morrowgrain Research quest. Replacements may be purchased (For around 1 Gold) from either of the two turn-in NPCs.<br /><br /><b>The rewards:</b><br /><br />Once you have grown Evergreen Herb Casings and retrieved the herbs out of the casings you can either turn in the Morrowgrain for reputation, sell it on the AH or use it to make Cenarion Herb Bags (Manufacturing 20 slot herb bags requires 8 Morrowgrain as one of the materials to make 1 bag). In addition the loot from the Cenarion Circle Cache is typically valued at several gold and may be used or sold as needed.<br /><br />In addition to growing Morrowgrain, the Evergreen Herb Casings often contains other herbs which may be used or sold as needed. How much Morrowgrain or other herbs you grow and which types depend on your Herbalism skill. As an example, I dropped the Herbalism profession completely and grew 65 Evergreen Herb Casings. Out of those casings I received the following:<br /><br />Morrowgrain 50<br />Kingsblood 6<br />Gromsblood 3<br />Earthroot 9<br />Briarthorn 8<br />Liferoot 7<br />Mageroyal 5<br />Sungrass 2<br /><br />For a total of 90 herbs averaging 1.48 herbs per Evergreen Herb Casing. For the most part these are lower-end herbs.<br /><br />I relearned Herbalism and worked it up to 300 skill level. I then grew 65 more Evergreen Herb Casings. This is what I received from those:<br /><br />Morrowgrain 75<br />Kingsblood 22<br />Gromsblood 2<br />Liferoot 6<br />Sungrass 5<br />Stranglekelp 13<br />Blindweed 5<br />Goldthorn 22<br />Firebloom 2<br /><br />For a total of 152 herbs averaging 2.34 herbs per Evergreen Herb Casing. For the most part these are higher-end herbs. The maximum # of herbs out of any single casing is 5.<br /><br />As I went up in skill level, the numbers and types of herbs increased steadily.<br /><br />All in all 300 Herbalism will result in a 50% increase in Morrowgrain output and a 70% increase in the number of herbs grown as well as large increase in the value of the herbs.<br /><br />Most people performing the Morrowgrain quests keep the pouch, seeds and soil in their backpack and as they run around Azeroth they pop out a new batch of herbs once every ten minutes. For an Alchemist this results in a steady supply of herbs for use in potions and for others it results in a steady supply of cash from the sale of those herbs. The hardest part is having enough space in your bags for all those herbs!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>terminalman</b></h3>The chance of getting Morrowgrain from the pouch seems related to two things:<br /><ol><li>Level of the current zone</li><li>Character’s herbalism level</li></ol><br /><br />In Stormwind my 375 herbalist burned through twenty packs of seeds and got just 3 Morrowgrain. Three!<br /><br />In Shattrath I’m getting Morrowgrain 90%+ of the time.<br /><br />So much for basing my herbalist in Stormwind 🤨</div>
