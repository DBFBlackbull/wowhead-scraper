<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Warlocks should be getting a small buff from these bags like hunters do. Soul shards in their one per slot form was already bad design, and Blizzard's concept of fixing is that you will have to sac something that is designed correctly (in this case a full bag slot) to get somewhat of a work-around.<br /><br />I'm sure this is nice for raids but still I think Blizzard did a half-assed job with this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Didn't drop, do you have to 5-man her?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Not a drop, there's a book in Jandice's room.<br /><br />I'll stick with the standard 20-slot soul pouch until the MC pattern drops for my guild, 4 more slots for all that felcloth, hardly seems worth the effort...&nbsp; But 28 slots, I could justify that, especially since it's the top of the line model (the MC bag that is).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is this 100% drop? We killed her, and the emote said<br />&quot;Jandice Barov loosens her grasp on the journal she had been holding&quot;<br /><br />But no book appeared, and we couldn't learn the pattern.<br /><br />Is there a different emote that she says when the book DOES drop?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Don't want to end up at Jandice not being able to learn it. I've got 242 tailoring so far.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>forget it, i got 278 tailoring and wasnt able to learn it from the book. I was able to click it and it said sth like: &quot;It seems to tell how to make some sort of bag, but you are not a tailor good enough to understand it&quot;<br /><br />So requirements are 280 at least. maybe 290 or 300, don't know. Anyone know the exact level?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The regular soul pouch is 260 tailoring while the core felcloth bag is 300.&nbsp; As another poster said, the bag pattern is unable to be learned at level 278, and knowing that the pattern is yellow to a level 300 tailor, it is somewhere between 275-285 for a skill req.&nbsp; So it's fairly safe to say that the skill requirement is 280 (or a slightly more unlikely 285) for the Felcloth Bag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The book isnt looted from the corpse, it spawns on the floor and then tailors can copy it , kinda like the repair bot schematics in BRD.<br /><br />Materials for bag cost roughly 50g in total on my realm. I reckon tailors could charge a nice fee since the boss which you get it from is usually skipped by pickup groups.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went in today and it dropped just fine. Someone in the group mentioned that last time it didn't drop and&nbsp; it might have been because Janice died so close to the wall. I know that many groups fight her in her little room to avoid clearing the area around her. Since that place is so cramped, I can see her dieing next to a wall and having the book drop inside the wall as a bug.<br /><br />So a good tip might be to make sure that you clear that entire last row and pull her out a little into in the hall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We went to Scholo and Jandice looking for this to &quot;drop&quot; with 5 people (non raid).&nbsp; On our first run, she died in the middle of the outside area(ie, not in her little room), the emote came up, but we saw no book on the ground.<br /><br />We reset the instance, did exactly the same thing, and she died at the exact same place.&nbsp; This time, a big book appear right beside her corpse.<br /><br />Intended or not, the &quot;drop&quot; does not appear to drop 100%.&nbsp; So if you don't get it the first time, try again.<br /><br />The book can be read by multiple person.&nbsp; I am not sure about the required tailoring level as I am 300 myself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went into Scholo with a 281 tailoring skill, and I was still too low. My guess would be 285 or 290...<br /><br />Just passing that along, because I came here to get an answer to that very question. I am going to make another run in there tonight, after I lvl to 285 and then post my findings<br /><br />^.^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What level does this bag require in order to equip it, soul pouch is 1, core felcloth is 60, is this 60 too? 50s? or 1? i know it says item level 57, but usually that means how strong of an item it is, ie tier 2 epics are like 70+, just wondering if the item level is actually the level required in this case</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im preaty sure the book is 100% drop now since ive killed her 10x + while farming rep and for my shoulders, she always, ALWAYS, seem to drop her book, only thing is insufficeint tailoring skill to learn the pattern it has to be 285-300 im 283 and cant learn it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You <b>must</b> be 285+ Tailoring to be able to learn this recipe.<br /><br />The Recipe is <b>NOT</b> a drop, it is a book that fell off <u>Jandice Barov</u> in Scholomance after you kill it.

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
