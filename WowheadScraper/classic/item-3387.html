(unlike a Paladin's bubble)  In general it's ok for casters, but only in limited circumstances.  You can also still be interrupted with this on.  Not sure if all interupts work, but a healer (druid) in my UBRS raid last night found out that he could still be kicked with this shield up.

It's said then when you use one you cannot be target of Smoking Blasts. By letting everybody drink one, except the tank, you will be sure the tank gets the smoking blast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Slash</b></h3>These are very useful for a warlock attempting to counter a rogue's Cloak of Shadows.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does this potion trigger the in-combat potion timer thus preventing me from using a heal potion during battle?<br /><br />Also, what is the cooldown on the potion?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It activates the incombat potion timer...<br /><br />2 min cooldown...<br /><br />can be goddly when used in the right situation.&nbsp; Example:<br /><br />4 Rogues were guarding a mage in a PvP battle.&nbsp; You go up to kill the mage, they would come out and kill you in about 2seconds.<br /><br />Snunk in, ambush 1/2 his life away, pop the invun pot right after while all the rogues wail on you wondering why they cant hit you, kill the mage before he has any idea whats going on.&nbsp; Vanish and leave the other rogues confused :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You say that these potions are great for sneaking into a guarded area and making out with treasure. But the potion only lasts 6 seconds. You're better off using an invisibility potion instead. It'll last 18 seconds, and it's not like many mobs can detect it. The invisibility potion will last 3 times as long, which will be much more handy to steal what you want, and hearth/run out.<br /><br />These potions are for priests, raid runs, and somewhat for PvP. Mob running after you, and fade won't cut it? Chug one of these, it'll buy you a guaranteed 6 seconds for someone to save your ass. Core hound looks your way? It just might save you from getting 2-shotted. It won't work too well against an assist train, since lots of damage is magic based in PvP. But a rogue ganker? 6 seconds may be all you need to win, unless you're a priest vs. an undead rogue, in which case not even God can save you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had to walk through an armada of lvl 61 Elite demons in Blasted Lands to get to a questguy, and I used one of these while accepting the quest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I saw once a video from a shaman doing pvp, and it looks like its VERY usefull.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its because the needed reagents are not always easy to find, but i would like to have such potions in my bags in case if i have more players from opposed faction running behind me. <br /><br />6 seconds invulnerable can save ur life.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>does this break stun?<br /><br />i am not asking about imunzing - just break?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This potion comes in handy during Razorgore the Untamed encounter. Just give a bottle to every kiter so that they will have a last-ditch remedy in case a draconid/legionnaire catches up with them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Note that the aggro reduction is 100% for the duration of the invulnerability buff, but you regain your aggro immediately after the buff fades.&nbsp; It acts like Fade and not Vanish.<br /><br />This is still quite useful as it gives the tank a nice window to regain aggro over the mob/boss.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Probally a stupid question, does this cause you to drop the flag in WG?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This potion does, in fact, dump aggro, but only during the duration of the potion.&nbsp; At the end of the 6 sec effect, you'll gain all that aggro right back.&nbsp; As far as I know, you don't accumulate aggro during the 6 seconds, but I may be wrong.&nbsp; Sure, you could use this in the Razorgore fight to lose mobs, but you'll still be kiting them when the effect wears off.</div>

Not enugh time..<br /><br />third and somewhat final try, I just distracted them on the far end of the room and looted the egg, they didn't see me, even had time to restealth and move over to a safe spot to hearthstone.. <br /><br />So, distract &gt; this pot in rogue questing :(<br /><br />Ohh and, I've heard that you don't lose aggro with this pot. It's just like a extra fade. You get all your aggro back when the pot wears off but hopefully the tanks have aggroed the mobs enugh by then.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 4th 2006 at 9:25am EDT by Aenonar</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 4th 2006 at 9:31am EDT by Aenonar</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is an excelent potion for Cloth-bearers. This potion will shed agro! If you manage to draw agro when in a group fight, simply quaff this potion and watch as the mobs immediately turn around and attack other party members. It does not eliminate agro however, it simply puts you on the bottom of the mob's &quot;hate list&quot;. I always cary a stack of these into instance runs.<br /><br />Two considerations; you can still recapture agro. So after drinking this potion, kick back a second and bandage yourself or something. Let the Warrior re-establish agro. Also, I have not confirmed if drinking this potion will shed the agro of mob spell casters. It definetly works on mele mobs and Bosses though. <br />Marlach</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Great for completing quests you can run in and do you stuff.</div>
