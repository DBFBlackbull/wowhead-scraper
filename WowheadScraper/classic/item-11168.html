<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No one talks about this one much, but my mage on Burning Blade is level 50 and has 300 enchanting skill.&nbsp; I am one of the few or maybe the only one that has this enchant.&nbsp; No one adverts it, and it is never for sale in the AH, except once, when I bought it for under 5g.&nbsp; Really, it is quite an amazing enchant for melee shield users.&nbsp; I watch the AH every day, and the only time I saw the formula was the day I bought it.&nbsp; Must be an uber rare drop, even though lower level.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Never even heard about this enchant til today.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I aggree, very rare. I�m looking for that one for a very long time. I got all Drop-Enchanting-Recipes until 230, exept this one. <br /><br />thottbot says here, that Level 36 Bloodfen Raptors in Dustwallow are droping it with 0.1% chance.....hm..maybe i should give it a try and go there (with my Level 49 Warlock.....lol). <br /><br />But is it really useful for Warriors or Paladins? My husband is still using his Mithril Spike and prefers more Damage,&nbsp; but his Paladin is still lowlevel (34), maybe for highlevel-Chars more interesting? <br /><br />But what is about +7 Stamina on Shields (Vendor-Recipe for 265-Enchanters), isn�t that better than +2% blocking...?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Alinka /w me if u need it on warsong(eu) -15g</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>2% Block are imo by far better than 70hp <br /><br />because if you block even one hit, you will prevent more than only 70 hp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Boneflayer ghouls in Razorfen Downs have the highest drop rate at 0.3%, so I've soloed Razorfen Downs at least 20 times from start to end (taking a right at the fork in the beginning) with my mage. And no formula. I've seen it at the AH for no lower than 200g... maybe it's more worthwhile to farm for the money and buy it than trying to farm this recipe. Damn rare, if it still exists.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got this recipe from a strong iron lockbox on Gorgonash, compared it to other shield enchants up in AH and stuck it there for 5g, then looked here and immediately pulled it down.&nbsp; I sold it within a few minutes for 60g.&nbsp; Probably should have put back it AH and tried for more.&nbsp; Ah well</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i guess some of you dont know the greatness of this recipe...<br /><br />its for endgame only pretty much.&nbsp; just for tanks&nbsp; cuz block%/dodge%/and parry% is incredibly important for a tank.&nbsp; on Crushridge (Horde) this recipe is on AH for around 700g.&nbsp; consider yourself lucky if you have it or bought it for a very cheap price.&nbsp; you cant really sell this enchant for much because the mats are so easy to get, and people would probably refuse to pay 100g for it, but if you're the only person on the server that can do it (i dont have the recipe), then you can do whatever you please :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have this on one of my characters. I didn't know it was anything special. Think it dropped in SM or something. And suddenly loots of very good warriors want it. :D<br />I could probably make a fortune out of it, but I won't... the Alliance shall suffer! This is going cheeeap... *cackle*<br />Enchanters - look out for it, the droprate is insane.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got very lucky with this, bought it in the AH for 4g</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>was wondering, is this still a viable enchant.<br />since BC realease u got Tough Shield, witch is very nice, but is lesser block better ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>back in the day when it said 2%.. ya. that sucks. sta IS better. +2% to block. lol. back before BC. i dont think there was a shield that had this much block. but even if you did have a shield with 100 block. +2% adds 2 block points to the original block value. completely not worth the several hundred gold. but now after BC. they changed what it sais. to +10 to block.. so now i want the enchant. untill they had changed it. i settled for the sta enchant. 2% just wasnt worth all the money.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This just dropped for me in the SM Graveyard off some random ghost.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my eyes this enchant is now fairly obsolete, it still has its uses, but<br />when you compare it to the new 18 stamina enchant that can be easily learned<br />I find this enchant out of date.<br /><br />I have seen it lately on AH for 400G bid and 500G buyout and with all respect,<br />it made me giggle, as I find those prices unreasonable for such a enchant after<br />TBC has been released.<br /><br />(For those that may try to say &quot;Oh you just wish you could buy it&quot; or anything<br />similar with this, believe me or not, I do actually have this enchant from long<br />ago and I did pay 350G for it back then, I just find the current price to be funny<br />as I think this enchant is worth no more than 40G.)<br /><br />It was a good enchant, but now it has been surpassed.<br />Welcome to the World of TBC-makes-most-our-old-efforts-and-gears-useless.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Feb 10th 2007 1:16pm by babyorphan</i></div>

Mob misses you 5% of the time, so anything beyond 20% is wasted. Get 7 Stamina instead, cause it works always, not only when you're hit in melee.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
