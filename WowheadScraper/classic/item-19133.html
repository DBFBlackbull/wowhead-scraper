But when you have nine priests in a Molten Core raid, having all nine heal is just going to be massive overheal and mana waste. Why not get a bit more DPS by having two of them go shadowform and melt faces?\n\nThat's what we do anyway. =) Pfft, nearly half the time I use Shadowform on trash mobs and easy bosses in MC. I can still clean, still shield, and I add a bit more DPS if there's a lot of priests. With 16 debuff slots, having 4 priests drop Shadow Word on a mob is a pretty good amount of added damage. Also, the Shadow Vulnerability debuff from a shadow priest will increase the damage of any warlock's shadowbolt. Shadow priest and warlock damage overlap nicely.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, any time there's fewer than six priests (or we happen to be low on druids and pallies) I put on the +healing gear and spam flash heal just like the Disc\/Holy folks.\n\nQuote: [i].. will mean losing warlock for your guild, now just try to do Garr with 2locks o.O[\/i]\n\nPfft, Garr is weaksauce.

Not to mention priests by far get the best damage boosts from talents. 10% from darkness, another 15% from shadow&nbsp; form, and then 3% more keeps adding up to 5 times after that.

I am currently a shadow priest and my guild is on Chromaggus in BWL, I am allowed to raid and am actually always in there. \n\nShadow priests are always overestimated in pvp and always underestimated in pve. It's pretty stupid. The matter of the fact is that high end raiding guilds could all use at least one shadow priest, the dps that comes from a shadow priest is higher than most other classes. I am currently out dpsing every class and I still have blue gear. (only one person I cant out dps and he has high warlord gear)\n\nNot trying to hype up priest dps but it's just logic and math.

IMO a shadow specced priest who will actually raid as a shadow priest benefits most from these pants because they get the most bonus from it and dont have set pieces that they can obtain to help their spec yet.

If you're guild is short-sighted enough with its loot to let anyone other then a lock get these, perhaps you should find a new guild, I sure as hell would.\n\nAnswer me this: if you are a shadow priest, trying to do damage on a raid...how long does your very limited MP last you, hmm?  All that +damage gear does you no good when you are OOM.  Get something with spirit and int on it, and you can sustain your DPS, and maybe not pull aggro.\n\n\"Then tell the locks to get int and spirit too, waaaaah\" .... its called lifetap, foo, and you don't have it.

Sounds like some of you haven't been to Naxx much. With multiple shadowpriests in the raid (2-3) you gain ridiculous mana regen to multiple groups via both Vamp Touch and Vamp Embrace. Great for mana intensive fights such as Patchwerk or Loatheb. For those claiming that the 21 STA for a warlock is better than the damage gain for the priest translating to double or triple the HPs gained over the course of the fight with VE running on the lock aren't very good at math.\n\nYou can place multiple shadow priests in a tank group for additional regeneration that stacks with everything, useful in nearly every encounter in the game but especially so on Maexxna and Loatheb. \n\nWith multiple shadowpriests, shadowweaving builds to max much sooner, so you are not wasting attacks with low % boosts. This makes a massive difference over the course of many trash mobs as well as maintaining maximum percentage on every boss.\n\nAnd in a pinch the priests can switch to a healing role.\n\nSo saying \"these pants are best for a warlock\" is simply short-sighted. It depends on the build and what you're going for. \n\n\nA decent shadow priest (ie, one that can break 700 damage or drop down to 550-600 damage with great stats) doesn't go OOM in a minute: they downrank mind flay to the point that they can chain it infinitely. In certain situations (especially those where multiple SWP can be ticking at the same time) they dominate everyone, Thaddius for instance where my VEmbrace is healing my entire group for nearly 500hps every second while I'm sustaining 1500dps and not in any danger of aggro or running out of mana.\n\nEven if I was running OOM, I'm basically giving the mana I'm spending to the other casters in the group. Add multiple shadow priests to a single group and you get (nearly) an infinite loop where neither run out of mana. \n\n\nThe only upgrades to these pants for shadow priests are those which have lesser damage with a few more stats but most importantly mana regeneration. If you are in Naxx gear you can easily stack damage and have great stats, getting away with items like End of Dreams and the AV offhand, low stat\/high damage rings, and a no-longer-dropping-in-game high damage shadow wand (which still has yet to be replaced even in TBC for raw topend damage).\n\nRaw topend shadow damage gear with no crit is tailormade for a shadow priest. So exert the eTuffGuy routine as much as you'd like, all it boils down to are people making assertions about what other people are allowed to do in order to make them seem authoritative. Rather lame.\n\n[i][small]Edited, Jan 18th 2007  2:36pm by frottybourreaux[\/small][\/i]","date":"2007-01-18T17:43:22-06:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"frottybourreaux","importedSubject":"Pfft."},{"commentv2":1,"number":31,"id":3072484,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"nerf warlocks","date":"2005-06-08T20:09:23-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Got them today, I still dont know how much DKP it costs.

So you are not using your fire spells, you are using shadowbolt+DoTs to do your raid damage, these legs have more shadow damage than Nemesis Legs, so they can be better depending on your build, However if Nemesis is for set bonuses it would probably be better to chose Nem. \n\nAlso if you are a shadow priest their are a few better leggings to get for dps, WSG exalted Leggings are better for a shadow priest, you will get damage and spirit, Field Marshall\/Warlord leggings if you can grind it (I know a good many guilds who have shadowpriests their shadowpriests have done pvp to get gear)Our shadow priest uses Leggings of the BlackBlizard off Ossirian, wich are much better 40 spell damage +crit and and a few stats, than this and arguable easier to get.","date":"2006-11-18T18:40:11-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ElHaj","importedSubject":"Warlock v Priest"},{"commentv2":1,"number":55,"id":3072508,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"1st off Warlocks should get absolute priority over these pants, they're made for warlocks as they have stamina on them.\nIf all locks in the raid have them priest ofc should get them too.\nSeriusly, it's like robe of the void, for priests it would had diffrent stats as mana regen, spirit and intelect.","date":"2005-11-25T14:59:25-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Shadowpriests need stamina just as much as warlocks. yes mana regen would be nice but I would trade that for humongus damage anyday.","creationdate":"2005-12-29T18:51:51-06:00","id":1282127,"rating":0,"commentid":3072508,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"tindErr","importedSubject":"RE: Warlock \/ Priest?"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Serai","importedSubject":"Warlock \/ Priest?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":56,"id":3072509,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"my guild is raiding naxx (as for right now, we cleared everywing except for dk wing)and those pants are still awsome for even t3 warlocks. especially in patch 2.0, warlock dots gets a lot more spell dam bonus, you wanna stack up as much +shadow as possible, so your corruption can do uber dmg.\n\n in today's patchwerk fight, my highest corruption tick was 500, shadowbolt hit for 2000ish (with shadoweaving, imp shadowbolt and warrior using nightfall, a 2h axe) yet my gear sucks (i have +570ish shadow dmg). i ended up #4 on the damage meter, beat mage, hunter, rogue, fury war, basically those so called\"superior dps class\" (if i remember right i did 201000ish dmg)\n\nfor priest, +21 stam is really for pvp only. if you're wearing gear like this and tome of shadow force, ebony flame glove, you go OOM within a minute. i'm not saying it's not good for priest or priest should just heal, but it def. fits warlock better. more +shadow means more dmg from drain life and siphon life, and warlock get healed more, so we can constantly lifetap. \n\nunfortunately on my server, kazzak has been camped by one alliance guild (even tho we're the most naxx progressive guild, we can't take kazzak over from them) and our guild is not quite motivated to raid kazzak only for those pants, for everything else dropped off kazzak is worthless comparing to bwl and above.","date":"2006-12-15T08:22:57-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"[quote=Xanethewarlock]if you're wearing gear like this and tome of shadow force, ebony flame glove, you go OOM within a minute.[\/quote]\n\nsince the 2.0 patch this is sooo wrong, vampiric touch gives insane amounts of mana back, we´re talking about 1 mp\/5 per 7 spelldamage, meaning 100 mp\/5 for a whole group using a naxx equipped shadowpriest.","creationdate":"2007-01-10T12:03:55-06:00","id":1282128,"rating":0,"commentid":3072509,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"cirrm","importedSubject":"kazzak..."}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Xanethewarlock","importedSubject":"kazzak..."}];

Not to mention a nice stamina boost.<br /><br />NOTE: My original comment was posted BEFORE BURNING CRUSADE<br />So please do not be confused.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9823</b></h3>I'd argue that these are the best pure-damage pants availble to warlocks before the expansion. <br /><br />The massive amount of damage outweighs the lack of spell hit, crit and penetration, which can fairly easily be replaced on other items.<br /><br />Amazing what can be done with focused stats even with this low itemlevel.<br /><br />If you are a warlock, don't miss out on these. You'll replace the rest of your gear before these go, most likely.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dropped off Lord Kazzak, Smolderthorns first Kazzak kill ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually I changed my stance. This is really a nice warlock item, but last time this dropped from Kazzak when my guild+friends killed him, all the locks passed. Only myself and another shadow priest rolled. Think they like the Felheart set bonuses better.<br /><br />Unfortunately I lost the roll.<br /><br />And to the person who said &quot;priests are always primary healers,&quot; for the most part you're right. But when you have nine priests in a Molten Core raid, having all nine heal is just going to be massive overheal and mana waste. Why not get a bit more DPS by having two of them go shadowform and melt faces?<br /><br />That's what we do anyway. =) Pfft, nearly half the time I use Shadowform on trash mobs and easy bosses in MC. I can still clean, still shield, and I add a bit more DPS if there's a lot of priests. With 16 debuff slots, having 4 priests drop Shadow Word on a mob is a pretty good amount of added damage. Also, the Shadow Vulnerability debuff from a shadow priest will increase the damage of any warlock's shadowbolt. Shadow priest and warlock damage overlap nicely.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong though, any time there's fewer than six priests (or we happen to be low on druids and pallies) I put on the +healing gear and spam flash heal just like the Disc/Holy folks.<br /><br />Quote: <i>.. will mean losing warlock for your guild, now just try to do Garr with 2locks o.O</i><br /><br />Pfft, Garr is weaksauce. Killed him several times with only ONE warlock--no wipes, few player deaths. Good tanks ftw.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I kind of agree with redbul. A priest's single target dps does range higher than hunters, warlocks, and ice mages. Sahdow priests were meant to dps that's why their shadow spells do so much base damage and are either instant or have a 1.5 sec cast apposed to warlocks and mages that take a while to do their big spells. Not to mention priests by far get the best damage boosts from talents. 10% from darkness, another 15% from shadow&nbsp; form, and then 3% more keeps adding up to 5 times after that. Since SW:P is most always cast first priests get a 28% increase in damage just from talents alone.<br /><br />I have a priest, hunter, and warlock and I really do think these pants are much better for DPSing priests. Felheart peices are much better for us because of bonuses.<br /><br />In the end though, these are BOTH priest/warlock pants. They are not class specific so no one has a say on who they belong to. It depends on the group, lots of guilds now-a-days have discovered the usefulness of at least one shadow priest in MC/BWL, but not every guild is fortunate enough to have enough priests on all the time to accomplish that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got a lvl 60 priest (holy / disc atm) thinking of going Shadow, i would love thease for my priest, BUT i wouldnt out-bid Warlocks.<br />only if they had something simlar to this. Felheart Pants etc.. and btw, &quot;Shadow Priests&quot; in raids. Vampiric Embrace = 20% heal of all dmg u do. in a 5man group will u be healing just as much as u'll do dmg. so its not totaly wasted on a priest. but i would request Shadow Priests, to go buy &quot;Flarecore Leggings&quot; 21 Stam (same) 16 FR (just a bonus) and then 41 dmg /heal, u will be using the Dmg / heal more than if it were just + dmg. but if u have chance, and NO warlocks need thease, take them, and dont waste 300g or so on Flarecore ;P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Realize that shadow priests when geared well have the most mana-efficient damage spell in the entire GAME.<br /><br />At max rank with some Disc talents, Mind Flay costs 202 mana. With shadowform and my damage set, my mindflay does 782 damage total.<br /><br />782 damage for 202 mana in addition to a very powerful movement-impairing effect.<br /><br />Think about that for a moment. Also, I'm not covered in epics. My damage set has two epics (ritual robes from ZG and sapphiron drape from ony) and even a green!<br /><br />Priests who are far better equipped than me and not dual-specced for both healing and damage could likely eclipse 1k damage mind flays.<br /><br />Shadow priests are one of the best sustained damage dealers in the game, only beat out by rogues and hunters when properly specced, since both of these don't have to rely on mana (although hunters take a DPS hit when they go OOM).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're in a guild worth their salt, you use DKP for rolling on 40-man raid drops. If a Shadow Priest is in the same tier as the Warlocks rolling on it, he has just as much right to it as they do. He earned his DKP and saved it just like they did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a Shadow Priest, and I honestly think Shadow Priests should NOT roll on +Shadow Damage gear that has ONLY Stamina on it. Shadow Priests NEED Intellect as well, since we don't have the ability Life Tap at our disposal like Warlocks do. Gear with nothing but Stamina and +Shadow Damage on it is clearly intended for Warlocks and should never go to a Shadow Priest unless NONE of the Warlocks want it.<br /><br />However, most Priests who see this loot drop are 99.9% of the time going to be in a massive guild that uses DKP to roll for items, and if they've got enough DKP to roll for it, then honestly they've worked for it just as much and deserve it aswell if they truly want it. I know I'd pass to Warlocks first, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Poor close minded people, people like Clexi who only think in one dimension hurt guilds. ;p Nothing against you Clexi but if more people understood priests than they would think differently. We are not like Clerics, our healing isn't nearly as good or as important. I am currently a shadow priest and my guild is on Chromaggus in BWL, I am allowed to raid and am actually always in there. <br /><br />Shadow priests are always overestimated in pvp and always underestimated in pve. It's pretty stupid. The matter of the fact is that high end raiding guilds could all use at least one shadow priest, the dps that comes from a shadow priest is higher than most other classes. I am currently out dpsing every class and I still have blue gear. (only one person I cant out dps and he has high warlord gear)<br /><br />Not trying to hype up priest dps but it's just logic and math. Our burst damage definately sucks but in raiding our mindflay is constant and that is why a shadow priest's dps is way up there, no cast time. With 45% aggro reduction talents shadow priests can bomb on mobs/bosses all day and still not pull aggro.<br /><br />In the end, these pants are great for warlocks and priests. IMO a shadow specced priest who will actually raid as a shadow priest benefits most from these pants because they get the most bonus from it and dont have set pieces that they can obtain to help their spec yet. Simple logic, +damage/healing gear adds to spells, a shadw priest is almost always using mindflay so they are doing constant damage. Constant damge = constant damage bonus. So they are getting more of a bonus that mages/warlocks who need cast times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is what Fel Infused Leggings look like on a female Orc Warlock:<br /><br /><a href="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c191/ChiyomeKitty/fel_leggings.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c191/ChiyomeKitty/fel_leggings.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Both Priest and warlock could use the pants, its simply the one willing to spend the most dkp that gets it. :)<br /><br />Anyway to the people that says that a Shadowpriest have nothing to do in endgame raid's apparently havent tried it, First a shadow priest boost the warlock's sahdow dmg with 15% that alone is quite nice. Other then that a shadow priest is great dps and its quite easy to handel aggro if you are specced correct, 45% thread reduction from talents and fade if you for some reason get aggro anyway, you can even get imp fade buts it should not be needed.<br /><br />Both apparently some people think that priest only works for healing, its like saying that warrior only works for tanking and not dps...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If it was shadow damage and INT maybe, but priests can get better stuff with damage/healing and int that would benifit them more than stam. Stam, however is pretty much the main stat for warlocks so this is DEFINENTLY a warlock over priest scenario.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well even if a priest could do double the DPS of a Lock, I'd still give it up to a lock do regain his health consistently, while doing damage.&nbsp; Short fights &gt; Shadow Priest.&nbsp; Eternally Long Fights &gt; Locks.&nbsp; Overall Locks have less downtime, and good locks will have even less if using all abilities, spells, professions, pots, etc.&nbsp; Its costly to play a good lock I would say, but with that we have a great amount of versatility at our disposal.&nbsp; I like playing as a shadow priest a lot, but same with a mage, I hate drinking after every fight.&nbsp; A Lock can start the next fight at half health and half mana, and end at close to full on both.&nbsp; Drain Tanking FTW.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Kazzak is a big epic vendor, he is such a push over honestly. Once your guild is geared enough its like 30-40 sec fight. Can easily be done with no priest. Im a rogue so I dont care who gets the pants, just saying no priest needed. Pally FTW</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>LOUD NOISES! PRIEST PRIEST PRIEST! LOCK LOCK LOCK! .... who cares? Nice pants, get the ZG Chant and either class would love em. The important part is where they drop, how often, what they look like, and anything that thott may have missed. <br /><br />And when ya get right down to it hunters could really use all that stamina ....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You know, if both shadow priests and warlocks post here saying how good this item is for them, then I say it is safe to say this is a &quot;SHADOW DAMAGE DEALER ITEM&quot; - and not class specific.<br /><br />People seem to take a single item as representative of the rest of a player's gear. If a shadow priest were to have this item, chances are quite good that the *rest* of their gear would be a lot more priest-like and have int and spirit and all that happy stuff.<br /><br />On the warlock side of things, the stats jive nicely with what you would expect a lock to have - simple as that.<br /><br />I've played both and both benefit equally from it. It&nbsp; is just up to your guild / raid to decide if one way or the other would benefit the group more.<br /><br />So in the end, def. a hunter item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Guys...<br /><br />Stop whining about who should get this. It is nice for both, shadow priests and warlocks. A warlock will say warlock prio, a shadow priest will say shadow priest prio. Just have a fair roll. I have a shadow priest, and warlock on myself. They're very nice for both classes. I hope this ends the discussion. If you think a shadow priests wouldn't like them ... than just reroll priest, and talk again when you dinged 60... you will want these pants, believe me.<br /><br />And story's like 'warlocks have prio because....' is no argument to have prio on this item. Shadow priests also get 88% bonus damage from mind flay. and 100% from shadow word: pain, vampiric touch, and shadow word: death</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So much anger from the shadow priests, lol, every piece of loot I look at, I have to look at your whining in the comments. If you are so unhappy, maybe you should play another class, don't take it out on the poor folks just checking the drop rate on an item. Take up quilting, try a sport, I dunno...<br /><br />Now for my 2 cents: Any guild who would let a priest touch these before a lock, I wouldn't join...but from the posts here, it seems alot of people would. If you're guild is short-sighted enough with its loot to let anyone other then a lock get these, perhaps you should find a new guild, I sure as hell would.<br /><br />Answer me this: if you are a shadow priest, trying to do damage on a raid...how long does your very limited MP last you, hmm? All that +damage gear does you no good when you are OOM. Get something with spirit and int on it, and you can sustain your DPS, and maybe not pull aggro.<br /><br />&quot;Then tell the locks to get int and spirit too, waaaaah&quot; .... its called lifetap, foo, and you don't have it. That's why alot of lock gear has only stamina, not so much for PvP, but because we can convert that life into MANA, and keep on DPSing.<br /><br />If your guild is dumb, then leave your guild. My guild has 0, count em, 0 shadow priests, and we are not lacking in ANY way on the damage. Indeed, I might pull aggro alot more in BWL if we had a shadow priest trying to DPS also, with that +shadow damage debuff they throw on the mob. In MC, sure that might fly, but in a 10 minute long, extremely aggro sensitive fight, a shadow priest has no place in the raid...period. And no place wearing gear with +stam and +damage only, rofl.<br /><br />Rant over, flame away nub cakes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a priest, I am a Holy/Disc priest, But why can't everyone just stop complaining about that priests are healinh ONLY! If a priest doesn't want to play a healing specc, it is okey, it doesn't make him a noob... I myself have been shadow from time to time. I do enjoy the dmg I make, but regen suck so I always end up switching back.<br />As for shadowpriests in the raid, they are very very useful... If they are played right, threat reduction talents and Shadowweaving... <br />and the first thing shadowpriests are in the raid for is just shadowweaving, to make WARLOCKS do more dmg. <br />I myself wouldn't mind getting these leggings but if you want full efficiency in the raid, give it to a warlock (If you kill this dude in a guild run), or else let shadowpriests also roll.<br />And one more thing: Shadowpriests in Battlegrounds rocks, Less damage taken and heck alot of more damage done... Only problem is that your mana will run out fast... really fast, which usually is connected to why you die so much...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a shadow priest with +725 damage, I can guarantee these pants are all about one thing: the damage.<br /><br />Stacking STA? Sounds like some of you haven't been to Naxx much. With multiple shadowpriests in the raid (2-3) you gain ridiculous mana regen to multiple groups via both Vamp Touch and Vamp Embrace. Great for mana intensive fights such as Patchwerk or Loatheb. For those claiming that the 21 STA for a warlock is better than the damage gain for the priest translating to double or triple the HPs gained over the course of the fight with VE running on the lock aren't very good at math.<br /><br />You can place multiple shadow priests in a tank group for additional regeneration that stacks with everything, useful in nearly every encounter in the game but especially so on Maexxna and Loatheb. <br /><br />With multiple shadowpriests, shadowweaving builds to max much sooner, so you are not wasting attacks with low % boosts. This makes a massive difference over the course of many trash mobs as well as maintaining maximum percentage on every boss.<br /><br />And in a pinch the priests can switch to a healing role.<br /><br />So saying &quot;these pants are best for a warlock&quot; is simply short-sighted. It depends on the build and what you're going for. <br /><br />A decent shadow priest (ie, one that can break 700 damage or drop down to 550-600 damage with great stats) doesn't go OOM in a minute: they downrank mind flay to the point that they can chain it infinitely. In certain situations (especially those where multiple SWP can be ticking at the same time) they dominate everyone, Thaddius for instance where my VEmbrace is healing my entire group for nearly 500hps every second while I'm sustaining 1500dps and not in any danger of aggro or running out of mana.<br /><br />Even if I was running OOM, I'm basically giving the mana I'm spending to the other casters in the group. Add multiple shadow priests to a single group and you get (nearly) an infinite loop where neither run out of mana. <br /><br />The only upgrades to these pants for shadow priests are those which have lesser damage with a few more stats but most importantly mana regeneration. If you are in Naxx gear you can easily stack damage and have great stats, getting away with items like End of Dreams and the AV offhand, low stat/high damage rings, and a no-longer-dropping-in-game high damage shadow wand (which still has yet to be replaced even in TBC for raw topend damage).<br /><br />Raw topend shadow damage gear with no crit is tailormade for a shadow priest. So exert the eTuffGuy routine as much as you'd like, all it boils down to are people making assertions about what other people are allowed to do in order to make them seem authoritative. Rather lame.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 18th 2007 2:36pm by frottybourreaux</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm really sorry for the priests who wants these. You can have your great PvP excuses, but that doesn't change the fact that Holy/Disc is far superior in PvP compared to shadownoobs. I so much love seeing nub shadowpriests running madly at battlegrounds. No heals for allies = easier victory for the horde ^^<br /><br />So, please do get these pants priests. It forces you to spec shadow and get owned in BG's :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Warlock = Shadow and Fire Damage..<br />Shadow Priest = Shadow Damage..<br /><br />I play a warlock and i'd take the Nemesis pants over these any day. And Warlocks should stop %^&amp;*!ing about priests taking their items because Blizzard made the game WITH shadowpriests in it, aggro reduction talents in the shadow tree would not be there if for raids, etc. And When i see a fellow warlock get 650 dps constantly without getting aggro then perhaps the shadow priest dealing that amount should go holy. Btw, Priests get fade aswell..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Killed Kazzak with 20 ppl or so, 2 of them dropped. We just /rolled for them. A lock won one and me (sp) won the other. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>High end shadow priests really shouldn't roll on these. Being a priest, stamina isn't nearly as important as spirit and intellect, but for a lock it is, due to the magic of lifetapping. Dzaal is totall right.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These droped lastnight from Lord Kazzak, and there was 4 warlocks in the group, I rolled second highest :( <br /><br />Someone named Aidion has them now, Grats to him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To say that only warlocks should get priority on these pants is ridiculous. What are you trying to say? No other class needs stamina except warlocks? Or is it just a case of loot envy and ignorance? Shadow priests should have as much priority on these as warlocks, and if I have the DKP for them they are mine. If the warlocks want to QQ about it, they should complain to blizzard to make these class specific. Go get your Nemesis and shut up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First to get them in Europe.<br />We scouted and killed kazzak just after servers came back after maintanence of the patch day blizzard added these to Kazzak loottable (a few other goodies like ring of spellpower, mana igniting cord has been added in the mc loottable same patch)<br />Also the first piece of item i spent dkp on in my guild :)<br />Remember another warlock saying (probably you will never take them off in your wow life)<br />True.<br />Bas - Clan Skallagrim - Brutality - Burning Blade Europe<br /><br /><a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?720080">http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?720080</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Whoa, I want these so badly. Too bad that we don't have any experience with Kazzak on Horde side of my server :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So, when you turn into that ugly blump of shadow you loose your brain? Is that it? <br />Thoose pants are CLEARLY made for warlocks, and sure.. shadow priests may roll for 'em if it's okay with the warlocks. <br />END OF STORY! /sigh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No longer aquirable! Kazzak has left the building (Azeroth!).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1) Shadowpriests have one spell that gains 44% of the total +damage off this - Mind Blast. Warlocks have Shadow Bolt, 86% of the +damage goes on that. Coupled with the warlock talents for crit chance and Ruin, Warlocks use the +damage to burst. Shadowpriests that try to burst damage make baby jesus cry.<br /><br />2) The remainder of the Shadowpriest spells get +64 damage, but since they are DoT spells, the damage is spread over the whole duration. Warlocks also have DoTs, and more of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Very nice priest leggings, i would love to have those mostly for pvp but also for pve and raiding, For people who say shadow priest dont belong in raiding are right for the most part, but it is always good to have a token shadow priest go with the raids, if you know how to conserve mana and not throw a mindblast everytime it is up that is.... anyways just saying m thoghts and those should deffenitly have no preference one way or the other for priests and Locks to get these pants, as long as they go to good use.And for any person who think shadow priests are so gimp and suck... the name is Nonnel im on whisperwind come meet me outside of Org for a duel and then will talk after that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the story is that shadow priest cant get nemesis and very little legs have +shadow damage or +dmg at all, this ones own! me as shadow priest doing mc bwl could have them and then spend 3 slots on intelect pieces, cuz with these, anathema and prophecy you would have the damage up to 250 or something like that,<br /><br />2 yes shadow priest are useful,maybe more than a warlock, can a warlock heal doing dmg?(or dismiss shadow and heal if priest dies),put shields,dispel,buff,increase shadow 15%, or even tank(i tank in garr 4 example).. if as a warlock u pull agro thanks to priest shadow vulnerability like someone told then u have no idea just stop for a while if u crit for 3000 and done, but its always better to have an option to do more dmg, with priest all warlocks are like tier 3 geared ^^<br /><br />that is of course if you have enough priests in your guild to let 1 being shadow</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My guild who farms MC, BWL some of AQ40 and a Raz in Naxx, we have 1 count them 1 shadow priest. Thats all thats needed on a raid, 1 shadow priest, he heals the warlock group with shadowweaving and increases overall shadow damage in the raid, he is more of a support class giving warlocks more firepower than out to do damage himself. He has a full set of tier 1 for when we are low on healing and he has to step out and heal. No our warlocks do not have a problem with dps, we do it very well often topping the charts, but with a shadow priest we can put out more damage. Being a warlock myself these legs would be better suited for a warlock, as a shadow priest in PvE you wouldnt need solid spell damage, They have stamina, sure everyone needs stamina right? Yes but only to an extent, a shadow priest espicially in PvE isnt going to need a bunch of stacked stamina, a warlock does stack stamina in PvE, also on these legs 64 shadow damage+, wich most PvE warlocks are specced SM/Ruin, at least MC/BWL warlocks. So you are not using your fire spells, you are using shadowbolt+DoTs to do your raid damage, these legs have more shadow damage than Nemesis Legs, so they can be better depending on your build, However if Nemesis is for set bonuses it would probably be better to chose Nem. <br /><br />Also if you are a shadow priest their are a few better leggings to get for dps, WSG exalted Leggings are better for a shadow priest, you will get damage and spirit, Field Marshall/Warlord leggings if you can grind it (I know a good many guilds who have shadowpriests their shadowpriests have done pvp to get gear)Our shadow priest uses Leggings of the BlackBlizard off Ossirian, wich are much better 40 spell damage +crit and and a few stats, than this and arguable easier to get.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1st off Warlocks should get absolute priority over these pants, they're made for warlocks as they have stamina on them.<br />If all locks in the raid have them priest ofc should get them too.<br />Seriusly, it's like robe of the void, for priests it would had diffrent stats as mana regen, spirit and intelect.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>my guild is raiding naxx (as for right now, we cleared everywing except for dk wing)and those pants are still awsome for even t3 warlocks. especially in patch 2.0, warlock dots gets a lot more spell dam bonus, you wanna stack up as much +shadow as possible, so your corruption can do uber dmg.<br /><br /> in today's patchwerk fight, my highest corruption tick was 500, shadowbolt hit for 2000ish (with shadoweaving, imp shadowbolt and warrior using nightfall, a 2h axe) yet my gear sucks (i have +570ish shadow dmg). i ended up #4 on the damage meter, beat mage, hunter, rogue, fury war, basically those so called&quot;superior dps class&quot; (if i remember right i did 201000ish dmg)<br /><br />for priest, +21 stam is really for pvp only. if you're wearing gear like this and tome of shadow force, ebony flame glove, you go OOM within a minute. i'm not saying it's not good for priest or priest should just heal, but it def. fits warlock better. more +shadow means more dmg from drain life and siphon life, and warlock get healed more, so we can constantly lifetap. <br /><br />unfortunately on my server, kazzak has been camped by one alliance guild (even tho we're the most naxx progressive guild, we can't take kazzak over from them) and our guild is not quite motivated to raid kazzak only for those pants, for everything else dropped off kazzak is worthless comparing to bwl and above.</div>
