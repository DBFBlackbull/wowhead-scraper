For many years, he worked diligently throughout the outlying areas of Azeroth, bringing relief to the suffering and swift justice to evildoers.\n\nHe was married to a young girl named Lys in the summer of his eighteenth year.  They were much in love with each other and would eventually produce three children.  A son and two daughters.\n\nMorgan was thirty-two when war broke out in Lordaeron.  Morgan was called to the side of the legendary paladin Uther the Lightbringer to fight against the orcs and the undead.  Leaving his wife and children safety of his home, Morgan left for war.\n\nThe years passed and the war dragged on, and Morgan would witness many horrific events, including the disbanding of the Paladins of the Silver Hand, the death of Uther, and the spread of the plague.  The only thing that kept him from the brink of madness was the knowledge that he would someday be reunited with his wife and children.\n\nMorgan would eventually return to his homeland, but find it nothing like how he remembered it.  The once verdant forest was corrupted and teemed with the undead and other dark forces.
