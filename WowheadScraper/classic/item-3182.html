Better off farming it yourself - even if the area's too low for you to get XP, you get vendor items and free ingredients, which means greater profits and gets you that much closer to that Epic Mount you've always wanted...","date":"2007-02-19T22:08:45-06:00","rating":11,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"It's true that the spider's silk enjoys high demand from tailoring warlock for their robes of arcana, but I think what makes the silk really expensive is the Spidersilk Boots, which is a level 20 rare item that tailors can make with 120 skill.\n\nThe boots typically sell for 4-5 gold on AH on my server.&nbsp; The robes of arcana do as well, but not nearly as often.

I would suggest that you either auction this one off (for around a gold a piece) or keep it if one of your professions is either leatherworking or tailoring. It is used to make both of these rare items:<br />Toughened Leather Gloves (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1411/withered-staff">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1411/withered-staff</a>) and<br />Spidersilk Boots (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=38558">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=38558</a>)<br /><br />Although they are lower level items, the stats are good and they sell for a decent price on the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>30549</b></h3>Anyone mind tipping me and everyone else that reads this where to farm this stuff? I remember picking up a decent amount from the various mobs nearly everywhere listed through my lvling, but failed to take note of its usefulness. <br /><br />Ive been through the north mountain edge of Arathi Highlands for nearly 3 hours and haven't had one drop. Rather aggrivating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;Sometimes certain of these mobs drop like 25/100, and sometimes thottbot says 10% and I kill 50 mobs and don't get any.&quot;<br />The percentage that thottbot gives you is an average counted over droprates that change all the time. Something like dynamic or rotating loot-tables, implemented in mmorpgs to mislead farmers that use tools like thottbot.<br />The only true info is that the spiders in the list all dropped this once and that has been recorded, but it doesnt say it will still drop it at this moment on each server at the exact droprate thottbot says...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Now over the time I've been leatherworking, <i>Toughened Leather Gloves</i> seen to be in near constant demand. Well, the other materials are usually easy, but the Spider's Silk is always the problem. Well, being one who hates relying on others (in this case the Auction House's silk), I have traveled the world of Azeroth searching for it.<br /><br />I have come up with three main hotspots:<br />1. The Deepmoss Spiders up in the Stonetalon Mountains<br />2. The Plains Creepers of Arathari<br />3. Any of the spiders of Ashenvale<br /><br />While I may call these &quot;hotspots,&quot; it can take a long time to gather your silk quota. Its something you have to get used to.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I believe that the best place to loot spider's silk is Hillsbrad Foothills and Stonetalon Mountains.Best drop rates are there.In these 2 areas,I had spider's silk dropped after I had killed 4 to 8 spiders.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found the best place to farm this was South Hillsbrad, around Dun'Garok. The <b>Elder Moss Creepers</b> there dropped one every <u>2-3 kills</u> for me, lvl 28 mage. Quite easy, good for grinding too. Sell for a buttload also so great for tailoring around 120 or lots of cash.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just farmed the 8 i needed for an alt between dabyries farmstean and northfold manor took me 40 mins in that time i got 8 spider's silk and 6 Thick Spider's silk plus was grinding on raptors for medium leather</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have a theory as to why Spider's Silk in particular is so expensive on the AH, and the above comment about economics touches on this.&nbsp; Spider's Silk is an ingredient for Robes of Arcana, something that just about every Warlock will eventually need when they hit Level 30 or so.<br /><br />The pattern for it is relatively difficult to find (especially for Horde), and even then many Lock's are not tailors, so a fair number of Locks need to buy the Robes from the AH or another player.&nbsp; I've seen the Robes on the AH's of various servers with a buyout price of anywhere from 4g to 15g, which can be pretty steep for a Level 30; the reason for the huge price tag is twofold - 1: Locks NEED to get the Robe; that makes it a seller's market so mark-ups are huge. 2: There is a perception in WoW that Locks are rich cuz they don't have to pay for mounts (not actually true - they pay twice as much for new skills as they have to pay for their pet upgrades as well, unlike hunters), and so prices are set by what the sellers feel the market can bear. <br /><br />Anyway, all of that combined with the relative rarity of Spider's Silk dropping means that Spider's Silk will sell for lots of cash - most players know that whoever wants it is going to use it to make an item that they will then sell for huge profits, and so they want to get their share of that.&nbsp; Of course, many &quot;Producers&quot; of said items pass on the production costs, which drives up the sale price of the items, which in turn drives up the component price, and so on.<br /><br />Sort of like selling twink items - you don't sell Level 29 items expecting an actual 29th Level main will buy it - you're selling it to some 70th Level main so they can give it to their 29th Level Twink Alt.<br /><br />Anyway, that's just how it is. My advice? Better off farming it yourself - even if the area's too low for you to get XP, you get vendor items and free ingredients, which means greater profits and gets you that much closer to that Epic Mount you've always wanted...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't see either Spider's Silk or Thick Spider's Silk drops listed for Swamp of Sorrows. This is actually a good place to get them. The spiders are all along the south eastern part of the area, they're lvl40-41, and there is no other mob around except the occasional Shadow Panther (lvl43). They respawn fast, so you can just walk back and forth killing them, and the drop rate is not too bad. There's rarely anyone else in the area, so it may even be pretty decent for PvP servers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Best place to farm for this is in duskwood between Raven hill and the mountain towards Darkshire, most drop off of Black Widow Hatchling's. Just do circles and the spiders will have respawned by time you do a full circle around the ridge inbetween the mountain and raven hill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yup usually closer 1.5g ea on bloodhoof - this is an extremely rare material!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Great thing to farm on Feathermoon server. 0ne starts at about 1G for the most part. I like to farm those wetland spider the most seeing as that's all I can handle and there are ALOT.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone know where the merchant that sells these is located. Thanks in advance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>um i not that great with percentages so cauld anyone plz tell me a good place to farm iam a lvl 35 thnx in advance</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol I feel lucky, 2 off about 5 spiders in Ashenvale, the level 24-25.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>arathi, 125 spiders(+-10) = 3 (!) silk<br /><br />no commends.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got one of these off a spider in Hillsbrad today. I think pretty much all spiders have a chance to drop it...albeit a low percentage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this drops 5% of the time on average. And this could vary depending on the level of the spider.. the higher the level the higher the chance of dropping.<br /><br />THis is NOT worth 75s... Its droprate is actually quite high compared to rare gems like Moss agates.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I farmed for this item from the deepmoss spiders in Stonetalon mountains (the valley with the elite spider in it, besselith i think her name is). The drop rate is slightly lower than the ones found in Arathi, but the mobs are more concentrated and they respawn FAST. got 4 of these after killing 100+ within 30 minutes with my 42 warlock</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I wanted some Spider's Silk so I went to Astranaar and killed only 5, thats right only 5, Wildthorn Stalkers and I got 2 Spider's Silk out of the 5.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, on Stormrage they go for 60s - 1.2g. I'm planning on heading up to Stonetalon, hopefully it won't take more than a few DAYS of grinding to get the silk I need. Anyone on Stormrage looking to unload, feel free to pst Doomgaze and we can deal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just got back from Farming Thelgen Rock in wetlands for Spider Silk.... got 2 stacks in about an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Starts at 1g on shadowsong...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The cost of Spider's Silk at the Horde AH on Dalvengyr isn't too bad (compared to some other servers, I mean) - usually the buyout is somewhere in the range of 75s each.<br /><br />Still, at that price, I'll be spending a day just farming the Spider's Silk, plus I've got a lot of tailoring recipes recently that need it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>how much per 1 spider silk?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Admittedly I wasn't paying much attention at the time but while exploring stonetalon mtns I fought a number of spiders and broke open spider egg sacks that are scattered about on the ground quivering hehe. Got silk of some kind or other off both spiders and from egg sacks. Can also spawn a spider when you break open a sack so be careful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's really hard to grind this stuff... Drop percentages seem to vary widely--sometimes I'll get one every 5 kills, other times I'll kill more than 50 without a single drop. Annoying.<br /><br />And they start at 1G/per on my server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just noticed that it says:<br />Elwynn Forest:<br />Black Widow Hatchling (20 - 25) 6.09% (100791) Green Recluse (20 - 22) 5.14% (23651) <br />Plains Creeper (28 - 33) 9.48% (81125) Pygmy Venom Web Spider (15 - 19) 4.16% (79909) <br />Venom Web Spider (18 - 20) 4.15% (62572) <br /><br />Last time I checked there was nothhing that lvl in Elwynn Forest. For future reference, who should I notify of these types of errors?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay, I am a lvl 58 hunter, OMW to hammerfall in the Highlands i killed several spiders within 5 mins and looted about 7 of these from like 10 spidys so rare i think not, and the only reason they sell for 1G is b/c thats what overpricing noobs charge. OMG it's Spider silk, something used in alot of lowbie gear. Get a clue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got 4 of these for my Spidersilk Boots in just 20 minutes grinding in Stonetalon Mts. I'll definitly be farming for some more there sometime soon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just grabbed 4 from 'Thelgen Rock Cave' (53,63) in the wetlands, Lev 26 warlock, all spiders around lev 22... I got the 4 just going in and out in one trip.<br /><br />Killed all spiders twice so about 60 spiders I guess, so approx a 15% drop rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Spider silk is a money maker. I am on Daggerspine and I list them with a 1G buyout and they sell so fast I cna't believe it. <br /><br />I love when I find one on a drop....it's money in the bank.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got one off a spider in Elwynn Forest recently, admittedly I was quite surprised.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i sold 20 of these for one gold now i feel stupid =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>25s nothin, Kil'Jaeden its 50s at least, its rediculous...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate is rediculous for this item, considering how many you need for tailoring. I'm working on getting my Enchanted Gold BloodRobe and I need just 2 pieces of Silk so my tailor can make the Robes of Arcana. <br /><br />I've killed a few hundered Creepers now and only have 1 silk to show for it. I have standing order with friends not to sell/trade/auction any they find. One of the more painful pieces to procure.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zedwards</b></h3>Haven't seen these drop in Arathi or Hillsbrad in classic. The Wetlands cave has been the most successful.</div>
