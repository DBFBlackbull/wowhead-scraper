<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheOnyx</b></h3>These items can also be looted from snow piles. One example of these snow piles is in the Arathi Highlands, inside the elite ogre camp. You'll see little piles of show all around. These piles of snow drop 3-5 snowballs each and have a relatively fast respawn rate. These snow piles only appear during the Christmas event.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sware</b></h3>You can get Hardpacked Snowballs in Alterac Valley battlegrounds, whats special about these snowballs you can throw them at enemy players, it knocks them back, far.<br /><br />I sometimes knock players through the portal and it kicks them out of the BG</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8763</b></h3>These are littered all over the ground in the Alterac Mountains. It's very fun to throw at people, particularly if they are in your party. If you throw a snowball at someone in your party, it will know them down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10081</b></h3>I've been doing too much AV the last 4 wks and have 4/5 Warlord's Pursuit set. When ppl on my team started using the snowballs to throw me off the bridge, I got pissed. Then, I started doing it and found it to be a lot of fun. Bottom line is have fun its a just a game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sware</b></h3>Hotfix details:<br /><br />- Regular snowballs will no longer knock down groupmates in a Battleground. This only applies to Battlegrounds. The reason for this is that grouping is forced in the Battlegrounds and players were using the mechanic to cause grief to their teammates. <br /><br />- &quot;Hardpacked Snowballs&quot; -- specific to Alterac Valley -- can only be used against enemy targets. Again, the reason for this was due to negative player issues caused between teammates in Alterac Valley.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What are snowballs good for?&nbsp; Throw them isn't a good description.&nbsp; Do they have any effects / use,&nbsp; or are they just for fun?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I grabbed some of these out of AH and had a great time with them tagging passerbies... but the question is, where can you find more?<br /><br />I realize that engineers with that schematic can make them, but it claims snowballs are a vendor/drop item, what vendors have them?&nbsp; What drops them?&nbsp; No info of such things is given =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Both the design and the snowballs were for christmas only. There was a vender in org, and just about ever other major city selling them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These things do have a chance in MC. Nothing like a little ice breaker while waiting for a pull. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can buy from vendor -.-<br /><br />BTW, Nice bug involving having a party member throwing a snowball on you just when flying any path.. If you throw in the right time you get teleported to the place you choosed and gets the knockdown effect&nbsp; :D<br /><br />so for example: <br />Invite someone, beg them to spam-throw snowballs (they cost 9c / 5 snowballs) and start fly to like tanaris from orgrimmar, takes years, with &quot;snow-ball technique&quot; you get teleported :)<br /><br />GG blizzard! ^^ <br />PS: Use in raids to throw on an unsispicious healer and look how the raid turns to a 40man snowballfight!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I find them to still be profitable. I bought a bunch. At the original 10c each I got a 20-stack for 2silver. Just a few weeks ago I sold that 20-stack at the auction house for 55silver. And lots of other people were asking a similar price too.<br /><br />They are useful for other crafting skills, so people will pay good money when they're out of season.<br /><br />I think last year they resold for about twice what they are now, but hopefully it'll go up the farther away from winter we get...</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
