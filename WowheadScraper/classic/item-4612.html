I was thinking along the lines of something like frost oil (a one time thing that last for x amount of time). One time use item, but enchantment style... It sucks if you get new weapons often though :\</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Even though the quest says Elite , the heart drops from the whelps as well as the Bigger elite ones.<br />I got mine for my rogue&nbsp; from killing whelps about 2 months ago, now im getting ready to get it agian with my hunter. <br />Guild mates got them from the Whelps also, SO i can conform whelps drop them. Just have to kill then , alot , or get lucky on the first few kills.<br />Peronsally, unless your going to farm the Dragonscales, heavy and thick leahter, and fire gizzards, this quest isnt worth the time. The fiery enchant is an AOE dmg, and if your in a group, your not going to want that, becuase it will break mezzes/sheeps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I believe you are the weighing factor in the drop rate. <br /><br />2 people get the heart instantly, that means you should have to kill approximatly 300+ to find one.<br /><br />Look at the 0.6 drop rate and think about what I just theorized.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b><br />I believe 80% of these kills must be from players who do not have or have already done the quest. Therefore killing them will not drop this item and throw off the true drop rate.<br /><br />I would say the drop rate is approx:<br />2.3% - 12%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, I was doing this quest and killed appoximately 12 dragons.&nbsp; Then, I decided to come here to check the drop %.&nbsp; After seeing it's low drop, I checked the comments, and found a suggestion to loot immidiatly after the dragon's death.<br /><br />So, I did. And, 6 kills later, it dropped.&nbsp; Thats better odds than aroudn 1 in 140 or so.<br /><br />The thing is, even if this technique doesn't work... It's still worth the trouble to try.&nbsp; It worked for me and many others, and the clues add up.<br /><br />Try it&nbsp; =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In reference to the drop rates, note that the Black Drake's Heart is a quest item. That means that it will only drop for, or be visible to someone who has the quest. Since Scalding Whelps are good for farming if you want Dark Whelpling or small flame sac, it's logical that people have done these mobs without the quests, and it's probably been done a lot, thus horribly skewing the numbers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A quest item with such a low drop rate?... This is stupid. I'll prolly end up with a dark whelpling before I get this damn heart!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>...or why you should always read allakhazam first.<br /><br />Seeing it was a lvl 45 elite quest, I assumed that it must drop off some elite dragons. Prowled in, found the scorched guardians at the back, selected the highest level elite there (44) and attacked. Starfire, Wraith, Moonfire, Faerie Fire, Dire Bear, Demoralising Roar, Bash, Maul Maul Maul Maul, Human, Healing Touch, Faerie Fire, Moonfire, Dire Bear, Demoralising Roar, Bash, Maul Maul Maul Maul die with 1% to go on Dragon. :/<br /><br />So on my way back as a wisp from the other side of the Badlands I check the site, and find that it doesn't even necessarily drop from them anyway. Rez, select nearest whelp, kill it.... omg, pick up the heart. <br /><br />That's right, first whelp I kill.<br /><br />Maybe they've upped the drop rate.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Have killed well over 60 with no drop. I am lvl42 rapidly nearing 42 have made around 30K xp so far. But this is trying my patience. (just got it at 79 kills)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GnomeTBC</b></h3>It took an hour, so 0.4% chance of drop seems to be right.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Killigann</b></h3>I lost count pretty early on, but it went like this: I killed maybe a dozen or more and then used a round of my favorite pots. An hour later the pots ran out and I killed another dozen or so, hoping for the best. Downed another round of my pots and was thinking about unbooning my wb's that I was saving for Uldamon to speed the process up. Finally dropped after 7 minutes into my second round of pots. I would say in the neighborhood of 100 mobs, so the 1% drop rate seems to be accurate. <br /><br />There are comments about the droprate getting skewed because the item only drops for ppl with the quest, but... most ppl on these mobs are there for the quest so... I don't think it's very skewed. Iike I said took me around 100 kills for 1 drop. Lots of leather and vendor goods, no blues/greens. Not a fun grind either tbh. <br /><br />btw, The fiery enchant reward is s/b but useless for a caster. You can enchant a weapon with it without it getting s/b, so you can mail the enchanted weapon to an alt or put it on ah</div>
