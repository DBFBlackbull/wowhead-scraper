Well specced and geared they can do pretty fair DPS, can heal or cleanse (often beating druids and priests in healing meters, though not the best gauge of merit this), and they can tank. Some say they can't, but they can tank nearly as well as a warrior in right gear, specced right and know what they are doing. And please note I say that as a warrior talking about a paladin. Their issue is they use fair mana to do that job, and hence down time makes them not as effective as tanks, and they can't generate the agro quite as well as a true warrior, but they can do the job.\n\nAs for the blade... Well it would work for fury warriors, though personally I say it's better for a rogue.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2874</b></h3>Garr Abilities:<br /><br />Each time an add dies, Garr gets a buff to his attack speed and damage.<br /><br />Garr has an AOE that dispells all the raid's buffs and also slows movement speed.<br /><br />Whenever one of the adds is about to die, it explodes, causes massive AOE damage to everyone around it, and sends them all flying.<br /><br />Eventually Garr starts sacrificing the adds, causing them to explode even if you aren't killing them.<br /><br />Garr's a Shaman. He snares, he purges, he bloodlusts when his friends die.<br /><br />Garr Set-Up:<br /><br />Have a Paladin pull Garr with Divine Shield or have the Warrior use a bow pull.<br /><br />Four of Garr's adds should be banished by Warlocks. Assign targets beforehand. You may find that having a Warlock only banish the adds is better than trying to have them multi-tasking (DPS and banish).<br /><br />The remaining four adds need to be tanked and killed. Kill them one by one, making sure that the melees step away before they die, as each explodes upon death. They must be tanked relatively close to Garr, as they deal more damage if they are far away<br /><br />Kill Garr after the four adds. After Garr is killed, the other adds must be killed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If this weapon drops again in one of my raids it should go to ME. Nevermind what class I am, because that's not what's important here. If I'm a warrior and I want this weapon, it's not because I'm a warrior, it's because I, capital I, want the weapon. Frankly, I would be just as angry to see it go to another person of my class as I would to see it go to anyone else present aside from myself. For my part, if I lose, I really don't care if it ends up in a rogue's/warrior's hands, or in a warlock's hands. The only benefit I can see in it going to a rogue or warrior is that the third time it drops that is two less people to compete against instead of one.<br /><br />I think everyone who has posted here so far, deep down, feels exactly the same way, and should just shut up. We're all selfish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Brutality Blade + <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37469">Core Hound Tooth</a> both w/ + 15 agi enchants make the best hunter set in the game. Yes rogues can use it just as much.<br /><br />Here is a way to look at this, so you can comprehend it, hunters want Brutality blade and core hound tooth, yes hunters do melee, whether you want to believe it or not, and they make just as much use as a rogue. However, rogues will take <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=27150">Striker's Mark</a> and not think twice about it, because they can use the stats &quot;just as much as a hunter&quot;, yet they'll probably never shoot it.<br /><br />In short, hunters will use DKP on Brutality blade and Core hound tooth, just rogues will use DKP on Striker's Mark. I dont blame either class for doing it.<br /><br />My personal perferance for rogues would be <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=36280"> Gutgore Ripper</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37469">Core Hound Tooth</a>. Rather use swords, and not some of your most damaging skills? be my guest, its your loss.<br /><br />Dual wielding isn't really a good option for a warrior, most likely they'll have sword/board combination or a 2hand weapon for MS. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=35887">Quel'Serrar</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=27683">Drillborer Disk</a> or 2hand <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=39565">Obsidian Edged Blade</a> are prime examples.<br /><br />Paladins would use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=28233">Aurastone Hammer</a> or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37426">Finkle's Lava Dredger</a>, most likely. Or some other mana/heal boosting items.<br /><br />I could go on listing weapons for each class, but I dont see the need to. And dont bring of this crap about rolling on items, as you'll probably never do MC anyway. Guilds use DKP for a reason.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this last night and as a warrior I have some mixed feelings about taking this from the rogues.&nbsp; Quel is a better option for tanking, but try as I may, I have been unable to get the book to drop.&nbsp; I am a sword speced warrior, and there simply are no other good sword options out there that are within my grasp.&nbsp; Sure BWL has some and the new world dragons, but my guild is still working on downing Ragnaros atm.&nbsp; Those drops are far far from anything I will have access to for a while.&nbsp; With this upgrade I generate rage much quicker which really helps me tank, so hopefully in turn I can hold aggro better and keep those rogues alive. *wink*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To the person above who suggested that rogues bugger off and go get daggers, please realize that not all rogues use daggers. Some combat spec'd rogues are sword specialized. For those types of rogues, daggers do not take advantage of all their talents, and as a result, this weapon is superior to a comparable dagger for them. The 1% crit is very nice, but the other stats are great for a rogue, too: agi adds to chance to crit, chance to dodge, attack power, ranged attack power and armor; strength adds to attack power. Personally, as a sword specialized rogue, I'd place this weapon in the main hand, because to the best of my knowledge, abilities like Sinister Strike and Eviscerate figure the damage for crits based on the top damage, even though speed is now taken into account to balance that a bit. Ideally, I'd use something like a Blackgaurd or the offhand from the set in ZG in the offhand slot for it's speed ... comparable dps but you hit much more often giving you the chance to lay down more poison and up your sustained damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I love this wep combo on my rogue<br /><a href="http://img288.imageshack.us/img288/5504/vals3co.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img288.imageshack.us/img288/5504/vals3co.jpg</a><br />Brutality Blade Left, Gutgore Ripper Right</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To all Rogues, Hunters and Warriors who claim this weapon: When and if you ever actually see an end-game instance you will realize that A. All of these classes can make a legitamate claim to this and many other items. There are many that overlap multiple classes in thier use. B. That every class that can use an item will have equal opportunity to aquire it because C. end game guilds use DKP which mean you can $%^&amp;* all you want about how it should go to your class because chances are if you are not getting it, it is because someone who attends raids more often than you and therefore has more DKP than you is getting it instead. I can garuntee that person is more important to your guild than you are, 1. Because no one likes whining crying noobs on raids and 2. because they earned those points with thier attendance which makes them a valuable plyer to thier guild. In the case of this blade we have four of them on our regular raiders in my guild a Fury Warrior, Two Rogues and a Hunter, they are all awesome players they all deserve it, they all make good use of it and NO ONE complained when they got it, even the rogues said &quot;grats&quot;. And BTW a Hunter is next in line and I personally hope he gets it soon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am at work and am extremely bored, thus I have been looking through all the epic weapons in the game that a hunter would use (and I haven't even looked at daggers b/c I always pass to a rogue that needs).&nbsp; I am a 60 hunter and our guild just started MC 2 weeks ago and we are already halfway through it, so I thought I should start deciding what to save my DKP for.&nbsp; <br /><br />Warriors, unless you are in a guild that has MC down to farming status with all your rogues and hunters epiced out, this is only a PvP weapon for you and you shouldn't be &quot;rolling,&quot; that is the guild leader should give first DKP dips to rogues and hunters.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rogues, this is a great sword for a sword spec rogue and I have no problem with a rogue rolling on this, however if your guild can do all of MC and has started doing BWL, you can get better.&nbsp; Unless this is a big upgrade I would save your DKP and pass to a hunter in your guild that wants it.<br /><br />Before you flame me, I offer this challenge.&nbsp; Find a better 1h weapon in the game for a hunter. With the agil, stam and crit, along with the relatively slow speed for a 1h weapon, this is the best.<br /><br />I understand most warriors and rogue &quot;get more use&quot; out of these weapons, but you want certain ranged weapons for the ONLY the stat bonuses, you have no practical use for them.&nbsp; Hunter use melee weapons for both bonuses for ranged, and b/c we have to melee more than you think.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Before someone points it out, yes I know the Grand Marshall weapons are better, but 99.99% of players don't have the time to get that rank, while any good player with a good guild has a chance of seeing that drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes i to thoguht that but he is rather sure about it, myself (If i was Fury warrior) would prolly have taken the Hakkari blades</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The best weapon combo in game for hunters is Warblade of the Hakkari main hand and Fang of the Faceless off hand. FACT!<br /><br />They both haved good DPS for melee AND give the best possible ranged DPS boost out of any weapons even into BWL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this on my warrior in MC on St. Patty's day.<br /><br />we had a huge debate over this. rogues, hunters, warriors wanted.<br /><br />In MC, no one cares about you. sorry. they lean forward on the edge of their seats to find out if you had fun in WSG.&nbsp; Its all about strengthening the raid.<br /><br />a raid with melee classes using epic melee weapons and hunters with epic bows will go alot farther than warriors with epic bows and hunters with epic weapons.&nbsp; Common sense. <br /><br />A hunter almost got this sword.&nbsp; The warriors and rogues threatened to save DKP and buy every single epic ranged weapon that dropped.&nbsp; <br /><br />This made it clear: hunters NEED bows, warriors and rogues NEED melee weapons.&nbsp; Hunters, you need swords too, but you DONT have priority.&nbsp; Warriors need bows too... but we DONT have priority.&nbsp; You need to work together and not be so god damn $%^&amp;ing selfish and clueless. Items should be distributed to strengthen the guild and promote success, NOT because people want to be loot !@#$%s, enough said, thank you, good @#$%ing bye.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So every time I come to thottbot to check on an item, I am seeing the same pattern. Morons who dont know how to play their class, like the hunter above, who thinks its ok to bid on a sword like Brutality Blade because of its STATS. OMFG LEARN TO PLAY UR CLASS U NOOB. First of all u dont &quot;roll&quot; on epics that drop in MC, u bid DKP. Second of all, you will never get to MC unless u were in a guild that kinda knew what they were doing, and letting a hunter get this sword before a rogue is a sign of a guild that will prolly be running UBRS for a while longer, lol. Please dont post unless you know what ur talking about son. How can u even think of depriving a rogue from one of the best swords in the game so u can have some &amp;*!@ing stats? A rogues dps would increase greatly with a sword this slow and a combat build u idiot, and he will use it for a whole lot more than just &quot;stats&quot;. And for those who say &quot;Hunters need to melee when we pvp or solo or w/e&quot; GUILD RUNS ARE NOT HERE TO GEAR YOU FOR PVP. When u are in MC,&nbsp; u are gearing members so u can tackle harder bosses, not gearing u so u can do BG, lol. If u need pvp gear so #$%^ing much run WSG, lol. Anyway noob, unless ur raid leaders are total&nbsp; idiotic noobs this sword always goes to a rogue first.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ummm....yeah, Im going to have to agree with Kezool 100%. Yes this is a rogue weapon and a hunter who bids on it before a rogue should prolly be dibbed in hot oil and banned from game. More important though is : Why are u getting so upset and calling people noobs and morons? The above scenario (hunter bidding on this sword) almost never happens. Guys, I have run MC countless times and I have prolly seen this swrord like 30 times, lol. And every time it drops there was no drama and no arguements. The rogues got to bid first. We have 3 combat rogues in our guild, and when they got it, fury warriors started wanting it, lol. Which is ok since rogues got the sword, and it made sense that fury warriors got it after rogues, even though most are two-hand weapon weilders. So, please be respectful of one another. have fun.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>People always talking about rolling on certain items in MC.&nbsp; Anyone that actually goes to MC would know that leaders put class priority on almost all non class specific items.&nbsp; Brutality WILL and DOES start off as a rogue ONLY item, BB + Vis'kag = amazing dps for rogues.<br /><br />My guild has recently opened BB to hunters...now if rogues still want it bad enough, they will bid dkp to what it is worth to them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Guys, a hunter would never bid in this item over a rogue, plain and simple. I dont know who you have been playing with but no raid leader will allow anyone to get this sword before a rogue. It is a rogue sword and it will up a rogues damage by alot. And 99% of hunters that Ive raided with know this very well, I feel bad that u guys have been raiding with greedy &amp;*!@#$%s. Even fury warriors get 2nd dibs on sword. Rogues first, then fury warriors, then hunters. If you are in a guild that allows a hunter/warrior bid on this before the rogues have it, u should /GQUIT, but it never really happens cause most raid leaders will assign this to a rogue first, unless they are idiots. BTW I am a HUNTER not a rogue so im not being biased, i have just been playing this game for like years now, and Ive always seen this sword go to a rogue first. Cheers</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Guys, no hunter will ever bid on this sword before a rogue. Rogues ALWAYS have dibs on this. I have never seen a hunter bid on it, AND if they really wanted it then they can just wait till sword rogues in the guild had it. U cant screw a rogue from one of the best swords in the game so u get a 1% crit and +9 agility u greedy noobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These kinds of discussions always occur regarding weapons the appeal to more than one class, and the Brutality Blade is one of those weapons. On one hand it has great stats for a hunter or even a warrior, and on the other hand it is a slow weapon with good upper-end damage which is great for Sinister Striking, which rogues spam throughout a fight. Its really a matter of who can put it to more use guys. This is not the same as &quot;hunter rolled on a green leather chest piece cause he liked the stats&quot;. This is end game stuff guys. Items here, even though not clearly specified, are actually much better in the hand of one class than in anothers. Yes, it would be GOOD for a hunter to have this, but....it will be GREAT in the hands of a combat rogue, plain and simple. I know it sux, but this far in the game you just have to take it. This is a rogue weapon. I think most hunters already understand this, but for those who still think they should get this before a rogue cause they have more DKP...you are wrong. I am actually the raid leader of &lt;Gods of Vigor&gt; on Firetree, and I have made it very clear before this thing even dropped,&nbsp; that sword rogues will have priority on this, because it will make the guild raids stronger as a whole, and thats the main point. In return, I would NEVER allow a rogue to bid on Strykers Mark regardless of how much DKP he has. I would give the bow to hunter with 10 DKP before I give it to a rogue with 1000 DKP. I know that hunters do have to melee sometimes, but if you are doing it in guild raids, like MC,&nbsp; then something is really wrong. Sorry to burst some bubbles guys, but dont give up, most guilds usually open this to hunters and warriors for bidding after its dropped a couple of times, so just be patient, and if you want it bad enough, you will surely get it.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if a hunter would bid on this it would be same as a rogue bidding on Striker's Mark-wrong and moronic</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah from what Ive seen, this sword goes to a rogue first since it is too slow for a dps warrior. Rogues need slow high damage weapons becuase thier instant attack sinister strike depends on the high-end damage. <br /><br />An example of a noob rogue who doesnt know how to play his class is one that bids on fast swords for their main hands. I have seen this happen before in ZG when hakari warlblade dropped and a rogue wanted it. I was raid leader, and I decided it should go to a fury warrior first since he will put it to much better use. So this is the simple rule of thumb that most raid leaders follow: <br /><br />Slow swords --&gt; Rogues First<br />Fast and high dps swords --&gt; DPS Warriors First</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sword rogues always have first priority on this, followed by fury warriors, and finally hunters got to bid on it. This sword drops so often though that within 2 months everyone who wanted it got it! We had 5 drops in 2 months! So play nice, and be patient. You will get it if your guild is farming MC. It just looks stupid when u have a fury warrior in your guild wielding this before the sword rogues</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>there is no need for a warrior to have this its called quelsars<br /><br />1st: quel'serrar<br />2nd: quel'serrar is a tanking weapon and crap for a dw fury warrior<br />3rd: this baby is a fury warriors just like it is a hunters or a rogues</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a member of a guild with MC also on farm and many entrances and kills in BWL, and as a warrior, top level guilds always have more than one fury spec warrior on there runs.<br /><br />Most bosses dont need 6 prot spec tanks.&nbsp; They need a couple, and then warriors that can either grab and hold aggro, or out DPS rogues.<br /><br />Fury specs are capable of doing just that, and do not die nearly so fast.<br /><br />Big fury gear, aka HoER, Onslaught-G, Fire-w hands, Drake talon sholds, sentinal or titanic, or conquerors legs, etc, and crul'shoruk, this, or a deathbringer, and these huge DPS Fury specs are perfect.&nbsp; With a few of these guys, 1. rogues will be out dps'ed, ive seen it with comp geared rogues consistently, <br />2.&nbsp; Bosses will die<br />3.&nbsp; Said fury Tanks have seperate gear to help grab aggro and diffuse incoming dps.</div>

Wearing no armor and having no ranged abilities, rogues live and die by their little 1h weapons. Let them have weapons like these, or at least let it go to a 1h shield warrior. Hunters and paladins who think melee damage is what they are there to do should stick to using the more easily attainable and amazing 2h weapons in the game.</div>

The dps difference on those weapons are around 10..<br /><br />What I'm saying is that this sword is excellent for agility rogues, but its not perfect for attack power rogues. Although it's pretty much awesome when soloing as you'll have to have FULL attackpower gear in order to get the Krol Blade to exceed the Brutality Blade's damage, and theres some excellent stats on the Brutality Blade that I wouldnt ant to miss. :)<br /><br />If only rogues could use axes.. deathbringer sinister strikes would be like doing sinister strikes with Doomsaw ^^.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You are correct, the top end damage on Krol Blade with sinister strikes will hit harder than this weapon. This does not account for how much weapon damage you increase in melee. A good sword rogue will keep Slice and Dice pumping throughout an entire raid. The 10 dps increase on this for melee will easily offset the slightly harder sinister strike damage. I have this weapon, and Dal'Rend's Set, this does more damage over time by a considerable margin. If you are only worried about your one big hit, then you should be a dagger rogue, if you want to do more damage over time, get a clue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The bottom line on this is that it is a nice sword. If I got more DKP then you, I could care less if you out damage me by a billion, I'll still own it. I play for me and my char, not you and your dps or your char. Sure I may be selfish, but I pay my 15 bucks a month not anyone else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>awesome sword for fury wars. cant wait to get mine. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For quite a while, I've been trying to get the Hakkari offhand from Bloodlord in ZG, but after 8 kills, and no offhand, I decided to spend my DKP on a Brutality Blade. Just happend to drop off Garr the other night, so I picked it up. <br /><br />The Hakkari Manhand + Brutality Blade is a pretty kick ass duel wield for hunters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I find it funny when I read the rubbish some people write, like paladins suck, warriors suck etc etc.<br /><br />None of the classes suck, and you can use them all well if you aren't a noob at playing it and choose the RIGHT gear for the RIGHT spec. I mean I've seen people saying I beat a warrior wearing might and using Quel'Sarrar in his MH... well no wonder.. crap gear and weapon for doing damage.<br /><br />Also, paladins aren't a fill in class in MC or other places. Well specced and geared they can do pretty fair DPS, can heal or cleanse (often beating druids and priests in healing meters, though not the best gauge of merit this), and they can tank. Some say they can't, but they can tank nearly as well as a warrior in right gear, specced right and know what they are doing. And please note I say that as a warrior talking about a paladin. Their issue is they use fair mana to do that job, and hence down time makes them not as effective as tanks, and they can't generate the agro quite as well as a true warrior, but they can do the job.<br /><br />As for the blade... Well it would work for fury warriors, though personally I say it's better for a rogue. As a warrior you're better with something a tad faster that generates your rage quicker and makes use of other fury talents. Heck, don't pass it up if you don't have something better, as its still a cracking tool.<br /><br />Either way, I never get teh crap about classes, as all are useful in end game instances, and only noobs that haven't been in any mouth off about some class or other being worthless in them.</div>

So, why bring sword rogues to MC and not more warriors? warriors have more hp, more armor, more FR. <br /><br />Dagger rogues do more damage than anything.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>One would imagine a sword rogue had a clue about damage. Let me fill you in a little bit. Your Krol Blade is 10 dps lower than this. Even with 1200 atk power buffed up you wont out damage this.<br /><a href="http://www.geekboys.org/wow/damage.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.geekboys.org/wow/damage.php</a><br />Krol Blade 1114 top crit<br />Brutality Blade 1098 top crit<br /><br />Thats 26 damage per SS at max crit with 1200 atk power. The only way Krol would be better would be if you sat at 100% crit, and every mob you ran into had 0 armor. Other than that, you are not beating the 10 dps increase, and additional 9 agi/str that is brought to the table by this blade. You have to remember that you weapon swings account at a bare minimum 1/3 of your overall damage in a raid. Thats the &quot;white damage.&quot;</div>
