<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Salali</b></h3>Correct.<br /><br />The pet's original name for the first approx. year, was Maine Coon, however the pet actually looks nothing like a maine coon and it is rumored certain people were &quot;offended&quot; by the name of the pet (a coon). Unfortunately, they are no longer sold for 100 gold+ but their 'companionship' is unmatched.<br /><br />EDIT: While it is true a black tabby pattern can be found on some maine cats, the most common color of a maine coon is brown.<br /><br /><b>Links</b><br /><ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia - Maine Coon</a></li><li><a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=Maine+Coon&amp;btnG=Search+Images&amp;gbv=2" rel="nofollow">Google Images - Maine Coon</a></li><li><a href="http://www.mainecoons.org" rel="nofollow">Maine Coon Information, etc.</a></li></ul></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well maine coon always used to get stuck in the swear filter - coon being a derogatory term for a black person</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You now have a nice screenshot of my pet ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can get these from mobs by dalaran inside the building and around the building (Dalaran is a huge purple buubble north west of tarren mill for all u noobys out there =P)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ran through Ambermill on my orc hunter alt just 20 minutes ago on my way to Hillsbrad. Lo and behold; the Dalaran Spellscribe was up! Managed to kill her even though I had massive lag spikes at the time, and she (it was a she this time, the Spellscribe can be either gender when it spawns) dropped this darling.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I should keep it or sell it. xP</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Go to Ambermill, go inside the main walls and you'll see a town hall type thing straight ahead.<br />On your left there is a little house, the guy/gal spawns in there.<br />Another spawn point is in the big house at the back downstairs. Also it can spawn in town hall.<br /><br />Have one for sale - Thuban, ally side - EU Emerald Dream<br /><br />edit - sold for 30g on AH straight off, but I may get another one so send in game mail if interested</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is a &quot;Black Tabby&quot; cat that walks around Exodar.&nbsp; It's about the size of an actual Maine Coon; it's huge and level 60.&nbsp; Does anyone know if that's the size of the actual pet?<br /><br />Blizzard did change the name because it's considered to be profanity to some, a racial slur.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Renamed &quot;Black Tabby&quot; as of 1.6</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On my Horde alt, (Krahldar) I saw it on the Auction House for 3 gold and 30 silver. I instantly got on my level 28 troll (Hectaa) and sent the gold to him. I bought it, and tried to sell it but the best offer I got was 5 gold, so I used it. It's a cute kitten :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Best thing about this pet is that the Blizzard curse filter removes the name of this when you try to talk about it in channels... :) So it becomes a Maine $%^&amp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've killed the spellscribe about 10 times now. Then I look and someone's selling the cat on the AH for 50g. Blizzard is cruel. If it drops, at least I'll use it, not sell it to the highest bidder. Anyhow, I'll let you know how many times I have to farm this rare to get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have put this cat up for sale at the Booty Bay AH with a starting bid of 25g, and buyout of 40g.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have never heard of this cat till someone put it up on the AH.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>too abd i cant get this as allaince, have to go buy it i guess, oh well</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>almost used it because I thought it was useless. I put it up on AH for 15G and was almost instant buyout... later I found out this thing can go for up to 50!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well wow, I had no idea this was such a rare thing. I got it from Dalaran and sold it for 1g 50s. ah well, easy come easy go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For sale on the magtheridon server at the booty bay auction house.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I actually created a horde character just so I could sell this on the neutral AH to my Alliance character.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No longer available by me on magtheridon sold to what i assume is an alliance toon for 35g at BB AH.</div>

Just a drop in Silverpine, I think.<br />Didn't know what it was so I clicked it and out comes this little grey cat, it just follows after you.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>killed spellscribe 6 times total, the first five were males the last was a female and she dropped it. farming for this is easy since no one ever goes to it.
