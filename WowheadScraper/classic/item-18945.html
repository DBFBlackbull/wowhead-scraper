Turn in to Master Smith Burninate (go Trogdor and Homestar) at Thorium Point in sets of 4.<br /><br />From 0 rep at friendly to honored status will take 960 residues.<br /><br />They only drop from mobs in BRD, ask your party members if they mind helping you out and contributing their share of residues. Maybe offer 1s a piece to help defray repair costs for them when they get out of BRD.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Speak to Master Smith Burninate at the new Thorium Point town, do the quest to get the plans from he cauldron. After that, he gives a repeatable quest that gives 25 rep per turn in (at lvl 60). The repeatable quest requires 4 Kingsblood, 2 Incendosaur scales (from the Incendosaurs in the lava area inside the Cauldron) and 1 coal. This quest is from Nuetral to Friendly.<br /><br />Once you are friendly with the Thorium Brotherhood, the repeatable quest changes to 4x Dark Iron Residue, which will bring you up to Honored. So stock up on the residue, you'll need a LOT.<br /><br />I myself just finished grinding hundreds of Incendosaurs tonight to get to Honored, thank goodness I bought hundreds of Kinsblood before the patch went live and it was still cheap :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>gaining faction gives you access to certain items available through certain members of the thorium brotherhood, such as the dude in BRD tavern. I know he offers plans to weaponsmiths (dark iron reaver) and armorsmiths (dark iron bracers and leggings), but i'm not sure about plans for other professions.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>how many times i have to do that quest (1 coal, 2scales, 4 kingsbloom) to get friendly with them?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ATTENTION! HERE IS THE SCOOP!<br /><br />Dark Iron residue is used to increase your reputation from friendly to honored with the thorium brotherhood in a repeatable quest, see below. U do this at the same place you do the repeatable quest to become friendly with the thorium brotherhood. This is done at Master Smith Burninate at Thorium Point.<br /><br />Note: To become friendly u must complete a repeatalbe quest turning in 4 kingsblood 2 incendosaur scales and a coal. This takes a total of 500 kingsblood, 250 scales and 125 coal. YES U HEARD ME RIGHT!<br /><br />Once u are friendly with the throrium brotherhood. Master Smith Burninate will have a new repeatable quest where u turn in 4 Dark Iron residue to increase your reputation. This will take a total of 960 Dark Iron Residue to become honored.<br /><br />All this for some patterns.. its crazy i know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Also you can get rep. and patterns in Tanaris at gadget.&nbsp; Just collect&nbsp; loads&nbsp; of Thorium (200+) to get rep.&nbsp; Saves time running around grabbing kingsblood etc..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is also a Thorium Brotherhood guy up in Everlook in Winterspring but I don't think my faction with them in right for him to speak with me. Everytime I have tryed he just gives me some rude answer about not having time for me. He may also provide some quest later on for gaining faction.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>a blacksmith should get to honoured my TB before doing the quests for the imperial set in gadgetzan. when you turn in thorium it will give TB rep and it is hardest to get through honoured because you have to exchange really expensive items from MC for 200 rep each at the TB in the BRD tavern</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had a bunch of Dark Iron Residue, so I looked at the AH price, hoping it would be something decent. Lowest current price, 100 for 85 silver, less than the vendor value. What a waste. How stupid are people?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>on our server the stuff sells for about 10 gold per 100 residue, but i personaly think that to be very expensve<br /><br />greets</div>

Otherwise, why should people waste their time turning this stuff in?<br /><br />It's not hard to figure out what to do with it or who to turn it into.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is used doing the same quest &quot;What the flux quest&quot;. The original quest asks for 4 kingsblood 2 scales and a coal. this quest stops when u reach friendly. He then will give you the same quest but instead of kingsblood you need the dark iron residue. That quest will take you all the way to honored at which piont the quest will stop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, we turn the residue to the guy in Thorium Point and reach Honored status with Thorium Brotherhood... then what? What good is this reputation?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think that it is turned in to the guy from the thorium brotherhood in the bar in BRD. Once you get honor with them you can buy stuff, I assume blacksmithing patterns. Seems the cheapest way, too- the other stuff they want is like Dark Iron ore, and stuff.. <br /><br />WOW I was so wrong.. that's what I get for running BRD drunk :) SOrry!<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jun 9 15:10:11 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does he really want 4 residue instead of 4 kingsblood (4 dark iron residue + 2 incendo-scales + 1 coal when you're friendly) or only 4 dark iron residue and nothing else for one reputation increase?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For enchanter example +int or +agi on weapon and +spi, for dragonscale leatherworker get patterns for nice epic boots and so on... The guy you can buy this from is inside BRD.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
