<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Post-Broodlord repeatable quest item.&nbsp; 42000 or so are needed to get a player from hated to neutral.&nbsp; <br /><br />Presumedly needed to open AQ along with the war effort quests.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's also not just 1 Fragment per kill. At least in have Regal each of those Silithids drop like 3-4 each so that cuts down on the amout of time by a lot as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its not 100% drop... it kind sux but the reward at neutral is great</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a Mage, I do roughly 150 an hour. This is with drinking, and not going chinatown style (kill kill kill!). This means that you'll be looking at 42000/150 = 280 hours if you're doing this alone.<br /><br />While you may get help from your friends, that's only because you need to get the gates of AQ open. Once they're open, I doubt many people will volunteer to help you collect 42000 items, but the questline is very fun and the rewards are great. Sucks that they couldn't make it a bit more solo friendly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Someone made me a deputy, but do i have to turn in broodlords head before i can turn them in for rep?<br />And as for drop rate they drop 1-3 and the regal ones drop 1-4, they dont always drop at least 3.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So if the gates are open and I was never a deputy are these totally useless to me?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You get reputation from other things than only these fragments. AQ40 for example gives like 100 rep to Brood of Nozdurmu. That the scales get reputation was only to motivate farming for the opening Ahn Qiraj</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So farming these is useless unless I complete the broodlord head quest?<br /><br />I've been deputized by someone random that just did it for no reason whatsoever.... but what good is deputized if you can't turn these in for rep?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Being deputized means.. that you're farming them for that person, or I suppose you could hang onto them until you do in fact get the broodlord's head since you must at least turn in 200 to further the quest line.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So.. for my question.. anyone happen to know when you stop turning these things in?.. because I can't anymore.&nbsp; Is it once you hit friendly or honored with Nozdormu or something?&nbsp; Or once you further the quest-line?&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i think i been duped&nbsp; i had it explained to me what i had to do basically&nbsp; told id be deputized for 150g&nbsp; and that the rewards would be great&nbsp; &nbsp; so i gave them the benefit of the doubt&nbsp; paid&nbsp; got deputized and now im farming these carapieces&nbsp; &nbsp; so my question is:<br />have i been duped?&nbsp; from reading the comments above&nbsp; im supposed to hand in the head myself before handing in these carapieces will get me any rewards? or can i still hand these in for rep and claim my rewards?&nbsp; is so&nbsp; where do i go to hand them in and who do i talk to?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sorry to say it but you're out 150g unless he buys the Carapaces from you which I doubt he will...Sucks that people still look for ways to cheat others out of money which isn't that easy to come by unless you get nice drops or farm a lot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Not really i say.&nbsp; I won't have Broodlords head for another two months and by then i will easily have 10,000+ carapaces farmed.&nbsp; I will probably be trading them for bijous and coins from zg just to blitz the ZG rep and for pages for CC rep from my guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When do you stop getting rep from turning these in?<br /><br />I'm trying to figure out if I should hold onto these until I'm Friendly (and no longer get rep from AQ trash), or if I need to turn them in now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if your gate is open you get rep for doing AQ 40. And it takes about 1/20th the time to get the rep then collecting silithid stuff.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>42000 !<br />omg ...<br /><br />Is it possible to have a RL life after this ?<br /><br />Best way to gain rep is probably to be patient until you are able to Kill boss in AQ with your guild. 42000 sounds crazy !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so that means instead of 42 000 you would need to turn in 17 600 of these things. MUCH easier then turning in 42 000. I may actually do this now, when I hit sixty. I want that ring at exalted that will be really nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For the one above me:<br /><br />Don't get greedy.. you only can get neutral with these things.. You can only get exalted by killing bosses in AQ40 (wich drops a item what will give you 500 rep and 100CC rep)<br /><br />Im buying stacks of them for around 7G each.. that's pretty nice cause not many people need them these day's.<br /><br />Still i have chance to get the ring thanks to my imba guild wich is raiding once a week.<br /><br />Fendorea - Shadow Conclave Hunter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Changed the rep per turnin with the 2.0 patch. Now currently 500 rep per turn in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>how much rep is 1 turn in?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>iirc it's 200 rep per turn in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>200 rep for each turn!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Agamemnicon</b></h3>Was it this bad in Vanilla? Were multiple players camping every single spawn location of every single elite bug in Silithus? Were people fighting and struggling constantly against other players to hopefully tag a respawn that took at least 5-7 minutes, so that they - on the high end - could farm just 30 fragments per hour?<br /><br />I understand that owning the mount is an exclusive privilege, and that it should require a lot of work, but this is absolute torture. They badly need to increase respawn rate on these bugs. It's mathematically impossible for even a dedicated team of 15-20 people to farm the thousands of fragments needed in the time we have remaining.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Numidia</b></h3>The most valuable resource in Azeroth at this very moment</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zerolove</b></h3>If anyone in your group has yet to complete <a href="/classic/quest=1126/hive-in-the-tower">Hive in the Tower</a>, the bugs spawned at the top of the tower have a small percent chance to drop <a href="/classic/item=20384/silithid-carapace-fragment">Silithid Carapace Fragment</a> (our data shows ~ 1-2% drop chance).<br /><br />Every little bit counts in this race, good luck out there prospective Scarab Lords!</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
