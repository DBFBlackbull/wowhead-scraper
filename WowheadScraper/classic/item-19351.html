It's a no brainer that everyone knows you get rage from dmg dealt to you more than the dmg you deal. \n\nWeapon Speed is important to tanks because Heroic Strike lands on the next auto swing of the weapon.

In a lot cases you seem to have infinite rage in the end game encounters, this means that you can spam Heroic Strike non-stop while burning your other abilities as well. This is so because Heroic Strike does not have any cooldown whatsoever, it does not even have a global cooldown - it will always activate on the next swing ","creationdate":"2006-04-26T15:12:12-05:00","id":1283015,"rating":0,"commentid":3074779,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"glutonni","importedSubject":"RE: Roll a tank before lecturing about tanking weapons"},{"body":"I am fury and I am 100% sure that with my AP I do a lot of more white damage then any rogues in raid","creationdate":"2006-04-27T00:25:31-05:00","id":1283013,"rating":0,"commentid":3074779,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"selli","importedSubject":"RE: Roll a tank before lecturing about tanking wea"},{"body":"","creationdate":"2006-04-27T00:25:55-05:00","id":1283016,"rating":0,"commentid":3074779,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"selli","importedSubject":"RE: Roll a tank before lecturing about tanking wea"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Zakoder","importedSubject":"Roll a tank before lecturing about tanking weapons"},{"commentv2":1,"number":18,"id":3074780,"nreplies":4,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I'm sorry to disappoint (and get flamed by) all you rogues, but if I were tanking in BWL and this dropped, I'd roll.

First of all Quel'Serrar is a cheap toy compared to this weapon. Also many people say DPS doesn't matter for a prot spec tank. Well, after much research and debate it turns out that white damage is most of a warriors agro generation. Point in fact a properly talent specced prot tank has a 1.45 multiplier to his threat. The more dps at a decent speed which 2.2 is very decent for tanking the more agro you will build overall. \n\nQuite simply the more geared out you are the closer you are to stuff like +defense caps, and having items that offer 1% parry and +swords (which helps ToHit significantly when tanking) helps boost your stats even higher. \n\nOne thing I'd like to point out people say Spineshatter is a better tank weapon yet turn around and say 2.2 is slow... Spineshatter is 2.6...

Melee is your highest dmg so dps\/glancing%\/hit % needed\/ are all important. if this is in your offhand while dualwield tanking the speed does not matter and parry is more effective without a shield than with. having another sword thats good\/synchronizes should be considered. in my humble opinion, warblade\/thunderfurry\/blackguard\/etc in mh with this in oh would make for a good set. a lot of bosses though in bwl for example will probably require a shield which is what most high geared tanks are concerning themselves with. some main tanks might not want as much as an off tank for this reason.  your raids strength should be factored into this as some tanks can dw on bwl bosses(broodlord dw cringe though gl). oh and what traits youre stacking matter as well 10%parry  or 5%dodge 5%parry the 10 is better(not just because parrying an attack decreases your current swing time) because you are more likely to avoid the attack than with two 5%. you dont add them together to make 10%dodge\/parry. cant just kill a mob with a 1%drop chance and expect it to drop after 100 kills for ex.

He had told me that with using the Maladath as a fury warrior that he was able to grind mobs for quests pretty effectively, and it also helped out a great deal for tanking.<br /><br />So, my belief on it is if you could pick this up and OH it with say a Ancient Qiraji Ripper or an Iblis, Blade of the fallen Seraph, you would be in pretty good hands as a warrior or a rogue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>quel is better for tanking</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Most who have a clue recognize that this weapon is better than Quel'Serrar for tanking, although tanks may not want to take it in order to save their wad of dkp for something better.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just enjoy sitting back dual weilding this and the Quel because im bored crapless with my 3.4 speed Bonereaver's Edge and need something refreshing once in a while. Didnt cost me a lot of Dkp and it dropped last night on my guilds first BL kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In all honesty this is more of a rogue/fury warr wep because of the +sword skill. Yes is does have the parry but just get your guild to make you a black guard which is better. Also the +sword skill for threat is bogus just because all the tanks in my guild say they have no problem keep aggro with their quel,blackguard, or spineshatterer. (which is why thunderfury should go to a rogue or dps fury warr).<br />So really from what our tanks tell me is that they would rather have stam etc than this weap. Still Don't get me wrong it is nice for tanking but there are better that are easier to get. And to the post above dude I have 4.5k on my ROGUE so really get some gear. Also wouldn't it be nice to have more health when you DONT parry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No one denies that Quel'Serar is an excellant tanking weapon, but its cost and availability put it out of reach for some. I don't have one because I have never seen one on AH for a price I am willing to pay, at the moment I am tanking with BL's Defender because I am too nice to take a Maladath off a DPS class who wants it and as of yet only one Spineshatter has dropped. <br /><br />And to the guy who said TF isn't good for tanking L2P, the proc generates lots of agro and it slows their attack speed, which makes healing the tank easier. It also has very good DPS and a nice speed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a prot spec'd warrior....and ended up getting this sword. After swinging the Quel for +/-8 months...it was refreshing to get something new. I'm loving this thing. I'm an OT in our raids and often end up pulling aggro off the MT since getting this sword. All the numbers and science aside....this sword places me higher in the damage meters, gives me better aggro, and is an all around kick ass tanking sword. I like it better than the Quel and have used it exclusively since getting it. And out soloing.....DW'ing Quel and Maladath simply rocks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow.... That blade looks SICK! Even better than Thunderfury IMO</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For everyone saying this isn't for tanks, you really should first roll a main tank in a high end guild before saying what is good for tanking and what isn't.<br /> Yes, it isn't nearly as fast as Bloodlor's or Quel'Serrar, but if you have ever been a main tank you would know that the main source of rage is the dmg you take... not your own swings. If it's the defence stats on foresaid &quot;tanking swords&quot; that make them &quot;superior&quot; in someway. You are wrong again. Only the bloodlord's +stamina is any good in my book. At this point in the game I really doubt any MT has less that around 400 defence, so he really doesen't need any more of it.<br /> The parry and especially the +swords makes this an ideal sword for main tank, since it help with landing sunders and revenges.<br /> I'm not saying this isn't one of the best swords for a rogue or a fury warrior, because I know it is. But seriously this is also the second most best maintanking sword right after thunderfury (don't even start you greedy rogues... Thunderfury has been proven to be the best sword for tanking).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm sorry to disappoint (and get flamed by) all you rogues, but if I were tanking in BWL and this dropped, I'd roll. As a tank the +Swords would help immensely with holding aggro because it essentially reduces the chance said mob would have to dodge sunders. And with +Parry, well simply that's a few less hits that would land on me during a fight, which meansI have a greater chance of survival (a BIG plus in my book). And if one of my guild's rogues got angry because I looted it I'd make a concerted effort to keep running MC so they can get another Brutality Blade/Corehound Tooth or in the least smith them a Heartseeker. :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, I'd definately reroll swords for this baby, especially for the looks ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Would you HONESTLY use this with Thunderfury? I mean, Blackguard is faster, which means more procs with poison and Sword Spec.(if you got it) I'm just not quite so sure about this one... It might look cool beside Thunderfury IMO...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For a fury warrior or rogue, that uses swords, I'd say this one is way better then Iblis. I'm a fury warrior myself, and uses this one with CTS. And I'm a human aswell, so those +9 swordskills make all that glancing just dissapear :]<br />Also using this beauty for tanking, and it's doing a very good job.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>k one thing its not a good tanking wep, seriously no, Bloodlords defenders 10 times better than this, why oh yea the + def and stam and faster speed to ^^ whats next give it to a rogue:P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this as mainhand and the nightmare blade as the off hand that would look really cool</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is easily best served in the hands of a rogue/fury warrior. BL Defender is better and the lack of DPS isnt a big deal when your tanking, your there to establish aggro, not DPS the boss down. L2P Nubs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Clearly a warrior weapon, 1: Theres only really 2 tanking weapons between zg and bwl. 2: rogues can get around 10 difference weapons between zg - bwl so let's keep it fair, 3: same with fury warriors, they can also get all kinds of weapons so stop qq and give it to a tank!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Since Speed doesnt matter anymore, this blade is great for Rogues, well, probaly only usefull if you got Riposte, otherwise the stats are pretty useless</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No, a warrior can have a much better tanking weapon. Tank weapons are generally mian-handers only, if you haven't noticed.<br /><br />No, a fury warrior would hate this, as it's too slow, and a tanking warrior can get better than this. A rogue sword all the way, through and through. They'll get much more out of what it gives than any warrior out there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Picked this up last night, me and another Rogue had the same dkp (All warriors passed) so rolled for it and luckily won.<br /><br />Let me just say, I used to use Chromatically Tempered Sword main / Brutality Blade offhand (Dual wielding crusader) and have reasonable DPS but a 2.50 speed offhand with the missrate is still questionable on a PvE specced Rogue (even with lots of %hit) Anyway, Picked it up and got 15agility on it and my DPS has gone up considerably, although I miss 9str, 9agi 1% crit, I gain a hell of alot of white damage from offhand, faster hits and more damage and with 15agil I kind of only lose 3atk power and a small amount of crit but I can make that up by upgrading some of my items.. And to all those who say Sword mainhand, dagger offhand sure, the speed is nice but if you have 5/5 Sword spec 2 swords makes for alot more sword spec procs, and alot more DPS! Of course it all comes down to your playstyle..<br /><br />Quite funny to see some of my gear paired along with one of the best sword spec combo's in the game - but im not complaining =) <br /><br />Also yes, it does make a good tanking weapon granted, sword skill helps land sunders (Vaelastrasz misses + heal aggro comes to mind here :P) and parry well, speaks for itself less hits landed on a tank isnt a bad thing also the speed is good for generating rage and whatnot. But really, your Warriors can find just as good weapons elsewhere like ours and im VERY glad they passed, and I won the roll with a 23. :D <br /><br />Swordspec wins!<br /><br />Edited, Fri Mar 31 15:45:58 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Being a riposte sword rogue, this would be perfect in offhand..... perfect.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For anyone uninformed combat rogues are the best DPS beside or above dagger rogues. this without question is the best sword available to sword combat rogues for thier offhand. +parry is a much needed stat for us as is +swords. There are no real items armor wise catered to sword combat rogues. theres alot of +dagger stuff, and absolutely no +sword stuff for rogues. the speed is perfect for our offhand as is the max damage. Two things people must know. 2.00+ is not a good tanking weapon, the added damage is ok for aggro, but not the main underlying factor in tanking, the added sword is miniscule for tanking but a slight increase is ok. I can verywell see tanks desireing this sword, but unless there aren't sword rogues there they should wait thier turn. Alot of sword rogues are stuck with lackluster offhands due to the poor selection and poor droprates. Endgame combos for most sword rogues up until this point is vishkag with brutality blade. new options are nightmare blade from a outdoor raid dragon, which can be very difficult to take down with faction troubles. the current best endgame setup for sword rogues is either HWL weapons or chromatically tempered/maladath. As far as pve effectiveness, tanks do pristinely fine without this and with quel serrar/otherwise. A tanks goal is to be effective at maintaining aggro and this sword, only due in part to it's speed is not the preffered weapon over quel serrar. <br />And fury warriors, please send me the best equipped fury warrior you got and I will outdps the ever living crap out of them without trying. I've done it with our vishkag/brutality blade warrior enough.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got this baby tonight and i love it, im using it as a main hand right now with CHT off hand just until i get a chromatically tempered sword then the dagger goes bye bye but i just want to say taht even with the fast attack speed the 2.2 is really awesome imo i still get 800+ sinisters and 1.3k + non crit eviscerates whihc is like 2.2k + eviscerate crits i think thats really awesome with this sword and as a human having 309/309 swords is crazy for landing stuff and a boost in crit chance. all i have to say. hehe its also a server first so i got a buncha newbs saying oooo where u get it lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this is not a rogue sword. 60 rogue speaking from experience here, and i would easily rather be wielding a fast off hand, or a reeeealy slow one.<br />thats what rogues are, burst damage, off hand should be either slower than 2.6 or so. or it should be faster or at about 1.7. this is a tank sword. but in the end dkp prevails and some dumbass rogue with more dkp who wins can have it, but hey, not my problem. consider chromatically tempered sword in main hand and either the offhand from the hakkari set or vis'kag in off hand<br />-hogwash 60 rogue, bloodscalp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yeah it is</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After reading all these posts it's amazing how many uninformed players there are about Tanking Weapons. First of all Quel'Serrar is a cheap toy compared to this weapon. Also many people say DPS doesn't matter for a prot spec tank. Well, after much research and debate it turns out that white damage is most of a warriors agro generation. Point in fact a properly talent specced prot tank has a 1.45 multiplier to his threat. The more dps at a decent speed which 2.2 is very decent for tanking the more agro you will build overall. <br /><br />Quite simply the more geared out you are the closer you are to stuff like +defense caps, and having items that offer 1% parry and +swords (which helps ToHit significantly when tanking) helps boost your stats even higher. <br /><br />One thing I'd like to point out people say Spineshatter is a better tank weapon yet turn around and say 2.2 is slow... Spineshatter is 2.6... Anyway this weapon is a great tanking sword, and anyone who really thinks otherwise doesn't know all the facts about tanking and how agro works.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This will be a nice offhand when I get Thunderfury.<br /><br />Thunderfury + Fury Spec + Maelstrom Card = Mega Proc uberage... <br /><br />And having this bad boy offhand is just pure intimidation</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>so i can use this for my rogue right? (after leveling about 38 more lvls) <br />is it pretty fast for rogues to kill ppl?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First, this sword looks freakin amazing (along with nightmare blade).<br /><br />As far as who should get it, its clear that it is a rogue/DPS warrior sword. This isnt a tanking sword at all, sword skill doesnt help you hold agro, 1 parry isnt much. I'd rather use a quicker 1H with more tanking stats for tanking (bloodlord's defender, TF, even quel'serrar, or a widow's remorse) more then this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Imagine what it would look like to dual weild 2 of these.. that would be SICK.<br /><br />great looking blade!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you are in a raid and this drops, of course you will let your tank get it over any other class. For the players not familiar with BWL and are just looking at the drops in there, when your main tank loses agro, or dies. The attempt is over, the raid dies within seconds, and you must try again. So before complaining, it is far more important for your tanking warriors to get an upgrade than whatever minor dps upgrade you will get. Think about it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>id rather have brutality blade + cromaticly tempered combo</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think this thing is ideal for rogues. Fury warriors, maybe.. but the parry and +swords seems perfect for riposting and the combat talents. Its fast, but not fast enough for tanking, and not fast enough to make a really good fury wep. All the warriors who want this, I dont see why.. you can get Quel or Bloodlords defender LOADS easier than this. To take it from a poor rogue such as myself... unthinkable! : p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I also agree this is a DECENT tanking sword. Not the best but will do the job. But this is a rogues priority in the off hand for sure. If the rogues pass it then the tanks and the fury warriors can fight over it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Not with same sword cuz it's a unique weapon. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a rogue, I have BB and Maladath. Maladath is way better for PvE plain and simple as i have done many tests in BWL/MC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Rogues offhand :) would be pretty amazing ^_^<br />together with Chromatically Tempered Sword in main, and i will be unstoppable ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is it possible to Duel Wield this amazing sword?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hogwash speaks truth, there is a 60 rogue on my server with this sword and all I can say is, LOOT &amp;*!@#.<br /><br />This sword will benefit your guild much more in the hands of a warrior, also speaking from experience of both classes at 60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LOL. Im reading all these posts about how &quot;it's a rogue weapon&quot;, and &quot;no way, warrior weapon&quot;. but I'm a pally and if this dropped I would roll on it in a blink of an eye. I just play this game to have fun, and fun in this game is kickin tail and lookin awesome. Thats what this weapon is. Pallies don't rule but i play one anyway and there awesome.... :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Isnt it great for Rouge offhand with dagger?<br /><br />I think you can deal a lot of dmg with that weapon{Backstab}(good spead and nice stats with good average dmg).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ide love to tank with this... right now i use deathbringer, and i hold aggro better than warriors in full might, i tank through dmg and im our guilds main tank :) this sword would be titties for me, i like the +to swords and the parry and the dps on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>wouldn't mind 1 or 2 of them for a fury warrior.. heroic strike and that would be quite nice</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is the best tanking sword in the game, far superior to Bloodlord's Defender, Quel'Serrar and anything else you can think of. You want to know why? I'll tell you why.<br /><br />1) High DPS. It has some of the highest DPS in the game. Believe it or not DPS is a major portion of a tank's aggro. A tank with defiance needs to merely do ~256 damage to do equal threat of a sunder armor<br /><br />2) Parry. Duh.<br /><br />3) +4 to Swords. Most highly underestimated part of this sword. <br /><br />This is the best stat for a tank to have in the game. The only time tanking really matters is versus bosses, who are level 63 mobs. <br /><br />When you are tanking a level 63 mob, you miss and they parry/dodge... A LOT. Increasing your level to practically 61 will decrease this parry/miss hcance by a TON, which is very benefitial in tanking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>as a rogue i wouldnt roll on it. Better for tanks and such id rather have alot of other things.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this baby yesterday for my rogue. main chromatically tempered sword, off maladath. well...killer. the +4 swords is definatly great. missing the target? not very often now :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The sword dont got any class requirement. And btw, none of you will roll for it; In a guild raid u spend dkp's and is your officers who decide if you can roll or not. And if yo go with a pickup raid, you will never put a step on BWL. lol. Stop posting for stupidicies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a sword rogue an i'll bet on this if it would drop. Good offhand speed, parry for riposte and +swords give a bigger chance to hit to crit etc.<br />Our tanks, exploding because of alle the epixXx from MC and Zul don't need this sword for tanking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>im a tank and find it insane to get Quel Serar for 2000g as this is the price on my server. I have farmed ZG with my guild for over 2 1/2 months now... or maybe more than that. Still havent seen Bloodlords defender drop. at least 20 full runs. Im 2nd in tanking order. My advise to tanks: <b>Get it if u dont have either Quel Serar or Bloodlords defender. and use it till u get either QS or BD.</b> Its just my opinion, and i am really not selfish even if i sound so: priority to the tanks / balance dps between classes, if u want to progress in pve.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MrGaffer</b></h3>This weapon is an excellent off-hand for sword rogues and fury warriors. Compared to various alternatives, there are many better weapons out there for tank mainhand weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MrGaffer</b></h3>According to the AtlasLoot addon this item's droprate is 10.7%<br /><br />This sword is a fantastic offhand weapon for rogues and fury warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Erzschurke</b></h3>If you are a Human Sword Rogue. This Sword is crap for you, because you dont profit from the stats. Hard Cap for Weapon expertise is 308. With this you have 314. Take <a href="/classic/item=19866/warblade-of-the-hakkari">Warblade of the Hakkari</a> instead. It is much better for you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thope</b></h3>So, deciding if i should get this and thought i would look up some info. while going through these comments i noticed that rarely is anyone who is commenting on its tanking capabilities is mentioning whether you are fury/prot, dual wielding, main tank, off tank, main hand, off hand, etc.. itemization can determine whether an item is bis or not for a particular character(assuming there are other close items to choose from). that being said i believe after 308 weapon skill benefits start to drop off significantly. Melee is your highest dmg so dps/glancing%/hit % needed/ are all important. if this is in your offhand while dualwield tanking the speed does not matter and parry is more effective without a shield than with. having another sword thats good/synchronizes should be considered. in my humble opinion, warblade/thunderfurry/blackguard/etc in mh with this in oh would make for a good set. a lot of bosses though in bwl for example will probably require a shield which is what most high geared tanks are concerning themselves with. some main tanks might not want as much as an off tank for this reason. your raids strength should be factored into this as some tanks can dw on bwl bosses(broodlord dw cringe though gl). oh and what traits youre stacking matter as well 10%parry or 5%dodge 5%parry the 10 is better(not just because parrying an attack decreases your current swing time) because you are more likely to avoid the attack than with two 5%. you dont add them together to make 10%dodge/parry. cant just kill a mob with a 1%drop chance and expect it to drop after 100 kills for ex. (blackguard/mala/t2gloves/t1legs/counterstone/talents alone can amount to 10% on top of your default+defense bonus. this would also increase your dmg(faster swings) 304weapon skill decreases the amount of hit needed on a boss by 1% 305 by 3% so the one more from whatever source would increase the benefit substantially.</div>
