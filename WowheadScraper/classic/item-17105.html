Excellent mace, looks very cool with a golden halo around it.  As to the debate, this is, undoubtedly a Paladin\/Shaman weapon with the possibility of a druid\/priest roll depending on how the raid wanted to go.  \n\nOur raid last night debated long and hard on whether the priests should get a chance at it or not.  I'm glad that they were eventually not allowed, although i can definitely see the argument and wouldn't be angry if they had rolled: I was just anxious waiting to see if anyone could beat my 95! \n\nAs to warriors\/rogues - I think it's absolutely ridiculous to demand that they should be allowed to roll on an item that gives bonuses to intelligence and mana regeneration.  There are nicer 1H weapons in the game that give massive bonuses to critical hit chances, Agility and Strength, etc. that I have been refused to roll on in lieu of a Warrior or Rogue in the group.  For the most part, I wholeheartedly agree - if there's a chance to roll on a crit chance weapon; give it to the rogue or warrior who need the increased damage.\n\nIf you look at the profiles of those who use it, there isn't a single Warrior or Rogue who equips the mace: what I'm saying is that in every single raid that has had this mace drop, the members have agreed that this weapon belongs in the hands of a Paly\/Shaman\/Priest\/Druid.\n  \nPaladins are, nearly exclusively, 'Healadins' in MC, and if you're playing a melee paly in MC, then your raid doesn't have enough warriors - plain and simple.

In fact, I have never heard of a single successful MC raid allowing something like that and have to conclude that each of these greedy idiotic rogues thinking up reason why they should be allowed to roll on it....will in fact never have a chance to do so, because they won't be brought along.  The ONLY way I could see a rogue getting this weapon is if every single caster class in the raid either already had it or wanted to pass.  While I understand the base damage is nice for rogues, its the limited number and weapons that really suit Shamans\/Pally's in MC....hell Shamans can't use 2h swords so its even worse for us.  We get sorcerous dagger, aurastone, and finkle's.....and thats about it.","date":"2005-06-12T10:11:35-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Jedimo","importedSubject":"What we do . . ."},{"commentv2":1,"number":41,"id":3060775,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Restore Druid here...

Not nearly as much competition for Kazzak too since everyone's all about Azuregos.","creationdate":"2005-04-25T21:06:56-05:00","id":1277798,"rating":0,"commentid":3060796,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Kunlun","importedSubject":"RE: Best epic hammer for mace specced rogue"},{"body":"Humid, you're a moron.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Incendium</b></h3>To comment, I think that it's much more useful to Paladins than it is druids/priests/shaman. The paladin is the only healer class that cannot use staves, and most of the really good healer items are staves. That's not to say that there aren't alternatives that are good or better, i'm just saying that i'd much rather have a paladin with this than a priest or druid.<br /><br />A paladin wielding this with Malistar's Defender (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17106">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17106</a>) will be set for starting Blackwing Lair.<br /><br />Take a look at will of arlokk, or benediction for priests. A spirit enchant on either will go a long way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wedmark</b></h3>I've got this with 22 Intellect on for my Paladin. Combined with Malistar's Defender (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17106">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17106</a>). Don't know yet, but I think I will upgrade to Red Dragonscale Protector (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19348">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19348</a>)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>salvation122</b></h3>Honestly, as a paladin, I'd look to Jin'Do's Hexxer or a Mageblade over an Aurastone. With Illumination, extra spell crit makes the mana regen a wash, and both have more Heal than an Aurastone.<br /><br />The Aurastone has marginally more DPS, but let's be honest, you're not going to be smacking stuff with this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>97</b></h3>As a shaman I put +22 intellect on mine... Having almost 8000 raid buffed mana is sweet =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eline</b></h3>Was using the Zulian scepter from ZG (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22713">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22713</a>), and just upgraded to this. I love now that I can get the same healing bonus with a bit more stats boost and have it viable for PvP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6828</b></h3>A Mageblade is better than this for healing in my opinion. In fact a Bloodcaller (from ZG) is better.<br /><br />A very cool looking hammer though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6812</b></h3>I've used this on my druid forever, and actually still use it in naxx with my lei of the lifegiver offhand (using dkp on other items). <br /><br />These class discussions are kind of pointless, because while yes item x&gt;item b by a tiny bit, loot is done for the most part by random drops. Some guilds on my server have never seen a Death's Sting drop, while others have gotten 2 in their first 3 kills. <br /><br />This is a great mace for Druids, Paladins and Shaman. It is also a good item for priests, but I would save my dkp for a benediction.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6888</b></h3>I used Hodoo stick over this from ZG, simply because I liked the crit over this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7736</b></h3>Great for a healadin or a druid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7266</b></h3>This would be great for a paladin like myself or a shaman. I would prefer having Jin'do's Hexxer over this though <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19890">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19890</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9590</b></h3>I have this on my druid and I must say it is great. For anyone running Molten Core and Blackwing Lair it really is good probably up until the end of BWL. I say this is useful for any casters and should not be placed on the top of the priority list for any class. Also looks pretty slick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I haven't seen many pictures of this hammer and what I did see seemed to be outdated.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Quick question: Did any warrior/rogue actually post that they wanted this weapon? I may have missed it, but please, these forums are for info on the game, not for calling each other idiots.<br /><br />The hammer is best suited for a hybrid class for reasons already stated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok i'm a pala, if i saw i saw a rogue/warrior with this i'd laugh. Rogues&nbsp; if you want a nice 1h weapon go for something like <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37696">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37696</a> , much more suited to a rogue.<br />And Warriors go for something like <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37423">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37423</a> .Brutality Blade even drops off the same boss :P<br />actually SS rogues would like Brutality Blade too... just please dont roll on Aurastone. <br />They both drop in Mc, and they would be much better use of DKP<br /><br />Definately suited to Pala/shammy or druid, not so much druid as they have cat/bear forms for the damage but i would argue if one rolled against me :)<br />Priest weapon maybe if palas/ shammies and ruids pasted on it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Clearly a weapon for mainly a Pally or Shaman. I think its even appropriate for a Priest or Druid to roll on. Any Rogue that would roll on this over one of the classes stated above is an @55h01e. I didnt know that intellect and mana regen was so important to Rogues. Why would a Rogue be in Molten Core anyways? Totally useless in that instance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Druid too</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I picked this up in Molten Core last night off Garr. Excellent mace, looks very cool with a golden halo around it. As to the debate, this is, undoubtedly a Paladin/Shaman weapon with the possibility of a druid/priest roll depending on how the raid wanted to go. <br /><br />Our raid last night debated long and hard on whether the priests should get a chance at it or not. I'm glad that they were eventually not allowed, although i can definitely see the argument and wouldn't be angry if they had rolled: I was just anxious waiting to see if anyone could beat my 95! <br /><br />As to warriors/rogues - I think it's absolutely ridiculous to demand that they should be allowed to roll on an item that gives bonuses to intelligence and mana regeneration. There are nicer 1H weapons in the game that give massive bonuses to critical hit chances, Agility and Strength, etc. that I have been refused to roll on in lieu of a Warrior or Rogue in the group. For the most part, I wholeheartedly agree - if there's a chance to roll on a crit chance weapon; give it to the rogue or warrior who need the increased damage.<br /><br />If you look at the profiles of those who use it, there isn't a single Warrior or Rogue who equips the mace: what I'm saying is that in every single raid that has had this mace drop, the members have agreed that this weapon belongs in the hands of a Paly/Shaman/Priest/Druid.<br /><br />Paladins are, nearly exclusively, 'Healadins' in MC, and if you're playing a melee paly in MC, then your raid doesn't have enough warriors - plain and simple. Our job is to continually flash heal and debuff - that's it. We DI when a SS isn't up, and we take aggro from the chance mob that's attacking our cloth-wearers (although we'll die in the encounter most assuredly), and we almost ALWAYS use 1H weapon and shield. <br /><br />VonPenn <br />lvl 60 Paly <br />Draenor <br />Forgotten Souls</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got it today as a priest. No pallies would want it, so I don't feel bad about getting it =))<br />Need an epic off-hand instead of my Penelope's Rose now =) <br />Can't decide which one is better though - the one from Ony or Fire Ruined Grimoire. Was thinking that spirit takes over for me, but +11dmg/healing is pretty damn good too. Bah, why worry, I'll just get both :D<br /><br />Oh, and all you warriors and rogues that are gonna roll on this against casters - good luck finding a new guild ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Won this weapon on Friday and deeply considered the enchants I could put on it. Ruling out +22 Int, +55 Healing, and +30 Spell Damage because they all roxor, the best enchant would be Crusader. Especially for a shaman with EarthFury gear. The +healing gear you rake up will add onto the healing crusader gives and instead of the 75-125 other classes get, you would recieve usually upwards of 250 depending on how much +healing gear you have on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a Paladin / Shaman weapon. No question about it, priests and druids may roll for it only after paladins pass on it. We got 3 already in our guild and all went to paladins. Best enchant for it is the +22 Intellect, no doubt about it. It is the best Healadin weapon and just a second choice for other classes. <br /><br />Even the name says so: Aura (something Paladins use all the time)<br /><br />Edited, Thu Oct 13 16:24:10 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i would roll on that in an instance. hahaha, ok mb that wasn't funny, but as a rogue, i'd roll on it just b/c rogues are selfish and self centered. just how we are ;), but honestly? i am a rouge and would definately roll on this.. though.. rolling prolly wouldn't occur, because this would be god, 2nd tothe teebu's longsword for a combat spec rogue, and i believe any melee class should get it over a caster/wtv class because our damage is dependent on our weapon, thought it's not a huge dependency, the base weapon damage on this thing is still amazing, and as such melee classes should get dibso n this first. im sure u can get similar amounts of int from other weapon combos, we can't.. this kind of damage is obsene..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No one but a Shaman would even be considered for rolling on this. It was clearly designed for Paladins / Shamans. Only a very stupid rogue / druid / priest would want this anyways, and if you are that dumb I can guarantee you won't be killing Garr in MC for a longggggg time. Rogues would never waste DKP on that since there are much better items, a druid / priest can't use shields so anything but a 2h is completely stupid. Shamans have to use 1h / shield and rest spec, priests holy / disc, etc. to be in our runs. Once you guys actually realize how hard MC is and make it there, you will understand why no rogue / druid / priest would want or ever would be allowed to roll on this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Someone doesn't know how to read, DKP is dead, and was a bad idea from the start.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got mine last night.. Lark 60 Paladin of Sunder on Proudmoore. This hammer looks so hard, it naturally glows a golden yellow, is pretty beefy in size, and has intricate designs on its sides. Matches Lightforge Armor/BP really nicely. The mana regen is nice, but really not that intense. I would like to see it as a 'use to increase mana' feature but that sorta clashes with the aura effect. If it was a TRUE aurastone hammer it would give that mana regen effect to the holder's entire party, like the Paladin's devotion, fire resistance, etc auras. Just my 2cents.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Would anyone have a problem with a Pala gettin this one?<br /><br />We`re fighters, so the stamina and dps would certainly come to good use.<br /><br />We`re also casters, so the intellect and stamina sure as *ell won`t go to waste either.<br /><br />And in addition we`re healers(in less than perfect raid groups, a paladin is quite often the main-healer in his group), so the healing bonus is very nice as well.<br /><br />Personally I`ve had my eyes on this one for quite a while, it would be my endgame weapon, and I wouldn`t leave the house without it, ever.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I`m a lvl 60 Pala on Doomhammer (EU).<br />I`ve had this baby lined up as my end-game hammer for months now.<br />And now I find myself doing regular MC raids with my guild, and I`ve seen it drop.<br /><br />I would personally say that priests and druids are very much entitled to roll on it (although the dps would be wasted, they would still benefit as much as me in lategame raids, as we`re all heal-bots at that point).<br /><br />But, to any rogues out there, please, please don`t roll on this.<br />If u do, come with me to Ubrs and watch me roll on your felstriker, just watch me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this mace about a month ago and I love it to death. IMO its the best 1h weapon for a Shammy in the game, but that is debateable. Our raid has had 3 drop and Shaman have gotten all 3 with priests allowed to roll if they choose. Most priests choose to save their points for Staff of Dominance instead though and Druids/Shamans go for Finkle's Lava Dredger as well. With all the daggers and swords available to warriors and rogues in MC it is beyond my comprehension that any rogue could call themselves reasonable taking this mace from casters when their options are limited. In fact, I have never heard of a single successful MC raid allowing something like that and have to conclude that each of these greedy idiotic rogues thinking up reason why they should be allowed to roll on it....will in fact never have a chance to do so, because they won't be brought along. The ONLY way I could see a rogue getting this weapon is if every single caster class in the raid either already had it or wanted to pass. While I understand the base damage is nice for rogues, its the limited number and weapons that really suit Shamans/Pally's in MC....hell Shamans can't use 2h swords so its even worse for us. We get sorcerous dagger, aurastone, and finkle's.....and thats about it.</div>

No, we are not the uberest things ever.)<br /><br />Thankfully, we assign loot to classes and roles ahead of time, and then have revolving queues for who can accept or pass each piece of loot. Druids and priests were not an option, and I agree fully with that decision...Priests get sexy staves, druids get two-handed healing maces and staves. It all works out. Now for a Malistar's Defender...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I read all the debates about this can I came up with a conclusion... Many classes can use this so... Thats why theres a roll system, if it drops and someone rolls on it, GREAT, they'll use it just as much as you. If certain items were designed for a specific class, they wouldn't have a roll system. And hell, I could use that insane rogue dagger, I just choose to let the rogues have it. I'm also a hunter BTW so im unbiased.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dunno what people have against Druids. I have both a Paladin and Druid at lvl 60, I would use this on either one. Little more for Paladin though since many Paladins switch to 1h + Shield for heavy casting. I'm going to get flamed with this one, but with Hand of Edward the Odd I would put it on a Druid over a paladin since Druid spells have longer casting times. Most Paladin spells are quick casting except a couple Undead specific ones and Holy Light(not even that slow). Besides, in a Party/Raid group, I prefer to stick Blessing of Light on everyone and spam Flash of Light to keep everyone topped off, and only Holy Light when someone gets 70% or less.<br /><br />Also, Druids can deal damage while not as well as other Melee Classes, but they can be on par with a Paladin w/o Seal of Command or Righteousness active.</div>

Fire Ruined Grimoire would be my first choice but I'd think a lot of mages in my guild want that for their Mageblade. And it is a pretty rare drop too. Or I could go for the one with the skeleton from Onyx, seems not a bad choice for a druid since we are a low DPS class. I'm also halfway to reverred in AV, I could go for Lei of the Lifegiver as well (or the similar one with +33 dmg/heal).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Rogues may want this but it would be much better suited for healers then damage dealers. How do you get to Molten Core with out healers? If a healer is stuck in combat that mana regen would be very useful. And also as stated before if you had a healer with a offhand of mana regen if your healer got stuck in combat they would beable to do alot more in long battles. Rogues like the DPS but look at the mana regen. When does a rogue need 4 mana every 5 sec? No where but on its healer in MC or fighting Onyxia. Also when you do Molten Core or Onyxia if it was set on group loot it would be instanly stupid incase someone rolled on epic calss gear which is limited to class only! Rogues are frail in Molten Core and die fast without good healing so please remember that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'll say this, it's the best one hander for a paladin who is doing MC level encounters. The Int/Sta are great, and the extra mana regen follows suit. Swinging this with Judgement and Seal of Wisdom, along with Blessing of Wisdom, would bring in a LOT of mana. I realize that most mobs in MC get JoLight, but I can seal myself and recover mana very quickly.<br /><br />I don't debate that it's a solid weapon for a mace rogue, but if you're a mace rogue in MC, you're wasting 5 talent points at least.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">Ironic calling me ignorant when you don't even know that it is 6% chance to stun and not 5%. Rogues are 100% useless, plain and simple. Anyone taking more than one rogue (to take the rogue loot that drops, and to die of course) simply doesn't have enough of the right classes or are flat out morons. Rogues do not deserve any item, let alone stealing one that is obviously designed for and benefits another class far more. There are rogue items out there (like Bloodletter) and those are the ones they should get. It's the exact same thing like a rogue rolling on gift of the elven magi just because it has good dps...it is obviously designed for shaman.</div><br /><br />Wow, you must know NOTHING about rogues compared to other classes. I am in a guild that ussualy has about 5 to 10 rogues per MC raid. We have the mod that calculates overdamage of each player in the raid. ALWAYS....and i mean ALWAYS. Rogues are the top damage dealers in our guild. The damage our 8 or so mages and 10 or so hunters do together dont even match the damage output of all our rogues. Rogues, though we are somewhat frail, if played right, deal THE MOST DAMAGE IN THE GAME....PERIOD. With that in mind, a rogues damage is only as good as his gear. We are a gear driven class. So, if your wondering why rogues are always looking for the best weapons, its cuase we are ONLY AS GOOD AS THE WEAPONS WE WIELD when it comes to dishing out hurt. You can have all the best skills in the world, but your rogue is going to suck if your weapons suck.</div>

You can easily get 11 mana every 5 seconds with this and like 17 Intel and 25 to healing when combined was a quest reward offhand?&quot; &quot;So what, I’m a rogue, and all I care about is dps, who cares if this has amazing stats for a 1 hand, throw all those stats out the window so I can use a weapon no raid leader would ever let a rogue roll on.&quot;<br /><br />I don't know why you argue, you have a sweet sword off of golemagg, dagger from domo's chest, and another dagger from ragnaros. Stop claiming everything under the sun when you'll never roll on it unless you're in a good guild. And no guild is going to give this to the one of 1-4 rogues in a mc group when there are like 8 priests lots of paladins, and druids who can use all the stats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got it in MC yesterday and extremely happy with it. This is definitely a shaman/paladin weapon because both use all of the item bonusses on it, we are hybrid for a reason ffs. Druids should go for a staff of dominance instead of this with offhand but w/e thats your decision. Priests should just get their benediction unless you are as stubbern as mr. BadAxe. It's quite ironic how you state you wanna look 'mean' to the opposing faction by wearing a mace, but you roll a priest in the first place? I mean... lol.<br /><br />Anyways, gonna get +22 int on this baby for sure... <br /><br />And can anyone post a link to the new 1.9 graphics please? Above one is broken...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd say... Moonkin, Paladin/Shaman, Shadow Priest.<br /><br />Any caster that likes to do damage and isn't a mage or warlock... this is all for you. I think that because... mages and warlocks have access to all the other good damage stuff. So I think any alternative caster gets a shot.<br /><br />that being said, my guild got this while i was in class, but I didn't have the dkp or anything, so... yeah.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><a href="http://www.wowcensus.com/overall_stats.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowcensus.com/overall_stats.php</a><br /><br />this is a great example. 1/3rd of the population of warcraft is not a paladin. Yes Horde are outnumbered but that's a different issue altogether. if you do the math, there's about the same percentage of Paladins per alliance as there are Shamans per horde. And me... I'm a rogue so I can have a bit of an objective point of view I hope. Of course if you think wowcensus is rigged my arguement holds nothing, just putting in my shady word. This mace is sweet looking none the less. Paladin OR Shaman.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ya the mods are useless for a rogue but damn is the dmg on that thing sweet. That would do a ton of dmg with my SS. So ya if it dropped I would roll on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow, any rogue saying they would roll on this, how retarded are you?<br /><br />Its like a shaman rolling on the deathstriker for a DPS upgrade, get real.<br /><br />On my server, if a rogue even dared to roll on this, it would be the last MC run he/she would be involved in, never mind getting his arse booted from the current guild.<br /><br />Horde wise, this is a shaman weapon. The only other class that would even have any argument to roll on that, would be a priest.</div>
