The only problems is it relies on a) Stealth and b) High Fire Resistance to solo.&nbsp; It could however be done by 2 well equipped people almost as fast I rekon, stealth or not.\n\n1) Enter Blackrock Depths, take the left hand door (requires BRD key) and assassinate the fire elemental there.&nbsp; Take the first right and then open the garrison door, slaying the fire elemental patrol there.&nbsp; Do not open the shadowforge lock!\n\n2) Head up the stairs, killing the fire elemental patrol if its around and head up into the arena, stealth round to the far side and into the coridor with the statue used in the key quest.\n\n3) Head out towards the bridge to the barracks but be very careful, theres a pack right at the end that sometime has a dog in it.&nbsp; There are 4 potential positions that the dog can stand, 2 of them are safe if you hug the opposite wall, the third theres no way to pass, the final I have not seen yet.&nbsp; If its in the impossible position a rogue can risk a vanish, but it may be safer just to ignore the next step and head back.\n\n4) Head onto the bridge and kill the patrol when its about halfway across (do not go too far to the other side or you will start the event where a patrol approaches the bridge from either side.&nbsp; Once he's down kill the 2 near the door you entered from, before stealthing to the far side.&nbsp; The patrol event mentioned above will start, and the mobs will meet in the center of the bridge and stay there.&nbsp; Wait for them to pass, kill the 2 elementals on the far side then backtrack totally and return to the garrison with the Shadowforge lock.\n\n5) Head deeper into the dungeon and jump out of the window at the point where you cross the shadowforge gate (which should still be locked to you).&nbsp; When down below head towards incendius and you will see 4 packs of 2 elementals.&nbsp; Kill them all.&nbsp; Take incendius if you are able to solo him, failing that just stealth past him for a final two, thats us just about done.&nbsp; \n\n6) Head back the way you've just come and go through the forge gate and onto the Dark Iron Highway.&nbsp; There are 2 elementals patrolling here you can kill if you're feeling brave (destealthing on highway is risky) or follow them to the end by Bael'Gar where there is a clear spot to kill them.&nbsp; After this simply head for the exit thats just off the highway, reset the instance and start again.\n\nThis all takes about 15 mins so you can do so constantly without having to wait for the reset timer to go down every hour.&nbsp;

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Elite mobs drops more each time (I have had 4 in one drop). So, if you have 10 minutes to spare, go kill the 10 elite elementals close to Incendious. The are easily soloable (even though they always come in pairs) if you have decent fire resist. It gives maybe 1 core of element/minute spent, so the only restriction would be the instance cap. There are five more easily accessable elite frie dudes in the beginning of BRD, so 15 drop chances per reset and when they drop, they drop 2-4 core of element (this is, soloing it).<br /><br />A comment on prices of those AD turn-ins: On my server, its like 1g/item. Which is insane imo. Sure they are worth a bit, but at exalted, the epic reward takes 54 insignia. Which equates to 1620 items. No BOE on this server is worth that much... Well, we will see what the market makes of those prices.</div>
