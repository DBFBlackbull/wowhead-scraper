<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where else.<br />right?<br /><br />no probably not.... <br />Maybe buyable from the innkeeper if you have enough cenarion hold reputation.<br /><br />no. also not.<br />its a quest reward from the AQ opening questline</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It IS for some quest line of AQ, you have to get 20 deeprock salts and 20 goblin rocket fuels, then the person doing this quest gets the recipe.<br /><br />I'm not sure what happens after that part, something about going into MC I was told.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is a quest reward for the 4th or 5th step of the AQ scepter quest.&nbsp; One of the quests requires you to make a bunch of this for an NPC, and he gives the recipie as a reward.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Pixit, please do a little research before you bash people.&nbsp; If you looked into it. This is a part of a progression that starts in Cenarion Hold.&nbsp; It takes you to Broodlord in BWL to get his head.&nbsp; Then you have to talk to three dragons.<br /><br />This quest was not ment for your average player as everyone has been saying.&nbsp; It was ment as a guild effort to start the opening of AQ.<br /><br />The progression takes you into The Sunken Temple in Swamp of Sorrows, BWL, MC, and a multitude of other places.&nbsp; <br /><br />That is what the poster above was stating.&nbsp; My be a little misinformed, but altogether has the general idea.&nbsp; This quest in particular requires you to at least go into BWL to start the quest then do a couple chores before you can finish this part of the multiple quests that are related, but not directly effected by its demise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Getting this recipe isn't too hard compared to the rest of the AQ chain.&nbsp; You need the broodlord's head and at least Neutral with Brood of Nozdormu.<br /><br />This is part of the blue shard quest line, that's the Azueregos chain.&nbsp; Once you speak with the shade of Azueregos, he'll put you on a course to do this quest.&nbsp; Everything to get this recipe (after the broodlord of course) is soloable except Lakmaeran, and farming the chimaerok tenderloins.<br /><br />Lakmaeran is a raid kill, but not a big one, in fact a well-geared, well-rounded group can do him.&nbsp; The hardest part is getting people to actually help with the kill.&nbsp; We did it with 2 pallies, 2 locks, 1 priest, 1 druid and 1 warrior, mind you we were all tier 2, minimum.&nbsp; The kill was slow, but not hard.&nbsp; (Spread out for him.)&nbsp; He spawns about every 15-25 mins, and of course you can collect tenderloins while you're waiting.<br /><br />The really annoying part is collecting the 20 chimaerok tenderloins.&nbsp; The drop rate isn't great, but a group of 2-3 people can kill these L60+ elites.&nbsp; Some classes can even solo the smaller ones.<br /><br />So if you can get your guild/friends to help out with those two things, getting this epic recipe really is doable for anyone who can get the Broodlord's head. I'm actually surprised more people don't have it.<br /><br />The recipe is not BoP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have read the two previous post, but fail to understand who I need to talk to to start this quest.&nbsp; I have completed the desert dumpling quest in Sithilus and I am neutral(cenarion hold)/60/300 cooking.&nbsp; I don't see anything else.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Honko,<br />Are you sure there's no other steps between step 3 and 4? I'm revered with Brood but when I talk to Narain I don't get a quest option.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where is the start of this chain Quests?<br /><br />Anyone can explain where this start and all the steps pls <br /><br />Edited, Thu May 4 19:21:35 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Baristolth of the Shifting Sands gives you the quest.<br />He's in Silithius, near the horde gryph.<br /><br />Here are the quests/steps:<br /><br />1. What Tomorrow Brings (Venture to the Caverns of Time in Tanaris and find Anachronos)<br /><br />2. Only One May Rise (Return the Head of the Broodlord Lashlayer, 3rd boss in BWL)<br /><br />3. Build your reputation until at least Neutral with Brood of Nozdormu.<br /><br />4. Never Ask Me About My Business (Narain Soothfancy in Tanaris wants you to speak with Dirge Quickcleave in Gadgetzan)<br /><br />5. The Isle of Dread! (Recover Lakmaeran's Carcass and 20 Chimaerok Tenderloins for Dirge Quickcleave in Tanaris)<br /><br />6. Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok Chops (Dirge Quickcleave in Gadgetzan wants you to bring him 20 Goblin Rocket Fuel and 20 Deeprock Salt)<br /><br />7. Return to Narain Soothfancy in Tanaris (GRATZ)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The recipe is epic? What the hell is with that?<br /><br />I just remembered that Dirge was the cook in gadget where you do the artisan cooking quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is this item tradable?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>our guild got this the other day. 1 meat turns into 5 food. pretty sweet 25 stamina. too bad the quest is an above avg difficuly type thing. not to mention the 61-62 elites ya have to kill for the meat on the isle of dread.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Man wen I saw this in the AH for 2000g, my mouth dropped lol, an epic cooking recipe thats pretty awsome. The only thing i dont get is why would you spend 1000g on the recipe(if you get a good deal) and then spend around 4g a pop to make each of the bread things. To me the buffs on the food arnt worth those prices.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is used and obtained in the quest line to open AQ.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How do i get this item</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>+25 stamina when well fed you wont see food like that on vendors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LAWL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, according to this page only 4 have been sold... And the median price is 10000g! And now my question is... IS THERE REALLY ANYONE WHO HAS THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd love to know where this drops, I suspect we'll see some farmers with it up for 2000g soon, simply because it's purple... heh...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LAWL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>And if there is... DO THEY SPEND IT ON COOKING RECIPES?<br />Is it mental or is it just me? :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>its BoE Nubs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SeekerWi</b></h3>So this is tradeable I assume? I'd be more than interested to buy that from someone clearing the questline...</div>
