var lv_comments0 = [{"commentv2":1,"number":0,"id":2687084,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Well to start your journey, after getting the quest in Stormwind, head to Menethil Harbor, just Northwest of Ironforge. Once there, go to the LEFT side of the docks, and take the next boat that shows up. Once the boat reaches the next destination, Thelsamore, follow along the road, all the way into the Berrens, and down towards Thousand Needles. At the BORDER, right before The Great Lift, take a RIGHT, and you are there. If that doesn't work...just stay on the right side, on the wall, until you come to it. It should be about 40-50 yards from The Great Lift.\n\nAlso, all the creatures there used to be just Regular Level 22-28's, but Blizzard found that that was too easy and changed them ALL to Elites. So make sure that you get AT THE LEAST 1 lvl 35+ with you. Or, 3-4 lvl 30-34's. If you don't have that, you CANNOT make it through there.

Once there, go to the LEFT side of the docks, and take the next boat that shows up. Once the boat reaches the next destination, Thelsamore, follow along the road, all the way into the Berrens, and down towards Thousand Needles. At the BORDER, right before The Great Lift, take a RIGHT, and you are there. If that doesn't work...just stay on the right side, on the wall, until you come to it. It should be about 40-50 yards from The Great Lift.<br /><br />Also, all the creatures there used to be just Regular Level 22-28's, but Blizzard found that that was too easy and changed them ALL to Elites. So make sure that you get AT THE LEAST 1 lvl 35+ with you. Or, 3-4 lvl 30-34's. If you don't have that, you CANNOT make it through there. I was a Level 26 Dwarf Warrior with a Level 30 Rogue, and we did not make it very far...UNTIL we got 2 Level 42 friends...so make sure you either have a big group, or a High Level Person with you.&nbsp; Hope this helps :)</div>

It says it drops 34% of the time, but we had no luck. Anyone else having this much bad luck? :)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 2nd 2006 at 7:09am EDT by harrywallis</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>goFeroc</b></h3>I solo'd Roogug and the way up to him (Human Warrior lvl 35). just pull the mobs one by one and they fall pretty easy (hamstring also works wonders below 20%). Had a Fiery War Axe as a 2h though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ZyleneIT</b></h3>Hardcore Solo challenge, did it as a 32 warrior with no special gear, full green, for the class quest.<br />The elites until Roogug are fairly easy, casters are a bit sketchy because they do a 10 sec frost nova and spam Frostbolt but at 32 the resist chance is high.<br />They run so hamstring is your friend here, to avoid them to friendly aggro.<br /><br />The hardest part is Roogug because with him you will also pull the caster near it and his elemental.<br />My strategy was to clear everything up to him, including the patrol on the right near the entrance, get full rage, pull Roogug with ranged and quickly run near the instance entrance for a quick exit if things go bad.<br />Sweeping Strike and Cleave them down focusing the Caster add first.<br />Had to pot mid fight and also used a target dummy just to be safe but isn't required.</div>
