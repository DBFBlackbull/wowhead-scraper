For an aspiring, levelling engineer this is quite a gem.<br />Not only is the bot a fair boost on DPS up to mobs level 35'ish once dead they can be looted for fused wiring.<br /><br />The downsides is they are quite agressive and should not be brought to areas where careful pulling is a must (instances).<br />They can also not be healed, though there is an engineering item that can be used to heal them with.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have Engineering 180, but can't find any horde trainer who want to teach me this. Do you need to be lvl35 to learn this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>no you dont need to be level 35, though maybe the trainer just can't teach you that high of a schematic, idk but just keep looking for someone else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know where the trainer is who can train this skill. I've tried the trainers in:<br /><br />Orgrimmer<br />Ratchet<br />Booty Bay<br />Undercity<br />gadgetztan<br /><br />or is it just that they have an issue with me being lvl27</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All the other sheeps, harvest reaper, machanical dragonling, you can only have ONE summon out. So you can't get like 1 sheep out and one harvest reaper, only one or the other at a time.<br /><br />If you read the top, there is a list of items that share the same cooldown of each other. Meaning you can only have one summon out at any time.<br /><br />Still with 3 damage pets, though hunters are a little annoying because of their nerfs, it makes up by making you look very cool. Couple this with camp fire making, trap laying, and you can pretty much build your own base camp and ambush area :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First, thank you to Jamoo for that excellent tactical summary. The note about these and other &quot;guardian&quot; units acting like Hunter/Warlock pets on &quot;aggressive&quot; mode is a very important point to remember for anyone using one of these or a similar thing.<br /><br />Why very sad? Because I <i>loved</i> my Compact Harvest Reapers but I've been 60 for a long time and they are now totally useless. Compare this to a Mechanical Dragonling or Battle Chicken: Although their hit points do not scale up, they are &quot;summoned&quot; at a level proportional to the owners Engineering expertise (Engineering/5, so at Engineer 300 a Dragonling is Level 60). Therefore, if they are the target, they die fast but at least they don't suffer from the level difference. But the Reapers are always Level 35 no matter your own level and so they both die fast if they are the target of a Level 50+ creep <i>and</i> only rarely can get a normal hit in on such a target themselves.<br /><br />I still have a Mechanical Dragonling (not Mithril, not Arcanite... the lowest-level one) and it remains useful for scoring a little extra damage; I just have to be sure it doesn't pull any aggro because, although it appears at Level 60, it has the same hit points it did when I was Level 35. I'd love to see an Advanced Compact Harvest Reaper Kit. I miss my Reapers...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, those things are also good vs hunters. They only have 1m cooldown (after its destroyed) and you can use them to eat the hunter's freeze trap. <br />However, if you are a rogue this thing will break your blind and gouge and that sucks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wow, no one has comment on this yet?<br /><br />It is a fantastic item if you need that extra little dps boost. Useful for quite a while until it starts getting one shotted by mobs, then it becomes pretty useless.<br /><br />Best thing about it is, after it dies you can loot most of your mats back off of it, and sometimes even a fused wireing, which is extremely worthwhile.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So did anyone really find a trainer that teaches it? Where is he? Any major city? What zone?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those of you that said you can not have this out and a mechainical dragon at same time are wrong.&nbsp; Im a lvl 39 hunter and you CAN have the dragon, the reaper and a pet at same time.&nbsp; As for usefullness i managed to take down a lvl 39 pally and a lvl 39 druid in BG at the same time by my self.&nbsp; These guys wernt noobs but wheres traps that limit there moement and you got three things on you its not that easy.&nbsp; As for stackable yes they are.&nbsp; I carry a stack of 3 but not sure maxs stat size.&nbsp; After 10 mintues they die.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What happens to the Reaper when you die?&nbsp; After I rez'd, I could not find the Reaper to loot.&nbsp; Very expensive way to die.&nbsp; Any thoughts (other than don't die)?<br /><br />Rourke</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hey where do u learn to use?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Its only one use like stated, summons a lvl 35 reaper thats actually pretty nice, he hits fast and can take aggro fairly well its already saved my butt a couple of times and since you can make it at lvl 30 a lvl 35 pet is very nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is the best way for owning rogues on 21-30 pvp, Especially if you have no AoE spells or items. As a druid i usually just stealthed through midfield since there was usually 2-3 rogues just pwning everyone but once i hit 30 i just travel formed out to mid field. took up camp and let him loose. since hes 35 he can see anything lower than him and most rogues are usually 28- so he was having a field day. it especially pissed them off when i waited right outside their graveyard and watched the rogues run down and stealth. i just cast natures grasp in case one hit me and he went nuts on the others. seriously this will make you &quot;that pain in the a$$ &lt;class&gt;&quot; til you get bumped out of first bracket pvp. its also great for druids and rogues soloing the flag cause you can just run to second floor summon him, stealth and drop down. when you drop he will run around the outside and come in other way while you grab flag and haul butt out graveyard entrance. same with exploding sheep too. its a nice distraction for a good 3-4 seconds, just make sure you have a freeaction and swiftness potion on hand just in case. Also for all those trash talking rogues up to about 33 you can duel their brains out cause it takes alot to kill those harvesters. i have nothing against rogues but i just hate them without my AoEs.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Aug 28 22:55:40 2005</div>
