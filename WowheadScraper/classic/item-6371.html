Once the schools are done just waste some time and they'll be back again. <br /><br />I was around 80-90 fishing skill when i started here. <br /><br />Bonus: Since SS is always under attack when you're sitting under the docks fishing the horde usually don't notice you so there's nothing to worry about. After an hour of fishing through constant level 70 attacks I was only killed once. <br /><br />That doesn't mean I don't help take them out but my little 29 warlock can't do much against a 70. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can't buy Fire Oil from a vendor but a mid lvl alchemist can make it for you. Try /say LF Alch. WTB Fire Oil.</div>
