<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It doesn't matter who drops the clam, the drop rate of pearls is dependent on the clam, not who dropped the clam.<br /><br />Now it's possible that some mobs drop clams more often than others, but there is no mob that drops super-special Big-Mouth Clams that have a higher percentage of pearls inside. Doesn't take Capt Obvious to realize that. Think about it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These are the correct drop rate for each pearl gained from a Big-mouth Clam:<br /><br />- <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1672">Small Lustrous Pearl</a><br />- <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3308">Iridescent Pearl</a> 2.5% 1/40<br />- <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4576">Black Pearl</a> 4.0% 1/25<br />- <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4265">Golden Pearl</a> 0.5% 1/200<br /><br />The average drop rate for a Big-mouth clam is 33% 1/3 kills<br /><br />So statistically it takes <b>200*3=600 kills</b> for 1 Golden Pearl<br /><br />Do whatever you want to do with this information, but I'm not gonna grind Golden Pearls anymore, since they are 10-15g on my server.<br />And 10-15g is easy to make anywhere else in less time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Big waste of time.&nbsp; Easier to farm something else and pay the 30g for the pearl.&nbsp; I spent 3 hours in STV and 2 hours in Ashara and received nothing but a load of crap clam meat, 3silver per kill, and (3) green items.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was after a Golden Pearl so I kept track of the drops.<br /><br />Didn't keep track of mobs killed. Drop rate was about 1 in 3 for the clams from the Spitelash Serpent mobs at the ruins Azshara. <br /><br />In 37 clams I found: 2 Small Lustrous, 1 Iridescent, 1 Black (came with a Sm. Lustrous), and in the last clam, 1 Golden Pearl.<br /><br />Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>&quot;Farming turtles that roam the beaches are a good source of the Big-mouth Clams, they are non agressive and can be skinned, but they drop no coin.&quot; FYI The Speckled Shell Fragments I get off of turtles in tanaris sell for 9s. Whenever you want money from grinding you should loot everything and vendor anything that you aren't using or putting on AH. Any items marked as grey are meant for vendoring.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Because of the lack of statistics what drops from these clams, I farmed a few and took notes of the pearls I found. During the farming of these clams I also got a few uncommon items which I sold at the AH.<br /><br />Total number of clams: 100<br />4 x black pearl - 4%<br />3 x iridescent pearl - 3%<br />1 x small lustrous pearl - 1%<br />1 x golden pearl - 1%<br /><br />I may update this post if I keep farming these. I felt really lucky as the golden pearl was the 23rd clam I opened, but unfortunately the drop rate was not every 23rd.. :)<br /><br />And I don't think it makes any difference, but I farmed the clams from nagas in the Ruins of Solarsal, Feralas.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Feb 17 02:58:39 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Although pearls can drop from any of the mobs that drop Big-mouth Clams, the clams themselves are the main source of Pearls: Small Lustrous Pearl, Iridescent Pearl, Black Pearl, and Golden Pearl.<br /><br />The Lustrous and Iridescent pearls can also be found in other types of clams, on lower level mobs. <br /><br />After opening many thousand Big-mouth Clams, I've gotten 7 Golden, 63 Black, and a smattering of the Lustrous and Iridescent ones.<br /><br />Farming turtles that roam the beaches are a good source of the Big-mouth Clams, they are non agressive and can be skinned, but they drop no coin. Farming the crab and murloc humanoid types also drop the Big-mouth Clams and coin, but they are agressive.<br /><br />For me, the humanoid types tend to drop more Green and Blue items for good AH cash, but I've gotten an epic from each type. I tend to enjoy farming the humanoid types and the beach at the eastern edge of Azshara is huge with a very wide range of mobs and areas to hunt. The Azshara beaches will also support a goodly number of farmers unlike other areas that are quite small.</div>
