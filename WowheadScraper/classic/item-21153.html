<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found that you could fish the regular Sagefish in any watery area of Ashenvale. <br /><br />I also found a lot of regular Sagefish spots dotted up the river that is just east of Southshore in Hillsbrad.<br /><br />There is around 5-8 Greater Sagefish spawn spots in the Lake Nezeriti (or something) in Stranglethorn Vale. I've fished around 100 or so there today, the spawn spots reappear pretty good if you're there questing aswell. I would guess it'd take longer for the spots to come back if you're just there to farm the fish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just seen three schools in the river right above Nessinwary's Expedition</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Fished two schools right out in front of Nancy's cabin on Lake Lordamere while doing the Vorrel's Revenge quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There are not any in the Lake. They are only Sagefish Schools. Greater Sagefish only exist in STV as of this date.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Greater Sagefish can be fished from the western side of Alterac Mountains now. The simplest way to get to the right spot (for Horde, anyway) is to fly to Silverpine and go east across the lake. There are several Greater Sagefish nodes on the shore next to Dalaran (the big pink dome), and further north along the Misty Shore and that whole area.<br /><br />There are hostile mobs in the buildings in this area, including one 33 elite in a house, so watch out for that. But for the most part, it's just passive turtles. Certainly safer than anywhere in STV, and less chance of getting ganked if you're on a PvP server.<br /><br />I went up and down this coastline just once, fishing all the nodes until they were empty, and came back with a stack of Greater Sagefish, as well as some cloth and leather from the Floating Wreckage nodes. Nice spot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is several schools on Misty Shore. Need about 135 fishing, but without a bauble you'll need to skill up a little. <br /><br />As for the guy $%^&amp;*ing about locs in STV, how about you read the posts above you. Nessinwary's is right on a river. There are many schools of fish on the river that run through STV. Just follow the water man.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can greater sagefish be fished from 'sagefish schools' or must you specifically find&nbsp; agreater sagefish school?<br /><br />if not, then theres at least 10 sageish schools up and down the river in hillsbrad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did about 45 minutes fishing in Lordamere Lake on the Misty Shore trying to get to lvl 150 on my fishing skills. I only fished in the schools of Raw Greater Sagefish.This is what I caught:<br /><br />4 Iron bound trunks (nothing much inside - a few weak potions and some various pieces of cloth)<br />14 Raw Bristle Whiskere Catfish<br />16 Raw Mithril Head Trout<br />6 Stranglekelp<br />23 Raw Greater Sagefish<br /><br />That's a drop rate of about 36%.<br /><br />happy fishing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're low, sure, alterac is the best, but if you're 50-60 go fish in stv. start at the top and work&nbsp; your way down both sides of the river next to grom gol. <br /><br />aside from that, here's the best way to locate pools- swim underwater. you can miss pools from the top, but you can clearly see them from below. try it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I took the advice of a few of the above posters and ran along Lordamere Lake in Alterac.&nbsp; Found about 12 schools and fished this out of them in approximately an hour.<br /><br />69 Greater Sagefish<br />5 Rumsey Rum<br />5 trunks (all with either/or heavy leather, healing/mana potions, silk and money in them)<br />7 stranglekelp<br />Added 24 points to my fishing skill (136-160)<br /><br />The only mobs around were in fact the turtles, but like one of the posters said, be careful around a house out there or those elites will eat you for dinner (if you're a level 30 like me anyway).</div>
