<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of when, I don't know, but it is now inside the wall and guarded by 2 elite murlocks. I would suggest bringing a friend, maybe a warlock, because you will be down there for a bit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I saw something interesting when i was down there... Its two of the same tablet! One outside the wall and one inside! Take the one outside and forget the murlocks!<br /><br /><b>Lisanda out!</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey! Just like Lisanda said, there are 2 tablets so beware.<br /><br /> /<br /> |<br /> |<br /> |&nbsp; &nbsp; A<br /> | <b>.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>.</b><br /> \__<u>1</u>_&nbsp; &nbsp; _____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2<br /><br />A = glowing alter<br /><b>.</b> = elite murloc<br />1 = tablet inside the wall (don't get this one)<br />2 = tablet OUTSIDE the wall &quot;&quot;Gri'lek the Wanderer&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Just swim from the shore near all the ruins where the other troll legends are to the larger of the 2 islands. In between the island and the shore you'll see the sunken city. Find the purple glowing alter. Orientate yourself so you're mirroring the map above. Swim down OUTSIDE the perimeter wall to the tablet. Et viola! No fights. No hassle. ;)<br /><br />Peace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a 34 druid, I found where the tablet was (the tablet outside the ruins) then went into cat form, stealthed down to it, shifted back into human, read the tablet, hit water form and was out, no problem, no attacks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its correct that's for sure but yes i had difficulty finding it...&nbsp; swim out to the sunken city... you'll see the Glowing Alter...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have read most of the above posts and i got it on my first try with my lvl 34 rogue, all i had to do was stealth down to the outside tablet and BANG i was done, couldnt have done it without knowing where it was and how i could easily get it tho. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Nessx</div>
