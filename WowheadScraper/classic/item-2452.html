You'll see that it's worth a lot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4283</b></h3>East of Loch Modan, you can go from north to south getting briarthorn/swiftthistle drops, then by the time you make your way around to go north again or so, it respawns in nearly the same places.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>iammercy</b></h3>The south part of Silverpine Forest will net you a good 5-10 of each Briarthorn and Mageroyal. Briarthorn is a better source of Swiftthistle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7786</b></h3>For any alchemists/herbalists (even lower level players with at least 60 alchemy skill) wishing to make some extra spending gold, making Swiftness Potion out of Swiftthistle is one good way to do this. Here's some helpful hints to get started:<br /><br />1. Either find or buy the recipe for Swiftness Potion. I've never had a problem finding it, but if you already have sufficient funds and don't want to wait, you can put up a good amount of gold and get it off the AH. If you choose to farm for it, it's a world drop but seems to be found mainly in chests.<br /><br />2. Go to either Westfall (alliance) or Silverpine Forest (horde) and watch your mini-map for any herbs that may come up. Mageroyal and Briarthorn plants both have a chance of containing Swiftthistle.<br /><br />3. Once you've farmed a decent supply of both Briarthorn and Swiftthistle, make your Swiftness Potions and put them up on the AH. Unless inflation has your server by it's toes, the pots should sell for right around a gold a piece. Swiftness potions is highly sought after by all levels mainly for using in pvp.<br /><br />Good farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shadowsonic32</b></h3>Can be selled for a high price at the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7828</b></h3>Note that Swiftthistle does not appear on its own. It has a chance to appear when you gather Briarthorn or Mageroyal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8557</b></h3>Swiftthistle is also used in Thistle Tea (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7676">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7676</a>) which is for rogues only -- pretty nice for PvP for a little extra burst dps or end-game raiding when you mess up your cycle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this Aloe Vera plant in my office, ever since playing this game I have a hard time not harvesting it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So when you pick Briarthorn or Mageroyal (Herbalism skill) you have a chance of also getting Swiftthistle.&nbsp; Since I wrote the above, the price of a stack of 20 Swiftthistle on the AH has soared to about 4g, or 20s per unit.&nbsp; Since this drops in low level areas like Westfall and Loch Modan, That means a level 15 character can easily make 10-20g in one day of harvesting.&nbsp; Crazy, and absolutely unbalanced.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>East of Loch Modan, you can go from north to south getting briarthorn/swiftthistle drops, then by the time you make your way around to go north again or so, it respawns in nearly the same places.&nbsp; In about 2 hours you get quite a bit. If that's not your cup of tea (heh heh), instead of paying at the AH, why don't you pay a lowbie to farm it for you?&nbsp; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>almost every time i pick mageroyal, i get swiftthistle - on kel' thuzad, it sells about 5 for 2g so i can make 2g in a couple minutes with my 18 paladin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just asked around for the locations, my lvl 60 mage is a herbalist so just get her to farm for my lowbie rogue, problem solved, am I hell paying 5g for 20 pieces on my server's AH! (Bloodhoof)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>About tea:<br />This tea is extremly usfull for a rogue, its not hard to play without but its a big + to use it e.g u can kill clothwearers with 2-3 hits in no-time.<br /><br />About price: Ofc its expensive. Its all about supply and demand, for example, with a high demand (almost every rogue that pvp needs it) and a low supply (its hard to find and it should be, it shouldnt drop all the time when you pick mageroylal etc). So one way to get prices down is to put a higher drop rate, then more herbers would be able to sell, the supply will expand and prices go down. easy as that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There are two use of this herb:<br /><br />1. Thistle tea for rogue<br /><br />2. Run speed potion of WSG.<br /><br />Hence the price = 1g/piece on greymane.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dont really see why rogues need the tea so much (I am a rogue myself and I manage fine without it), I would rather use it for swiftness potion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just stealth, cheapshot, sinister strike, drink thistle tea, more sinisters, rupture, and walk away. Oh yeah...and wave goodbye</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i made alot of money off this herb. not only is it used for rogues tea it's used alot in the lower level potions for battle grounds. I've been selling these for 10G/stack and they always sell.<br /><br />Swiftthistle = 10G/stack<br />Kingsblood = 4G/stack<br />Briarthorn = 2G50S/stack<br /><br />these always sell and are great for helping you at lower levels at getting the needed funds to purchase your mounts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Playing a 60 Rogue here.<br /><br />20 Swiftthistle = 20g on my server<br /><br />Advice: Level a Hunter to 20 bc of the speed, lvl herbalism a bit and farm all the briarthorn / mageroyal you can find in the lowbie areas.<br /><br /> :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On Ursin, swiftthistle and fadeleaf go for anywhere from 5-15g a stack.&nbsp; The worse thing is we are low-pop and filled with farmers.&nbsp; <br /><br />For horde, the best place to farm for lowbies are circles around mulgore and around mountains in the barrens.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hiddenhorror- Horde rogue on Ursin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Looking to buy alot of this in bulk on Warsong server. Whisper or mail Tinrack for details.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Good place for those in their 15's-20's is Darkshore near Aburdine. The woods are crawling with Mageroyal and Briarthorns aren't hard to find either. Plus free rides to Darnassus, which is good profiting.</div>
