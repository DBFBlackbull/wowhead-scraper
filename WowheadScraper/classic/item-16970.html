First a word on getting there:\n\nI went from Grom Gol Base Camp north to Duskwood. Crept around the ridgeline in Duskwood to avoid Allys, only got bother by critters a couple of times and was able to escape. Went east into Deadwind Pass. Although Deadwind was the most dangerous area for me level-wise, I never saw a single living thing. Then went east into the Swamp of Sorrows.\n\nOnce I picked up the flight point at Stonard, I went southeast into the swamp. This was the most difficult part as I was vastly out-leveled by almost everything. I prowled most of the way and was very careful in picking my route... very dangerous and very time consuming.\n\nOnce through, the coords 94,39 were dead on. I stood on the southernmost log to avoid the Monstrous Crawlers (don't know if they would have attacked or not). After that, I caught the Mahi on my 1st cast with no bait at all.\n\nMy advice, if you're low level and solo... use your Hearthstone to get out.","date":"2006-06-19T04:04:52-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"jdmckinnon","importedSubject":"Easy and hard for a Hordie"},{"commentv2":1,"number":18,"id":2649817,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"For those of you who don't use Coords, here's a simple way to do this quest:\n\nFirst you should know that to get this quest the minimum requirements is to be level 35 and at a fishing skill of 225.\n\nSecond after you are 35 with skill 225 all you have to do is go to Nat Pagle in Dustwallow marsh, hes on a small island west of Theramore Isle.\n\nThird all you need to do to catch these fish is have the name of where they mention in the quest above your minimap, anywhere inside that area is fine to catch them.\n\nNow for the quest:\n\nSavage Coast Blue Sailfin - This fish needs to be caught in Stranglethorn Vale. Now there are two places one is called SOUTHERN Savage Coast, and the other is just Savage Coast, you must be at Savage Coast to catch this fish and that is near the Grom'gol base camp (which is horde Ugh. lol) After you catch that fish Run up to darkshire and follow the road that takes you east out of town and head east through Deadwind Pass following the road to Swamp of Sorrows.\n\nMisty Reed Mahi Mahi - This one is in Swamp of Sorrows (which is East of Darkshire). It's at the very south eastern most part of the zone past the Sunken Temple of Attal'Hakkar and threw some lvl 45+ dragonkin. Now when you get all the way over here i went out into the water at the South West part and there are three islands, one of which you still stay in the Misty Reed and can fish off of without Murlocs trying to pester you. The other two islands however are just barely out of the area so make sure you are still in Misty Reed or you'll never see that fish. From here you can either die and spirit res at Graveyard near stoneard or walk here then walk south into Blasted lands where alliance can fly from Nethergarde Keep (Northeast part of map) up to Menethil harbor to venture to the other continent. Take the boat over to Theramore Isle, Dustwallow Marsh, then fly to Desolace.\n\nSar'theris Striker - This fish is in Desolace near another horde town called Shadowprey village and it's pretty far south near the zone to Feralas and west of the Gelkis clan over on that coast. After you catch this fish back track a lil past Gelkis clan area and follow the road that takes you South into Feralas.\n\nFeralas Ahi - there's a Horde town (lol horde must really like fishing or something) in the middle of Feralas which has a river running along side of it, thats Verdantis River and since i'm Alliance i just went a little way downstream and caught it.\n\nAfter you've done all that head to whichever Flight path you think is closest there is one to the east of you and to the west of you in Feralas, I went to Feathermoon Stronghold and flew back to Dustwallow Marsh, Where i went and saw Nat Pagle and completed the quest. Now i can sit back and fish all the way to 300.\n\nWell i hope this guide helped. And good luck fishing!\n\nThis was posted by Quicklet: 39 Night Elf, Hunter of Burning Blade.","date":"2006-06-19T04:04:52-05:00","rating":45,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Quicklet","importedSubject":"Alliance Based Artisan Fishing Guide"},{"commentv2":1,"number":19,"id":2649829,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Caught it off the turtle shell on the \nnorthern coastline\ncasted southeast \ntook about 10 min","date":"2006-07-25T16:04:52-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"foshizzo","importedSubject":"fishy"},{"commentv2":1,"number":20,"id":2649841,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Moved all over the coast for this one, even tried \"between the logs\" and that didn't help.&nbsp; Doesn't matter where you stand as posters above have said.&nbsp; Took me about 55 casts, so I'd guess about a 2% drop rate.&nbsp; Long story short, just be patient.","date":"2007-04-07T04:04:52-05:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Vanessae","importedSubject":"Moved all over the c..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":21,"id":2649853,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Even with a big iron fishpole and +100 lure i got over 120 fish in total before i got this q finished... and i really tried to fish where all recommended it, at different times a day.

I was at 94,39. <br /><br />If you don't have coords, it's about at the middle of the Strand. The right area will look like this: You are standing on the beach between two dead logs that reach into the water. One log to the north and one to the south (one to your left, one to your right). To the SE there is a HUGE empty turtle shell on the beach. Took me about 7 casts to get the Mahi.</div>

Check this out:<br /><br />Pat Nagle was credited on a game as early as 1998 and as recently as 2004. His/Her career probably spans more years than those displayed since these dates are based on the credits documented in MobyGames (which are incomplete). Pat Nagle has been credited with the roles Support, Quality Assurance, Design and Other. Pat Nagle has been credited on games developed by the following companies: Blizzard Entertainment and Saffire.

I'm on a pvp team so i'm constantly in the raid.<br /><br />Lo and behold, when I drop the raid, upon my first cast, I catch the Mahi.<br /><br />/tar Baurius<br />/fishSlap</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I saved this for last cause it required the most travel. First a word on getting there:<br /><br />I went from Grom Gol Base Camp north to Duskwood. Crept around the ridgeline in Duskwood to avoid Allys, only got bother by critters a couple of times and was able to escape. Went east into Deadwind Pass. Although Deadwind was the most dangerous area for me level-wise, I never saw a single living thing. Then went east into the Swamp of Sorrows.<br /><br />Once I picked up the flight point at Stonard, I went southeast into the swamp. This was the most difficult part as I was vastly out-leveled by almost everything. I prowled most of the way and was very careful in picking my route... very dangerous and very time consuming.<br /><br />Once through, the coords 94,39 were dead on. I stood on the southernmost log to avoid the Monstrous Crawlers (don't know if they would have attacked or not). After that, I caught the Mahi on my 1st cast with no bait at all.<br /><br />My advice, if you're low level and solo... use your Hearthstone to get out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those of you who don't use Coords, here's a simple way to do this quest:<br /><br />First you should know that to get this quest the minimum requirements is to be level 35 and at a fishing skill of 225.<br /><br />Second after you are 35 with skill 225 all you have to do is go to Nat Pagle in Dustwallow marsh, hes on a small island west of Theramore Isle.<br /><br />Third all you need to do to catch these fish is have the name of where they mention in the quest above your minimap, anywhere inside that area is fine to catch them.<br /><br />Now for the quest:<br /><br />Savage Coast Blue Sailfin - This fish needs to be caught in Stranglethorn Vale. Now there are two places one is called SOUTHERN Savage Coast, and the other is just Savage Coast, you must be at Savage Coast to catch this fish and that is near the Grom'gol base camp (which is horde Ugh. lol) After you catch that fish Run up to darkshire and follow the road that takes you east out of town and head east through Deadwind Pass following the road to Swamp of Sorrows.<br /><br />Misty Reed Mahi Mahi - This one is in Swamp of Sorrows (which is East of Darkshire). It's at the very south eastern most part of the zone past the Sunken Temple of Attal'Hakkar and threw some lvl 45+ dragonkin. Now when you get all the way over here i went out into the water at the South West part and there are three islands, one of which you still stay in the Misty Reed and can fish off of without Murlocs trying to pester you. The other two islands however are just barely out of the area so make sure you are still in Misty Reed or you'll never see that fish. From here you can either die and spirit res at Graveyard near stoneard or walk here then walk south into Blasted lands where alliance can fly from Nethergarde Keep (Northeast part of map) up to Menethil harbor to venture to the other continent. Take the boat over to Theramore Isle, Dustwallow Marsh, then fly to Desolace.<br /><br />Sar'theris Striker - This fish is in Desolace near another horde town called Shadowprey village and it's pretty far south near the zone to Feralas and west of the Gelkis clan over on that coast. After you catch this fish back track a lil past Gelkis clan area and follow the road that takes you South into Feralas.<br /><br />Feralas Ahi - there's a Horde town (lol horde must really like fishing or something) in the middle of Feralas which has a river running along side of it, thats Verdantis River and since i'm Alliance i just went a little way downstream and caught it.<br /><br />After you've done all that head to whichever Flight path you think is closest there is one to the east of you and to the west of you in Feralas, I went to Feathermoon Stronghold and flew back to Dustwallow Marsh, Where i went and saw Nat Pagle and completed the quest. Now i can sit back and fish all the way to 300.<br /><br />Well i hope this guide helped. And good luck fishing!<br /><br />This was posted by Quicklet: 39 Night Elf, Hunter of Burning Blade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Caught it off the turtle shell on the <br />northern coastline<br />casted southeast <br />took about 10 min</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Moved all over the coast for this one, even tried &quot;between the logs&quot; and that didn't help.&nbsp; Doesn't matter where you stand as posters above have said.&nbsp; Took me about 55 casts, so I'd guess about a 2% drop rate.&nbsp; Long story short, just be patient.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Even with a big iron fishpole and +100 lure i got over 120 fish in total before i got this q finished... and i really tried to fish where all recommended it, at different times a day. Only feralas i got after 5 casts - worst was this nice little mahi mahi with 58 fishes before i got him up. A big thank to my patient guild friends helping me alive through the swamps and watching over me to return saveguarded.<br /><br />At least my cooking got up. All fish recipes are grey now... and cooking is at 270+<br /><br />So just dont give up :))</div>

I finally broke down and checked allakhazam to see where I needed to fish. It said 90,73. I had been fishing at 89, 73 for about 10 minutes, caught maybe 20 firefin snappers and such. I moved the two steps east to 90, 73 and got the Mahi Mahi on my first cast.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On my Horde 'toon, I left Stonard explorer camp and headed to the coast. I turned left and followed the ridge along the beach, skirting behind the murlocs until I spotted a 42 elite dragonkin thing up ahead. I scooted down to the beach and stood on the water's edge between 2 murloc camps. The camps were just far enough apart that I didn't aggro murlocs in either of them. The camp on my right had a hut-looking thing on top of a dead turtle corpse. I caught the fish on the 3rd cast using Nat Pagler's fancy fishing pole (reward from the Hinterlands quest) and no lure.</div>

Just follow the road, kill the level mid-30 mods along the road, avoid the Horde pats. As you near the shore, the mobs jump to about 40. Be careful here. Stand on the beach and done!</div>

Maybe some kind of different RNG on the last fish of the quest since it talks about &quot;you need to be determined&quot; to &quot;sit on your duff for hours at a time, doin' nothin'.&quot;</div>
