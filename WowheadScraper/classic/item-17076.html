Even the maintank can tank Ragnaros with 31 points in arms. And i should know, cause i maintanked him.\nWe have a DKP system, but we decide first which items benefits what class the most. That means a DPS Warrior that does not tank in Molten Core, besides Majordomo, can use such a weapon in PvE and in PvP. A Paladin is a pure buff and healing character in raids and in PvP to be honest, he is not the damage dealing powerhouse that a warrior can be. A paladin won't die, that's right, but he won't kill anybody either. \nTo the people that say this would be a hunter weapon too, sry guys, but that is wrong.

And hell if everyone on the raid had one, the next man down would be a hunter, but lets be fair guys in the time it takes you to swing this puppy....against a melee class, you should already be dead!\n\nOn Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying it says Paladin\/Warrior only. Thats because Paladins are a melee, gear dependant class, most of which due to some run ins with the nerf bat and poor alternative talents, are 2 hand using retribution specced. And that means we use Seal of Command.\n\nSeal of Command is a buff that adds a damage dealing proc to your weapon. This damage is dealt as holy (so ignores armor) but can be dodged, missed like a melee attack, it cannot be parried or blocked, because it ignores armor.\n\nThe damage dealt by the seal is determined by weapon damage, the faster and weaker hitting the weapon, the weaker the holy damage dealt. Not only this but seal of command procs on a per minute basis, not 2\/5 swings, but in a period of say 1 minute you will have proc'd with seal of command 3 times 4-5 at the very most.\n\nSO! the slower the weapon speed the better because:\n\na) The Holy damage will be more (with a weapon like this you are gonna see about an added damage of 500-600)\n\nb)This is a slow weapon, therefore with a per minute based proc there is greater likely hood of a proc on each swing, rather than loads of weak swings and an occasional weak proc. We have Strong powerful swings with massive dmg dealing procs that will go off probably every 1\/3 swings with this thing.\n\nPaladins are a gear dependant class like any warrior, to stop them from rolling on a weapon like this is utter lunacy. However my argument is entirely vouched upon the fact I am retribution specced, and proof of this on the roll can be given by Blessing of Kings\/Seal of command\/Vengeance. How good this would be in the hands of holy\/prot spec I cannot say.\n\nThere is no legitimate reason other than the fact Warriors are being angry, bitter, jealous little kids who simply want to try and eliminate more competition on the rolls.\n\nAny Warrior wanna see if they can take me down?

With 3 stacks you can remove 2100 of that with the sword alone.\nAnd it procs a lot. I've had situations where I've charged a target, have it proc on the first autoswing and then proc again a fraction of a second later when I use [spell=23890], so that I start a fight with 2 stacks up. From people that have tested it, it seems to have a procrate of 2 procs per minute from autoattacks only. This will of course mean that it is much higher once you start using abilities as well.\n\nThe problem is that using raid debuffs you can already remove up to 3395 armor from the boss, with 5x [spell=11597], [spell=9907] and [spell=11717], which only leaves 355 on the target (which can be removed by a single stack of the swords proc). On private servers the bosses had much more armor making BRE legendary, that is where its reputation stems from. In Classic it is still great, just not as insane as rumors from private servers made it out to be.\n\nImportant to note: the proc is a buff for the user ([spell=21153]) and not a debuff on the target.\n\nIt is a very popular weapon for PvP but also great for 2h Fury in PvE, the only downside is that it is very rare.","date":"2020-03-02T07:46:37-06:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"lackluster look?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hi there.<br /><br />I just got this sword and i am a pally of the DPS variety.&nbsp; Now before you go and have an crazy heart attack that a pally is weilding this weapon... STOP.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; What i have to say is more important.<br /><br />Normally everyone puts on the +25 agility enchant or +damage or crusader on weapons like these.&nbsp; This one is different.&nbsp; <br /><br />The proc lasts for 10 secs and grants you harder hits.&nbsp; If you note the speed of the weapon, it is 3.4secs and in 3 swings takes 10.2 secs.&nbsp; This means you just miss out on the third swing of the proc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now with the iron counterweight you reduce the attack speed by 3%.&nbsp; The creates a situation where it takes 9.9 secs for 3 swings.&nbsp; This allows you to get that all important third swing in while the proc is up.<br /><br />But is this better than +25 agility - 1.25% crit chance.<br /><br />I beileve it is.&nbsp; This third swing gives you more chance that the proc is extended by an extra 10 secs and the effetiveness is doubled.&nbsp; Also, you gain the extra damage that the weapon does at this new speed.&nbsp; The faster weapon speed may not make the sword proc more often (not sure what the blizzard science is on procs) but it is the extending of the proc and the extra swing while the proc is up and running that is important.<br /><br />I was not sure when i first got this sword but after some testing, it rocks.&nbsp; It often happens that it is the last blow that extends the proc, doubling the effectiveness for the next 3 swings.&nbsp; Also, as long as you are fighting someone hard enough to last more than a few hits you score the extra damage of the last hit under the proc which at -2100 armour is damage not to be missed.<br /><br />All in all, i heartily recommend the iron counterweight as an enchantment on the bonereaver's edge.&nbsp; Pally or no Pally, this rocks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Actually, A hunter wouldn't even want this, 2x Dawns edges will do the trick. As For paladins.. they should just stay back and play with their shield or something. For mr. Paladin who was being all pumped about dealing more dmg than everybody: Either the others(behind you in the dps-meter) were total noobs(i.e Hunters specced for beastmastery lol) Or 10 levels below you. <br /><br />Warriors don't need this either.. What the hell is a warrior thinking about if he uses a 2 hander? Deathwish? Now.. Both warriors and paladins could use it in PvP, it's the only application this sword has. But since paladins really just run around with their shield up or healing themselves(looking totally retarded btw)...that's why I think It should go to a Warrior, a paladin can pick up some little 2 handed twig or something..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A hunter will never get a high DPS 2 handed weapon on any raid I go to. Epic Guns and Bows were made for hunters because that's what they do the most of. Who is going to benefit more from a 75 dps weapon, a MS warrior or a hunter (melee hunter? he wouldn't be in MC if he was a melee hunter).<br /><br />This is strictly paladin/warrior weapon only as is the axe. Hunters simply will never be allowed to loot these... and the guilds who are even ABLE to beat her aren't going to have retarded loot systems that allow hunters to get these weapons. Don't kid yourself, you hunters will never wield this weapon.<br /><br />Edited, Fri May 13 19:04:16 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sry Guys, but if you say that paladins do more damage than warriors then you got no clue how damage dealing works. We dropped Ragnaros twice with our guild and two allies and i can say that warriors even beat hunters and mages in the damage done rankings. Full def specc is useless for tanking. Even the maintank can tank Ragnaros with 31 points in arms. And i should know, cause i maintanked him.<br />We have a DKP system, but we decide first which items benefits what class the most. That means a DPS Warrior that does not tank in Molten Core, besides Majordomo, can use such a weapon in PvE and in PvP. A Paladin is a pure buff and healing character in raids and in PvP to be honest, he is not the damage dealing powerhouse that a warrior can be. A paladin won't die, that's right, but he won't kill anybody either. <br />To the people that say this would be a hunter weapon too, sry guys, but that is wrong. Hunters are a mostly ranged dps class, ok they need also a good melee weapon but this weapon does not benefit their ranged dps. They just should use something that gives boni to agi, crit or sth like that.<br />For example Typhoon, good hunter weapon imho.</div>

ANY paladin could beat the hell out of a warrior, but if you had a fight between a warrior and a paladin who could not heal, the warrior would whoop his ass. Warriors are defense, if your a warrior, use a god damn shield, and if you dont want to, make a damn paladin... 10-20 actual dps isnt worth losing 2100+ armor for a warrior at all... as for the concept of this weapon going to a HUNTER... now thats just retarded.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was just looking around to see what the best weapons were, and what I could realistically aim for...<br /><br />I suppose I made the mistake of reading these posts, because its very depressing. I pretty much soloed my way up to 54, and at 53 I was still able to solo things 4 levels higher then myself. I never picked a paladin so that at the end game when(if) I ever went on raids I would just be this extra healer... If you want an extra healer, ask for one, don't impose your beliefs of how a paladin should be played on someone else.<br /><br />Because if you ask me to come along on a raid to be an extra healer/buffer, I'm going to tell you no, even if *gasp* that means I give up chances at great equipment.<br /><br />It really gets to me when everyone but pallys says that a paladin should be played a certain way.<br /><br />Just my thoughts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This thing is an absolute beast. The dps on it is extremely high and unprocced hits much harder than UTB unprocced or even drake talon cleaver. Procced, it hits harder than even ashkandi or GM sword depending on armor calss. Unlike UTB though, this thing procs like its going out of style and frequently stacks all 3 times.<br /><br />Took about 12 rag kills for us to see one drop though...warriors with anything less than kalimdor's or ashkandi should seriously consider it.. it's just amazing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would hope that any guild good enough to receive this sword would not still be *rolling* on items. DKP ftw</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ivalice, paladin from Magtheridon in my Guild got this when we downed Rag. We are a raiding guild and we sure as &amp;*!@ dont use DKP. We prefer systems where people who were in the raid all have a chance (unless A. this is their first time or B. they won something already). To say paladins deserve this over warriors is stupid. Just cause a warrior may be able to do more damage doesnt mean they need good two hander more. A paladins only source of dmg is a 2 hander just like warriors so they both have equal claim to it. That crit + SoC crit = 2500 dmg easy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is probably the strongest weapon in the game, period. I'll have to get this for my warrior. Screw Arcanite Reaper, this one looks so much cooler too.<br /><br />I think any of the three classes can roll on it, however warriors get seniority. If the warrior has/doesn't want it, then it goes to a paladin, and if they don't want/ have it, it goes to the hunter. If they don't want it/ have it (not very likely), then it should go to whoever wants a little extra cash/ disenchanters.<br /><br />Warriors: Obvious, damage dealers.<br />Paladins: They're weak as it is. They need this sword to try and match up to warriors in damage. Can't just sit there and tank, gets boring.<br />Hunters: Screw stats. For all we know, this might possibly be stronger than any bow in the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bobbins:<br />I played a 60 paladin in MC raids for quite a while, and honestly the only roll they are needed in is buffing and dispelling, along with backup healing to conserve the priest or druid's mana. The miniscule and completely random dps a paladin deals is not nessessary at all. Paladins make the alliance's MC runs much easier as they have 2 dispelling classes, a vital role that can't be overlooked. You are going to have to conform to the rolls an MC raid needs you to fill. <br /><br />Otherwise, in normal end game raids (everything but MC/Onxyia) you usually are able to hit stuff and occasionally heal if the main healer is oom or killed (which shouldn't happen). Buffing is a major part of the paladin's role, so you are going to have to get used to that. <br /><br />Edited, Mon Jul 11 22:33:22 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A few things:<br />&quot;in a period of say 1 minute you will have proc'd with seal of command 3 times 4-5 at the very most. &quot; - Hephaestion.<br /><br />A warrior can hit MS every 6 seconds. Most true MS warriors try to come as close to this as possible. This will often be 8-9 extra attacks/minute, as opposed to 3-5. Also, MS does extra damage, so against everyone but plate-wearers, it would probably be better than Seal of Command.<br /><br />Also, with sword specialization, we have a 6% chance of an extra attack whenever we attack. This would be around 1 extra attack per minute with this sword.<br /><br />Also, SOMEONE said pallies 2-hit people. Yeah, sure, a paly can 2-hit a cloth-wearer with crap greens of the owl, critting and proccing seal of command both hits. I'm amazed.<br /><br />And on the crit thing, a good end-game PvP warrior will probably have about 30% crit with this thing.<br /><br />In response to Sterben's whole post:<br /><br />&quot;Warriors are tanks. They should be using sword/shield. Paladins are offtanks and melee assist. Thus, they need 2h to be able to add damage. I'm not sure how people miss the logic of this, but they do.&quot;<br /><br />If you're off-tanking, you should still use sword/shield, and this is from MC. You know that paladins don't melee in MC, right?<br /><br />&quot;In addition, Paladins have a talent to increase +crit. Warriors do not. Thus, weapons with +crit to them seem more appropriate for a class that can spec that, at least logically speaking.&quot;<br /><br />This has already been shown stupid.<br /><br />&quot;Anyone who thinks this is a warrior only weapon and not viable for Paladins is a fool, and makes me glad I group with players who know how to play this game.&quot;<br /><br />This isn't a point at all.<br /><br />I'm alliance, but I'm glad the horde got this sword, because if a paladin took this...I would be so pissed. And so would all of the warriors in his raid group.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Apr 30 00:00:00 2005</div>

Get off with the idea that (Protection) warriors are the only ones wanted in raids THEY ARENT dmg dealing 2hd warriors are just as good sure we do take a beating i know that but we're better off doing much more dmg then taking it... since you're too damn gimped to actually hold agro rigth... i mean in any other game ived ever played paladins are meant to well you know... tank sure warriors can tank too but were not meant to be the main ones...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Blackand Doomsaw or Obsidian Edged Sword would better suit a pally. No..this weapon definately belongs in the hands of a Warrior. Maybe a hunter with the combination of a Striker's Mark, but sense the introduction of Lok'dolar staff of the Ancient Keepers that transforms into Rok'lodar Longbow of the Ancient Keepers, I see no need for this weapon to be in the hands of anything other than a warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On PvE I don't see any reason why a hunter would roll on this. In high lvl instances hunters just don't melee unless the main tank can't do the job right. Sure the maintank needs to use a shield+1h, but offtanks could use this.<br /><br />On PvP, there's no reason a hunter shouldn't roll on this equally with warriors. After all, with the honor system and zerging, hunters are very very often in melee situations. Even though they might get out of melee, this sword is definently a lifesaver if a rogue gets crippling poison on you or whatever.<br /><br />So PvP, free roll for those who can use it.</div>

Fact is things change from lvl 39 to 60. <br /><br />1)He mightve had crap gear<br /><br />2)you cant wear plate at lvl 39, which is why the fight was fast;Paladins are great in the lower levels but later your damage will not increase at around 45-50. While the warriors continues to grow with new skills.<br /><br />3)It is a totally different game once you are 60 compared to only 39. <br /><br />4)<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Warrior">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Warrior</a> please read both and compare <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Paladin">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Paladin</a>. As you can see Warriors have tons of combat abilities that add to their damage. Use your common sense.<br /><br />5) Paladin end game gear is focuses on Sta/Int while Warrior end game gear is Sta/Str.<br /><br />To say a Paladin does more damage than a warrior is just insane. Ask anyone who is level 60 and they will tell you the same thing I have just said.<br /><br />6)Re-roll now if you think you will ever outdamage a warrior.<br /><br />And that is your explanation Ganthorzar, have a nice day :)<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jun 1 15:26:21 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been at lvl 60 for over a month now, doing regular raids (BRS/BRD/Scholo/Strat/DM, etc.) nothing over 15 yet. Finished my MC attunement recently, but I like to PvP, simply because one of the more important things in RPG's for me is building up a character, and seeing how it stacks up against others'.<br /><br />When I finally get around to doing MC (should be a couple more months I'm guessing), you're damn right I'd be trying my best to get this weapon whenever it drops. I don't mind buffing and healing in raids, and once I want a break from pvp, I'll go holy and do the raid thing. But in the end, running places like MC to me is a means to an end - going to pvp and kicking ass! And this sword would rip in pvp with retribution build. If I crit for 900+ with Peacemaker on Judgement of Command, this sword should take it to almost 1500! (the crits in my current build are over 20% already, and i'm shooting for about 25% eventually)<br /><br />My point is - don't count out pallies, because we all have different reasons to play!<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jan 5 18:59:32 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As it is, paladins must rely purely on luck to do any sort of damage whatsoever (using Seal of Command). This weapon would work great for a paladin, as SoC damage is based purely on weapon damage, thus the higher the better. No doubt it is very deadly in the hands of a warrior though, as I have seen, Bizter (60 Tauren Warrior from Shadows of the Horde) completely destroys people with this weapon. As for hunters, stats are probably better, and I agree with the hunter that posted before that Typhoon is a much better hunter sword. <br /><br />My guild has just started to get serious about MC, so I hope I can pick up one of these in a few months (or however long it takes us to get to Rag), wouldn't mind an Obsidian Edged Blade either .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't understand why some of you are so spiteful towards paladins and their divine shield. If it wasn't for that shield, then GG on corpse run in many circumstances for you idiots. The pally wouldn't live to rez you. <br /><br />And for the Horde, you have freakin shamans. If anything needs a nerf, it's them, so shut up about paladins.<br /><br />I prefer this sword go to a paladin than a warrior. Why? warriors aren't meant for DPS end game, your just there for people to beat up on you and have a decent enough weapon to get and maintain agro. Leave this to a melee class who is dps based - paladin.<br /><br />Hunters are RANGED attackers. Their purpose is not to melee. For the idiot who said they are in line for this, think again. This sword is wasted on them.<br /><br />Pally first, warrior second. No others should roll for it.<br /><br />And no, I don't play a paladin, contrary to my username. Mages FTW.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon would substantially increase the DPS of a warrior<br /><br />because, as you know, warrior dps is exponential which is the reason the reaper is so hated by cloth wearers..<br /><br />Now you have a weapon that has 60 more base damage, thats 145 or so extra damage per crit (impale), more deep wounds damage and MS would be THAT much better.. but heres the clincher..<br /><br />Warrior DPS is exponential for a number of reasons but one of the most important, yet unnoticed is that rage = special moves and base damage = rage, so doing this much more base damage will generated that much more rage that warriors will never have a time in which they dont have 30 rage for Mortal Strike, this means they can then suppliment the rage on even MORE damaging moves increasing the total DPS again..<br /><br />This weapon is wasted in the hands of a hunter, completely, melee hunters are so $%^&amp; its not funny..<br /><br />and a paladin? dont make me laugh! the benefit it gives a paladin is a near linear increase in DPS, the proc is the only thing that makes it exponential and then it is not a major improvement<br /><br />sure both hunter and paladin can make use of it, but it gains the MOST benefit in the hands of a warrior, period<br /><br />Edit additions:<br /><br />Using a mod that parses group damage given and taken then filtered and calculated..<br /><br />Warrior DPS in Molton Core is ALWAYS substantial, depending on the boss or the trash mob, warrior dps is more often than not on top of the ladder, beating even mages and rogues..<br /><br />Now this is because you only need to be in defensive with a sword/shield if you are the one tanking the mob, all the others can DPS it up and easily enough stance switch and take agro if the MT dies or loses the mob<br /><br />Edited, Sun May 1 20:33:25 2005</div>

In fact, a +5% crit talent on all melee is at the very first tier of the Fury tree.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First of all, Pimpside is right. The only way a Pally deals damage is by the sword, so warriors and pally's should have equel chance. Everything else said about it is off topic.<br /><br />Secondly, why do many people keep saying that warriors deal so much more damage than pally's? I've tested it and it's simply not true. I deal as much or more damage than a warrior.<br /><br />I tested it vs a warrior who was only one level below me. We both had the same weapon. I (as a pally) didn't shield/heal myself during the fight. Just one on one chopping to see who would die first. <br /><br />First time the warrior won, second time i won. Noticable was that the warrior dodged a huge amount of my blows, many more than i did his, this was both times we duelled. Since i lost and won, it simply means that not only can a pally keep up damage wise, a good pally can deal more damage per blow than a warrior. And in this respect, a pally would need the sword more since he doesn't hit as often!<br /><br />Think i speak crap? Come to Dreanor realm with a same level warrior, and after a few duels you will know that i tell truth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a 60 Paladin, and do PvP... yes paladins do deal good amounts of damage, that is... if they proc alot on SoC. However Fury/Arms Warriors out DPS Paladins any day (with ease). It is true that we are cleansebots/healbots/wannabe warriors (retribution spec). However, undead mobs are a different story. As far as pvp goes, my paladin uses +6% dodge items, I believe +45 Defense adding items, and Barbarous Blade along with 2 other +% crit items, in duels, Paladins can not be kite (if the paladin knows what he's doing) so please do not try, and I myself can get fury/arms spec warriors down to 20% hp sometimes 10% without heals or &quot;I win button.&quot;<br /><br />Paladins are great &quot;Duelers&quot; but when you are raiding Horde toons, they will aim for your ass... and once you use that &quot;I win button&quot; you are done for the next 5 mins, don't bother trying to get a heal off with 6 horde toons on ya.<br /><br />I played d2lod alot so I am used to the not healing aspect in dueling. I only heal against rogues &gt;&lt;...<br /><br />Against Cloth, paladins SoC proc/Crit can be up to 2k with my equip. Against Plate lucky to see 1200.<br /><br />PS. Paladins are Uber Priestesses, no HoT (heals over time) but my mana pool with AI and Kings = 6k :) I can heal for long time, me love you long time. And we can take damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK I've has enough of this complete Kiddie on Dad's credit card bull#$%^.<br /><br />This is a Paladin/Warrior weapon. And hell if everyone on the raid had one, the next man down would be a hunter, but lets be fair guys in the time it takes you to swing this puppy....against a melee class, you should already be dead!<br /><br />On Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying it says Paladin/Warrior only. Thats because Paladins are a melee, gear dependant class, most of which due to some run ins with the nerf bat and poor alternative talents, are 2 hand using retribution specced. And that means we use Seal of Command.<br /><br />Seal of Command is a buff that adds a damage dealing proc to your weapon. This damage is dealt as holy (so ignores armor) but can be dodged, missed like a melee attack, it cannot be parried or blocked, because it ignores armor.<br /><br />The damage dealt by the seal is determined by weapon damage, the faster and weaker hitting the weapon, the weaker the holy damage dealt. Not only this but seal of command procs on a per minute basis, not 2/5 swings, but in a period of say 1 minute you will have proc'd with seal of command 3 times 4-5 at the very most.<br /><br />SO! the slower the weapon speed the better because:<br /><br />a) The Holy damage will be more (with a weapon like this you are gonna see about an added damage of 500-600)<br /><br />b)This is a slow weapon, therefore with a per minute based proc there is greater likely hood of a proc on each swing, rather than loads of weak swings and an occasional weak proc. We have Strong powerful swings with massive dmg dealing procs that will go off probably every 1/3 swings with this thing.<br /><br />Paladins are a gear dependant class like any warrior, to stop them from rolling on a weapon like this is utter lunacy. However my argument is entirely vouched upon the fact I am retribution specced, and proof of this on the roll can be given by Blessing of Kings/Seal of command/Vengeance. How good this would be in the hands of holy/prot spec I cannot say.<br /><br />There is no legitimate reason other than the fact Warriors are being angry, bitter, jealous little kids who simply want to try and eliminate more competition on the rolls.<br /><br />Any Warrior wanna see if they can take me down?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is more a Paladin sword than a Warriors.<br /><br />Why? <br /><br />Warriors are tanks. They should be using sword/shield. Paladins are offtanks and melee assist. Thus, they need 2h to be able to add damage. I'm not sure how people miss the logic of this, but they do.<br /><br />In addition, Paladins have a talent to increase +crit. Warriors do not. Thus, weapons with +crit to them seem more appropriate for a class that can spec that, at least logically speaking.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks this is a warrior only weapon and not viable for Paladins is a fool, and makes me glad I group with players who know how to play this game.<br /><br />*edit* This is in response to those who seem to think this is Warrior only. Personally, I would have no problem with a warrior rolling on it as a 2h warrior is as viable in PvP as a 2h Paladin. Warrior only though? Nope.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 28 16:26:09 2005</div>

I can tell you that this weapon is a bit of a waste on a hunter. Its application is in PVP where it could do some nasty damage for a paladin who can keep himself alive with heals or nastier for a warrior who is less survivable.<br /><br />Bottom line is whoever has the most points will win this there will never be a roll and there will be a master looter.

Rolling is for open raid retards, raiding guilds have loot systems. so all your &quot;you shouldn't roll!&quot; sh*t belongs in UBRS/scholomance/strat.<br /><br />Warriors use a SHIELD on serious raids. Warriors TANK, they don't dps on raids, and our warriors are all defensive specced, since arms/fury are USELESS on a raid of this scale. if we wanted more physical dps we would have recruited more rogues.<br /><br />No one -needs- a two handed weapon. it doesn't help warriors tank better, doesn't help hunters shoot arrows/bullets better and it doesn't help paladins heal/cleanse better. all two handers are no more than toys.

You have rogues and warrior go full damage.<br />We've killed ragnaros 4 times, and we get him in Execute range before his hadds spawn thanx to rogues and warrior DPS.<br /><br />And you seriously think paladins have as good use for this sword as a warrior damage-wise?<br /><br />pfft<br /><br />edit: With more warriors/rogs instead of like mages and hunters, we would down him before adds come..

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How about you people stop this rediculous discussion? At the point in the game where a Paladin would be able to get this weapon, he'd very likely already be toting around a Lavadredger, or holding out for one.<br /><br />And warriors simply have more damage potential than Paladins. This doesn't mean Paladins can't do a lot of damage or never outdamage a warrior, it just means that if all factors are equal, a warrior will simply do more damage. This is just the way the game is balanced.<br /><br />All other things aside, I have this weapon and must say that I'm pretty disappointed by the looks of it. I don't understand why so many items in MC have unique graphics, but of all things considered exactly the most precious drops in the instance, Ragnaros' own loot, does not. It's kinda stupid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>okay, here is the thing:<br /><br />I agree completely, paladins should have an equal chance on rolling for it, but the thing is if it is a guild only run and i decide who gets it i sure as hell would want a warrior with this over a pala with it. palas might be able to dish out some good damge with it, but a warrior with it would be plain out SICK. it would be lights out if this thing proccs sword specc of a MS crit and the extra attack crits. thats GG already for close to any class, cuz it would bring just about any class into execute range.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Pallies are a melee class. There is no other way for us to do sufficient damage to be worth a damn, so I say pallies and warriors should be able to roll on this together.<br /><br />1v1 we need all the DPS we can get without sacrificing alot of HP and MP. Hell I'd like to have 5k HP and MP with 20% crit all the time, but it probably won't happen.<br /><br />I roll with 4k HP and MP in my normal gear, and this weapon would make my life a bit easier, especially with +22 int or crusader =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To finish this stupid debate on who can use the sword and who cant...U ALL CAN, i dont see the &quot;warrior only&quot; or &quot;hunter only&quot; all i do suggest is that if a warrior, paladin and hunter are in same group use 2h swords then they both roll.<br /><br />Case closed no more whines, complains or biting eachothers throats out :-)<br /><br />smile and be happy its a damn good sword</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You guys are mental. Lets talk pvp value.<br /><br />There are 3 times of classes: Melee, ranged, and casters.<br /><br />Rogues, Paladins and Warriors are all melee classes<br />Hunters are ranged<br />Everything else is a caster class (first and foremost, including druids and shamans)<br /><br />So the only argument should be between the Rogue, Warrior and Paladin. Guess what. Rogues don't use 2 hands so I guess we're down to 2. And now we need to consider....wait...NOTHING. Thats it. In pvp there's only 1 way for a melee class to kill. By using a melee weapon. Paladins don't heal or cleanse people to death. They use their 2h. That's why there's a talent tree dedicated to damage. Same goes for warriors. Regardless of group or solo pvp, those aren't factors when distributing loot in raids. It goes to the person who deserves it (within the classes that need it)<br /><br />The whole debate of who gets the &quot;most&quot; use out of a item is redundant and has been for a while. Obviously you need to exclude people from rolling based on the class types I listed above (ranged, melee, caster) when considering weapons, but aside from that if we lived by the &quot;most use&quot; rules you'd only see warriors and priests getting all the loot. Hybrids would get nothing. Don't feel bad about being retards tho. It's not your fault.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Give it to us ^^ there is a reason the updates on pally gear makes you guys healbots heh.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sorry to say this but, from what I'm hearing most of you sound like you've grinded to 60.<br /><br />please note *most*<br /><br />Hunters<br /><br />I'm appreciating all the comments about this NOT being a hunter weapon. Please hunters, stay away from the mobs where you belong. Way way way back. If you find yourself in melee so much that you see this as a necessary weapon then use your traps / skills better and learn to keep your distance. Stick with the Typhoon.<br /><br />Pally's<br /><br />What the %^&amp;* is going on with the pally posts? Damage dealers? Warriors tanking?<br /><br />I can't be bothered to find the quote but someone here said something along the lines of &quot;Paladins wont outdamage a warrior but they will live longer.&quot; This is so very true, the only thing pally's should be doing in parties is buffing and bailing people out when the healer drops dead.<br /><br />Now i dont know how your raid parties work but my ideal 5man party for each is 2 Warriors, 1 mage/rogue, priest and a druid/pally.<br /><br />now i'm going to stress this point with caps,<br /><br />AN ENTIRE RAID PARTY ONLY NEEDS 4/5 TANKS.<br /><br />That is 4/5 warriors who enjoy the pressure of tanking and keeping aggro. The rest of the warriors simply beat into everything else, and can often outdamage mages / hunters in raids, and still have the back up skills such as mocking blow<br /> and challenging shout.<br /><br />My opinion is this is a warrior weapon, it has massive top end damage, meaning our skills benefit greatly. the 300 armour reduction is pretty crap in my opnion but the +% crit is nice.<br /><br />Aint saying thats the gospel, but when you look at it logically, warriors benefit from it more than any pally.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Jesus %^&amp;* I am so glad I rolled Horde, do you paladins even realise how much a pain in the ass to the warriors who got you to this drop are? Even if a Paladin can outdamage a warrior in full wrath...wrath is a god damn broken tanking set. Give the warrior some of the real gear he needs, and he will dwarf the paladin stupid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I say if the class can use it, then let them roll on it. If you can train in 2h swords, then you should be able to have a fair chance at it. It's not clearly specced for any one class; it's not like it has healing specifics or anything so quit getting your undies in a bind. Sick damage is sick damage, and if I see it then I'm rolling on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Warriors use axes for the crit chance...the DPS bonus is not worth losing the 5% crit chance that warriors love so much.</div>

I don't get to go to many raids/instances, and so I have pretty crappy gear ect. Give me this weapon and I will probably be 20% better at dishing out damage in pvp. <br /><br />cya</div>

First off you dont need to be thinking about how good a PVP player you will become you need to think of how this would benefit the raid as a whole.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LOL what ever. First off 5% crit chance can be made up for in other areas if so desired. I dont use axes. I dont want to use axes and when Im using my 2h sword its generally in PVP or When the extra armor isnt a factor. Killing something 4 times faster evens out the amount of damage i might take with out that extra armor because they arent alive long enough to make a difference. <br />Like i posted before not everyone uses 2h Axe.. for whatever reason.<br />I love my Sword Spec. I can just imagine the damage this would do when i get the lovely 4 strikes in one swing because my sword spec proced and then proced again from the first proc just in time to land the next normal swing. This is my pvp wet dream. Take your cookie cutter 2h Axe build and have fun if thats what you want and like.<br />Ill stick to owning with my 2h sword spec.<br />Besides Swords are so much sexier than axes heh. Especially this one. Would love to see it with crusader on it or icy weapon. If you do get this enchanted send me a pic .. it will replace the picture above that ive already got set to my background reminding me what my level 60 weapon goals are every time i look at my pc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>and another intresting fact i would like to point out is the fact that this not the best 2h weapon in the game. It is, however, So Far. The fact remains that if you have a weaponsmith buddy who has the plans for a Sulfron Hammer, than you need to get him/her to make you one to bank until you can defeat Ragnaros in a raid your self in hopes of him dropping an Eye of Sulfron, and most likely roll on and win this item cuz it is not very well known yet of what it does. IF you do win Eye of Sulfron you can then combine it with the Sulfron Hammer to make....... dunt dunna duh....RAGNAROS'S HAMMER....that's right the very hammer he has killed an assload of people with....so let your thoughts dwell on that!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>saying this weapon would only benefit 1 class is absurd, anyone who says that is a complete idiot...obviously both palis and warriors depend on 2h melee in pvp, and the higher the damage the higher our soc crits could go.

Obviously any warrior will say oh well we have talents that would go well with that sword...true<br />so do palis...the only people who should not be allowed to roll on this are hunters, Typhoon is 10x better for you then this is, and i wouldnt even let a hunter roll on that if i was leading the raid group because you dont need damage that high for your wingclips here and there...leave the high damage high dps weapons to those who rely on melee and go to DireMaul to get the 1% crit 2h.</div>

And so would all of the warriors in his raid group.&quot; is a freaking idiot. pallys and warriors can get uqual use out of this weapon. i spec'd retribution on my pally, and i do plenty of damage. the fact that most pallys dont experience this damage is due to them specing holy or protection. to say that you would be pissed about a pally rolling on this is retarded.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To all of you who say &quot;This should go to &lt;insert class&gt;!&quot;:<br /><br />STFU<br /><br />Anyone who can wield this weapon is entitled to it.<br /><br />There will never be rolling unless you are a 2h wielding class and your DKP is tied with another 2h wielding class, and even then it would most likely be assigned by the raid leader based on your seniority or how vital you are to the raid/guild or how much of an upgrade it is or how much ass you kiss or whatever. Someone saying &quot;This belongs to a &lt;insert class&gt; only, and no other class should ever get it because &lt;insert random stupid excuse&gt;!&quot; will never see this weapon so long as that attitude stays the same, because obviously they have no idea how guilds who are able to do this work.<br /><br />Paladin? Warrior? Hunter? Who cares. Whoever has the DKP gets it, but it should never go to a class that can't use 2h's because, well, that's just stupid, and I hope that would <b>never</b> be a problem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>@Ganthorazar<br />Uhm you're saying you can kill elite creatures that are 2-3 lvl above you, so aren't you Level 60 yet?<br /><br />If so please be quiet, cause you know nothing about endgame content. A Paladin is not able to deal as much damage as a warrior. That's an undeniable fact.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I wonder what this disenchants into :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm so glad I'm Horde. I don't have to worry about some Pally with his DPS insecurity wanting this thing.<br /><br />The ONLY way a Hunter in my guild would be allowed to get this is if every Warrior already had one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A palandin don't even come close to warrior damage :P palas suxx they should not be allowed to get epic items at all :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunters should be shot and pallys are nothing more than an priest on steroids and coke, thus this is warrior 110%</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got this from the guilds first Ragnaros kill. I have to say that this sword definitely OWNS! I often pull off 1500-2000 MS crits and 3000-4000 Execute crits with this bad boy. Has to be in the top 5 2-H weapons in the game, so I am very happy to have this. UTB doesn't come close to this PVP killer!<br /><br />Edited, Sun Apr 23 21:38:55 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there is better 2hand weaps for pally/hunt than this one...<br /><br />I (paladin) would choose utb if i had the choice, since +300STR = phat dmgs without considering the SoC (wich can crit too, totalizing nice dmgs)<br /><br />and for warriors sayin':<br /><br />look paladins, i crit executes for 2-3k! omg i'm so good you're so weak ! you weakadin !<br /><br />I respond:<br /><br />get lost i crit for 2k and it ain't executes, just normal crits with SoC...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First off when it comes to execute. you do not do more damage with a 2h wepon than u do with a 1h weapon when it comes to execute. highest crit execute 4045 with my 1h brutality blade. <br /><br />Now with Ret speced pallys. In MC when i start to get bored of the trash mobs and im not listening to whats going on....just killing the mobs. I sit there and do white damage.....just sitting there not using any special attacks and a ret pally can bearly pass me or just slightly glide 1 or 2 places ahead of me. Im not all epiced out so im not more equiped than everyone around me. I have brutality blade ( nice weapon) and the av dagger (revered average weapon), if i try i can easily stay up in the 1-3 highest dps up with the mages and the rogues. there is just no way a ret pally can do ALOT more than a dps warrior unless much better equiped than everyone els. If i see a warrior in our raid with this sword, he should be at the top of the list. the entire time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Raijinmeister</b></h3>I got this beast for my arms warrior last WED 1/8/2020. <br /><br />The proc is up pretty often making this weapon way above its current iLvl. The enemies are basically naked in front of you and I'm usually breaking the 800+dps even without a ton of buff in lvl 60 dungeons. <br /><br />Can't wait to raid and see how my dps will be.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gulanga</b></h3>This sword is very famous, despite the lackluster look it has.<br /><br />The reason it is so talked about is the special proc it has that lets the user ignore 700 armor on enemies, stacking up to 3 times. <br />Armor removal is one of the biggest DPS increases in Classic, which is why things like <a href="/classic/spell=11597/sunder-armor">Sunder Armor</a> are so important.<br /><br />To put this sword into perspective, bosses in BWL have around 3750 armor. With 3 stacks you can remove 2100 of that with the sword alone.<br />And it procs a lot. I've had situations where I've charged a target, have it proc on the first autoswing and then proc again a fraction of a second later when I use <a href="/classic/spell=23890/bloodthirst">Bloodthirst</a>, so that I start a fight with 2 stacks up. From people that have tested it, it seems to have a procrate of 2 procs per minute from autoattacks only. This will of course mean that it is much higher once you start using abilities as well.<br /><br />The problem is that using raid debuffs you can already remove up to 3395 armor from the boss, with 5x <a href="/classic/spell=11597/sunder-armor">Sunder Armor</a>, <a href="/classic/spell=9907/faerie-fire">Faerie Fire</a> and <a href="/classic/spell=11717/curse-of-recklessness">Curse of Recklessness</a>, which only leaves 355 on the target (which can be removed by a single stack of the swords proc). On private servers the bosses had much more armor making BRE legendary, that is where its reputation stems from. In Classic it is still great, just not as insane as rumors from private servers made it out to be.<br /><br />Important to note: the proc is a buff for the user (<a href="/classic/spell=21153/bonereavers-edge">Bonereaver's Edge</a>) and not a debuff on the target.<br /><br />It is a very popular weapon for PvP but also great for 2h Fury in PvE, the only downside is that it is very rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>123user</b></h3>The proc rate of this thing has been very well documented by some enthusiastic data collectors in the Classic WoW community. Since no one has shared the details here, I thought I'd just go ahead and share what they've found.<br /><br /><b>Recorded hits:</b> 168494<br /><b>Procs:</b> 19340<br /><b>Proc chance:</b> 11.5%<br /><b>PPM:</b> 2<br /><b>Other:</b> <a href="/classic/spell=21153/bonereavers-edge">Bonereaver's Edge</a> is classed as a <i>beneficial curse</i> which means it can't be dispelled or purged in PvP; buff does not retain when weapon is unequipped; proc used to be a debuff on target rather than a buff for wielder; proc used to last 60 seconds<br /><b>Patch notes:</b> <i>Patch 3.0.2 (14-Oct-2008):</i> The proc effect is now a buff on the wielder rather than a debuff on the target.; <i>Patch 1.7.0 (13-Sep-2005):</i> The duration of the Bonereaver's Edge weapon debuff has been lowered, but the frequency of the effect has been raised.<br /><br />Please do note, that this information may be slightly off, since it may have been gathered prior to a discovery about stackable debuff procs made in the Fight Club discord.<br /><div class="quote-box">Oh hey everyone there's some more serious data revelations from FC, Garcia found out that both wowlogs and procscience have been failing to track refreshes of stackable debuffs and confirmed this for Badge of the Swarmguard, Bashguuder, Rivenspike, Annihilator, and Bonereaver's Edge<br />He then tested Bashguuder again with a special filter and found good data on Bashguuder showing 2PPM, but all of those aforementioned data will be probably incorrect</div></div>
