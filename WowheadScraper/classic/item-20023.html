<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is easily solo-able at level 50.&nbsp; just watch the giants.&nbsp; The hippogryphs are useless to kill, unless it is simply clearing the way.&nbsp; it's the Chimera (Mistwing Ravager) with the shared spawn.&nbsp; kill any of these as well as oozes.&nbsp; btw, pickpocketing ftw.&nbsp; picked a stack of 2 frags and also got one in regular loot, off the same ooze.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just pickpocketed the last 2 fragments in one go! there were acctually 2 fragments when i pickpocketed, so be sure to pickpocket them.. might get luckky like me!<br /><br />althought it did take me a good fricking hour or two to finish it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A good idea is to pickpocket and then kill. Sometimes they both pickpocket and drop it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lol .. i got 2 fragments from pickpicketing 1 :) .. happend 2 times .. was over pretty quick for me :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is easy, I'll give you the co-ordinates of the Forest Ooze Spawn points. They respawn at roughly 5 minute intervals and they are not affected by other mob counts so don't feel pressure to kill stuff because other mobs are unrelated to the Forest Ooze Spawn event.<br />68,25<br />68,30<br />71,29<br />70,31<br />74,29<br />**These co-ordinates are created using CTRAID. I don't know if other programs use the same co-ordinates.<br /><br />Enjoy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went around the two hills about 5 times, only found 3 oozes, then I followed the above post, followed the co-ordinates, and found 5 of them in less than 3 min</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Encoded Fragments, Rogue quest for lvl 50.<br /><br />The Forest Oozes is not easy to find because they are not so many... I ran around for like 1 hour or more to find all Fragments....<br />But if you pick-pocket them and then kill then you have a small chance of getting 2 Fragments on 1 mob. I ran around so mouch that I know the place off by heart now :P.<br />When I pickpecketed a Ooze I got 2 Fragments and when I killed it I got one more Fragment ;D.You will find the Forest Oozes in North-East Azshara.<br />You can run around for hours without finishing the quest..&nbsp; &nbsp; If you need help to get up to ArchMage Xylem you just kill some Hippogryph's until you get some Undammaged Feather's and find his little tower on the map (pink little housroof on map) in the mountains. When you see it, try find a Blood Elf that stands near the mountain from where you can see his roof. There is like a sign in the ground there. If there is , you are right. Talk to him. He will teleport you to another portal. Don't talk to upper-portal-guy. Keep going straight ahead and follow the road until you come to his tower. Not far. When talked to him, go back to the portal you came from and talk to the upper-portal-guy and you will be teleported down. I'm not good at writing this stuff, but I hope you get it :P.<br /><br />Never give up and watch out for Elite-Giants! <br />Good Luck!<br /><br />From Punkd on Ahn'Qiraj.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well that was nice, i pickpocketed the ooze and i got one and i killed it and got another. So, it really is possible to do that. AWSOME!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well.. I read all of your comments thoroughly. I stocked up on MD and pissed myself empty. Considered myself prepared for the hour or two of improving the ass groove in my chair. Gotta say.. part of me was disappointed.<br /><br />Quest accepted -&gt; Quest turned in: 23 minutes.<br /><br />Three times in a row, I pickpocketed 2 fragments at the same time. &quot;You receive loot:x2.&quot; Only killed 6 oozes.<br /><br />Best of luck to y'all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Curse you Blizzard! Took me over two hours to finish this &amp;*!@! Worst quest ever! I need teraphy now...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have been here searching for 45min and only found 2 and pickpocketed both and killed both none!makeing me MAD!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>these are hard to get took me forever<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />lvl 51 orc rogue/eitrigg<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jun 28th 2006 at 1:02pm EDT by Blakblt</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To make this quest easier.<br /><br />You can pickpocket the oozes for 1-2+ Fragments, as well as getting some more on the kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MorsGladius</b></h3>So it looks like Wowhead is a bit off. Almost every animal in the area with the Forest Ooze drops these Encoded fragments. The <a href="/classic/npc=8761/mosshoof-courser">Mosshoof Courser</a> and the <a href="/classic/npc=8763/mistwing-rogue">Mistwing Rogue</a> do and they are all over the closer area at 37, 70. Not sure if the <a href="/classic/npc=8764/mistwing-ravager">Mistwing Ravager</a> does because I just stayed to the near spot.<br />I got the quest done in less than 15 minutes by looting the other animals. They had the majority of the drops</div>
