Equip that and you can find him. He's located in one of the houses on Caer Darrow.<br /><br />There's also been rumors of priests being able to see this vendor after equipping an Eye of Divinity, however I don't have a priest so I can't confirm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I looked by the map on here and couldn't find it. Is it inside Scholomance?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Cooldown is one day, Essences of Air are worth the 15G.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dunno, something around there is reasonable. Transmuting one thing takes away from an Alchemist's ability to Transmute another later, for up to a day or two.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm and herb/alch ... all transmutes I've ever done have a 48 hour cooldown.&nbsp; Can do arcanite any time for 4g ... climbing to 5g these days.&nbsp; Seems like transmuting essences should be worth a little more, considering they're tougher to get, and prolly aren't sold as often (just got my first one ... haven't sold that ability yet).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm maxed at herb/alch too, and I've found that all transmutes are now going down in price. I used to be offered 10g for an arcanite bar transmute, and now I have trouble even getting 5g for it. Also, the cooldown for the arcanite transmute is 48 hours, and I'm not sure about the essences transmute. Never done them for anyone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the cooldown for arcanite is 48h but for essence is 24h...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The quest you have to do to see the dead vendor is the Butcher quest where you have to kill the 3 people in scholomance. It can only be done with a 5 man group not a raid.<br /><br />After you hand in the quest you just get something to kill you and go see the vendor, that simple.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wow greedy people, on Llane i see transmutes go for 5g noone crys about it. glad im there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>on blackrock... arcanite bars sell for 25-35g for 1. i sold one the other day for 25g. on AH<br /><br />and alot of the essence's sell for anywhere from 10g-20g+...<br /><br />inflation is a !@#$%</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Man, I wish. I get 2g TOPS for Cured Rugged Hide on Draenor, and thats a 4 day cooldown. I don't even sell it anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On Daggerspine acanite trans is 5g, I sell living-earth for 8g and Ive seen water-air for 12g. The market value should be the major factor of the tranmution prices. If you think the services are too expencive just shop around and if you are the Alch then it is up to you to decide who you want to sell to and as in the real world if you want repeat business then you will price accourdingly.&nbsp; Now that I am happy with the guild that I am in, I dont sell to anyone but my guildies-- so I dont charge just get things in return.<br /><br /> If you really want a good price do like I did and create more ava's and stop complaining about prices and do the work yourself! Then come back to this forum and post your feelings about the work other ppl do and how much you apprieciate thier effort.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Proodmoore had arcanite xmutes going for 2.5 to 3g for a long time.&nbsp; Eventually the alchemists (like myself) just wised up.&nbsp; The diffence in price on the AH for 1 Arcane Crystal + 1 Thorium Bar vs 1 Arcanite Bar was about 6g.&nbsp; So we just started buying the reagents, using our spell, putting the Arcanite bar on the AH, making 6g in return and said scr*w off to people offereing 2.5g.&nbsp; The prices equilibrated within a few weeks and now the xmutes go for about 4g, the same as the difference in price from the AH.&nbsp; Oh well, no more arbitrage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Done the quest, been talking to Magnus Frostwake every day for 2 weeks now but only thing good for me that i could buy is major mana recipe. Any idea of what the problem might be?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a little guide to show you how to buy the recipe's without doing the quests in scholo<br /><br />First go to TM and binder your hearth stone there.<br />Then go to Sen'jin Village and talk to the wich doctor and get the buff that makes you see ghosts.<br />After that immediatly hearth to TM..<br />Follow the river on Mount untell you get to the bridge enter the town and there will be a Blacksmithing house on the Left.<br />Enter in there and buy the recipe's...<br /><br />Also you hafta have the Zalazane quest finish for the witchdoctor to cast on you..<br /><br />This guide was created by <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; HLIOS <br /><br />on the Azgalor Server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;Follow the river on Mount untell you get to the bridge enter the town and there will be a Blacksmithing house on the Left.&quot;<br /><br />Follow the river south? or north?<br />Which town are we talking about?<br /><br />edit: It was north =) and into wpl.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blizzard has fixed this method of gaining the recipe.<br /><br />u cant go to Senjin anymore and hearth to TB.<br /><br />lol, good job i did this a few days ago before 1.9 :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This trick no longer works in patch 1.9</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So, if this doesn't work anymore, what do we do in order to get this recipe now?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After patch 1.9, you do it the way all we good players do: Complete the freaking Scholo quests!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ha, I would be happy to get Air @ 10g.. its running maybe 30g a pop right now..and it won't drop... I hate being an enchanter</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Please note - Transmuting Arcanite activates a global Transmute timer of 2 days, during which you cannot do Water to Air.&nbsp; However, WtA transmute should only cause a 1 day cooldown, and makes more profit per use. <br /><br />Zoah</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tried using elixir of detect undead. didn't work and I was only able to detect the two ghosts infront of the entrance and the artist outside western wall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I would go so far to say that Arcanite Xmute's are becoming out of date compared to other Xmute's. It takes a 2 day timer on your stone, and you can get roughly 4-5g for doing it.<br /><br />On my server Essence of Water sells for about 2-3g and Essence of Air for 10-15g. The profit there is enormous if you consider making a few alts, grinding them to 58-60 using just rested xp, and have them pick up alchemy for this transmute. You could (if you had 4 60's which isn't hard to do) make a potential of, at least on my server (Illidan), 40g a day! That's not bad just doing transmutes, and considering that Essence of Water isn't being sold much anymore while Essence of Air flys off the AH, there is a market for this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks for the WOW economics lesson, but what I need to know is how to find this item. I have looked all over the suggested area and could find nothing in the BlackSmith or any other buildings. Is the vendor a ghost and I just cant see him or what?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>... on my server &gt;.&gt;<br />because essence of water sells for up to 5g and essence of air for as low as 7g sometimes -.-<br />transmute arcanite tip is only 2g usuallly as well</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You have to finish a Questline in Scholomance.
