<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I spent my whole level 21 killing shammans, ogres, enforcers, all level 18 or 19. Believe it or not, the last shamman I dealt with tonight not only got me to 22 (thanks to 245 XP), but also had that marvelous rare item.<br /><br />Just wanted to share... patience is a virtue!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>took me about 10 kills to get it. though it took a while because I was doing it solo. the listed drop rate is so poor because tons of people kill ogres who don't have the quest. when you have the quest it's definitely better than 2%</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It took me about 1 hour and 45 minutes or so, and a lot of kills for this to drop, luckily, there were enough green drops and whatnot to make it somewhat worth my time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>an hour later I has one! lvl 22 mage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got mine on my 41st ogre kill with my lvl 23 mage.<br />Quite tiresome that I had to drink and eat after every fight ..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Solo'd the level 18-19 Shaman mobs at level 19 on my Hunter ( with poor quality gear). Was dicey trying to solo Enforcers and Ogres they usually killed my pet and then it was a 80-20 ( mo'grosh favor) gamble if I could finish them off in melee.<br /><br />8 kills for the crystal to drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lvl 23 hunter, and yeah... I did nothing but murder Mo'grosh for 2 hours and no drops. I guess I'll try again tomorrow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was doing the Mercenaries quest at the same time.<br />Had to go into the caves to find the brutes. Fought my way into the middle of the three caves (26 Mage), killed 3 Brutes, and a couple of Mystics<br />4th brute killed (which completed the Mercenaries quest) also dropped the crystal.<br /><br />Which was nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>90 minutes, lvl 20 and lvl 19 hunter. About 80 kills. No crystal. Crap quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>3rd guy dropped the crystal. dropped off the ogre type mob</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>FINALLY got this to drop after killing them for an hour, killed over 30, got it from an enforcer<br /><br />19 d0rf hunter with bear :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LordMaxen</b></h3>Took me roughly 3 hours straight of farming Mo'grosh ogres to get this. Recommend doing it at a higher level so it's less painful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stopherbm</b></h3>IMPORTANT!<br /><br />When the crystal drops it's shared, so everyone in a party gets one. Which means you can have a party of 5 hunting for the crystal, which is a pretty annoyingly rare drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Greeley</b></h3>OOF! Got home at midnight from work, was 3am by the time I got it to drop. I'm a level 26 holy paladin so killing them wasn't hard but it took a decent amount of time. The quest reward wasn't worth it as I didn't get exp out of the mob kills. at least I got it out of my log.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rawbdawg</b></h3>2024 Anniversary Classic Fresh:<br />Killed about 40+ various ogres before my group got this to drop. Crystal drops for everybody in the party.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shrikearghast</b></h3>Anniversary classic: this can drop from ANY of the ogre variants - not just the 'Ogres' listed. This is good, because all the exterior ogre types share a spawn (so the 'Ogre' ones can be pretty stubbornly rare).<br /><br />So basically: kill any ogre that moves. But if you're solo, expect it to take a while... a very long while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sacksnsuds</b></h3>Guess I never did this back in the day. It is attached to an awkward quest chain, but told myself I would do things I never did before. So last few characters I've done it and it dropped in the first few kills so I assumed the drop rate was pretty high. Last two HC characters, one I gave up on it and the other I'm on ogre number 45 and still no crystal. About to quit the quest again and I'm not sure if that's a bad thing. It's a very &quot;classic&quot; thing. Edit. Went there close to leveling, gained 7 bars into my next level. I leveled to 25 so the 18s were grey. Solely based on the exp gained I killed 83 ogres and I estimate another 30 or so level 18s (mostly shaman since they were so easy). So I said one more and that's it. No drop, hearthed and abandoned the quest. During that I filled my bags twice with drops so made some money. That's twice I've just abandoned it which in hindsight is just a bad mechanic.</div>
