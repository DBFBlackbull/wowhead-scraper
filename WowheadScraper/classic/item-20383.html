one would hope that a raid group going through BWL would make sure its members were trustworthy, so it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nif you do not have the quest *in your quest log* you will not be able to see or loot the head (we've had someone win the roll and then realize they dropped the quest and forgot to get it back : P).\n\nif you're part of a decent raiding group with the gear and experience to be clearing BWL each week, it isn't *that* hard to get the head, even if you're in a group that, like mine, doesn't charge dkp for the head.&nbsp; if you're not part of such a group, you shouldn't be getting it anyway as there are a LOT of steps in the various chains requiring a raid.&nbsp; everyone should find out what sort of stuff is involved in the quest chain before they win the head so that they don't get it and then realize they aren't interested in seeing it through.\n\nonce you get the head and go adventure in AQ 40 and earn your rep, you go to anachronos at the caverns of time, back to the AQ gates to watch a mini-drama and then back to anachronos.&nbsp; from there, he suggests you seek out vael (BWL), azuregos (his spirit in azshara) and eranikus (ST).\n\nwhen you talk to vael, he will challenge you to complete the remainder of BWL and down nef within 5 hours.&nbsp; to complete the quest you loot a red scepter shard from him.&nbsp; again, no matter how many people are on this quest, only one will be able to loot the item.\n\nvisiting the spirit of azuregos (and btw, you must once again be dead to speak with him or even see him) will start another line that sends you back to tanaris.&nbsp; this is the blue scepter shard chain but has some other quest lines that spawn from it.&nbsp; one ends up requiring a drop from trash mobs in MC, another takes you first to winterspring (small group quest) and then requires collecting items from, among other places, ragnaros and onyxia.&nbsp; you'll also end up with a quest that requires a small raid (15-20 people is plenty) in feralas on the isle of dread.&nbsp; the primary part of the line (for the sceptre shard) will eventually require 20 arcanite bars, 10 elementium ore and some other mined gems.&nbsp; after that there's a raid to defeat an underwater boss in azshara.\n\nas for eranikus, you go to him in ST.&nbsp; as i recall, he's green (as in non-hostile) before you start the encounter, but i went to help some lower level guildies who had wiped a couple times and needed help killing him and was still able to do the quest despite him being hostile.&nbsp; what happens is that when someone who has been told to visit him for the quest line enters the room, malfurion spawns in the center of the room and after some dialogue will give a quest.&nbsp; after some running around you have to go collect a drop from the trash mobs in each of the four green dragon spawn points (again, takes a small raid) and then do a raid in moonglade.\n\nthat's about as far as i've gotten\/figured out, i'm sure there's more for me to discover once i finish it all :P.\n\nbottom line, after getting the head, you'll have to do multiple MC runs, down ragnaros and ony, clear BWL in <5 hours, fight multiple outdoor bosses that are specific to this quest line and do some other quests requiring a small raid group.&nbsp; every item drop required can only be looted by one person and chances are you're going to be waiting in line. without a steady, capable raiding group willing to help their memebers, you are not going to be doing this quest chain... getting the broodlord's head is only the beginning :P.","date":"2006-07-17T07:55:01-05:00","rating":25,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"lisara","importedSubject":"various explanations of things"},{"commentv2":1,"number":14,"id":2675409,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"So ultimately what is the reward for completing this lengthy quest line?","date":"2006-07-17T07:55:01-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"you can kill the 60 elite bugs in silithus for brood rep.&nbsp;

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is the head that is required to open the gates of AQ. It is required along with lots of turn in quests that the whole server must partisipate in to access the AQ 40man instance. It is dropped off the boss in BWL of the same name. However, if the turnins are not completed on any given server after a certain ammount of time, the gates will open anyway after a time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;&quot;Be careful!&nbsp; Master looter does not work for this item.&nbsp; We found out the hard way when the master looter found it deposited in his own inventory when he tried to master loot it to the designated recipient.&nbsp; Whether this is working as intended or &quot;working as intended&quot; it is pretty lame :/.&nbsp; We're hoping a GM can sort it out for us. &quot;&quot;<br /><br />I don't know why bliz does this on a real important item but hand out all the loots first and when someone wins this head via roll turn looting to Free For All and then they can loot it. Works pritty much the same with other items that cannot be rolled for like the Santa Hats. <br /><br />&quot;&quot;It's not one per server or one per faction...&quot;&quot;<br />Duh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Our master looter tried to pass this to me and ended up with it in his bags... BE CAREFUL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>YES, it does have a 100% droprate. Before anyone asks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you come back in one week and kill him again, do you get another head?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes you get another head if you come back the next week and kill him again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The head is bugged MLing does not always work. We had it happen the other night. Call a GM they should eb able to reward the head to who ever you wanted it to go to (ML) that is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did you guys not learn with the blood of the black dragon champion?&nbsp; You cannot Master Loot Quest Items.&nbsp; However anyone with the quest can loot the head even if its on Master Loot.&nbsp; Just make sure no guildie goes Whoops! and Ninjas the head. : P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So, after the gates are opened, what do you need to do to get the weapon rewards?<br /><br />Turn in carapace fragments?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>killed him and i won the head on my 1st try since my guild didnt use DKP it was just a fact pof people who had the quest to roll and i rolled 98 so in my bag it went and&nbsp; u get a respectful amount of rep handing it in oh and i won DS greaves to go with it :D (im obviuously a hunter for all u smartass noobs out there )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got mine yesterday evening by rolling a 76 against... um many many others and i just have to pay 30 dkp for it ;)<br /><br />Pssst... was my second travel to him with my new raidgroup. :D Now - who wants to gimme 10 Elementiumore oO</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>are there any rewards to get with the head? I won it yesterday, but I only get a weird thingie..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>first of all, the drop rate is not showing as 100% (the true drop rate so long as at least one single person in the raid has the quest) because the quest for the head came out quite a while after BWL was introduced -- obviously the head wasn't put in his drop table until the quest was added to the game.<br /><br />you can NOT ML the head under any circumstances and yes, it can be very easily ninja'd/accidentally looted (which is why a smart raid leader is sure to remind people not to touch the corpse).&nbsp; one would hope that a raid group going through BWL would make sure its members were trustworthy, so it shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />if you do not have the quest *in your quest log* you will not be able to see or loot the head (we've had someone win the roll and then realize they dropped the quest and forgot to get it back : P).<br /><br />if you're part of a decent raiding group with the gear and experience to be clearing BWL each week, it isn't *that* hard to get the head, even if you're in a group that, like mine, doesn't charge dkp for the head.&nbsp; if you're not part of such a group, you shouldn't be getting it anyway as there are a LOT of steps in the various chains requiring a raid.&nbsp; everyone should find out what sort of stuff is involved in the quest chain before they win the head so that they don't get it and then realize they aren't interested in seeing it through.<br /><br />once you get the head and go adventure in AQ 40 and earn your rep, you go to anachronos at the caverns of time, back to the AQ gates to watch a mini-drama and then back to anachronos.&nbsp; from there, he suggests you seek out vael (BWL), azuregos (his spirit in azshara) and eranikus (ST).<br /><br />when you talk to vael, he will challenge you to complete the remainder of BWL and down nef within 5 hours.&nbsp; to complete the quest you loot a red scepter shard from him.&nbsp; again, no matter how many people are on this quest, only one will be able to loot the item.<br /><br />visiting the spirit of azuregos (and btw, you must once again be dead to speak with him or even see him) will start another line that sends you back to tanaris.&nbsp; this is the blue scepter shard chain but has some other quest lines that spawn from it.&nbsp; one ends up requiring a drop from trash mobs in MC, another takes you first to winterspring (small group quest) and then requires collecting items from, among other places, ragnaros and onyxia.&nbsp; you'll also end up with a quest that requires a small raid (15-20 people is plenty) in feralas on the isle of dread.&nbsp; the primary part of the line (for the sceptre shard) will eventually require 20 arcanite bars, 10 elementium ore and some other mined gems.&nbsp; after that there's a raid to defeat an underwater boss in azshara.<br /><br />as for eranikus, you go to him in ST.&nbsp; as i recall, he's green (as in non-hostile) before you start the encounter, but i went to help some lower level guildies who had wiped a couple times and needed help killing him and was still able to do the quest despite him being hostile.&nbsp; what happens is that when someone who has been told to visit him for the quest line enters the room, malfurion spawns in the center of the room and after some dialogue will give a quest.&nbsp; after some running around you have to go collect a drop from the trash mobs in each of the four green dragon spawn points (again, takes a small raid) and then do a raid in moonglade.<br /><br />that's about as far as i've gotten/figured out, i'm sure there's more for me to discover once i finish it all :P.<br /><br />bottom line, after getting the head, you'll have to do multiple MC runs, down ragnaros and ony, clear BWL in &lt;5 hours, fight multiple outdoor bosses that are specific to this quest line and do some other quests requiring a small raid group.&nbsp; every item drop required can only be looted by one person and chances are you're going to be waiting in line. without a steady, capable raiding group willing to help their memebers, you are not going to be doing this quest chain... getting the broodlord's head is only the beginning :P.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So ultimately what is the reward for completing this lengthy quest line?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Do you need to be an engineer to do this? Does it matter if you are a goblin or gnome engineer?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You take this to Cenarion Stronghold in Silithis. When you get there, Commander Keith will take it from you. He then calls forth his lieutenants; Lance, Hunk, Pidge, and the Princess Allura. A brief cutsequence ensues and they magically combine each of their Mechanical Frostsabers into a mighty robotic construct, with the Broodlords head sliding into place at the top. This Universal Defender then summons forth a mighty Blazing Sword and slices through the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj. After this occurs, all guilds will have access to the new 40-man instance.<br /><br />Pretty cool, eh?<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jan 4 15:32:20 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does this seriously say in the item description that only one may loot his head?</div>

Head of the Broodlord Lashlayer is the objective of the <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/scepter-of-the-shifting-sands-scarab-lord-legendary-mount">Scepter of the Shifting Sands</a> quest <a href="/classic/quest=8288/only-one-may-rise">Only One May Rise</a>. As this is a raid quest, you will need a full raid team. The boss only drops ONE head, meaning only one player in your group can get this every week.</noscript>
