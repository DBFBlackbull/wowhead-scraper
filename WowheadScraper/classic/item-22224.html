<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This was one of the components for the banner of provocation, a few quests after baron.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Used in &quot;The Instigator's Enchantment&quot; which requires the following<br /><br />1 - Jeering Spectre's Essence<br />4 - Dark Rune<br />8 - Large Brilliant Shard<br /><br />Drops in DM West, got it 2 after killing about 15 undead.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went into DM west last night to help a guildie on his lock mount quest and I walked out with 3 of these things.&nbsp; I think everyone got at least one, so they seem to be dropping fairly frequently.&nbsp; For us at least...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As stated these are for the .5 tier quests as part of the line that leads up to the boots/pants/shoulders rewards. You have to have 1 of these essences along with the 8 large brilliants and 4 dark runes. <br /><br />They drop from the ghosts in DM west. The drop rate is quite high. You do not need the quest in order to obtain the item and everyone in the group is able to loot. <br /><br />You also need only one of these for the quest so there's no reason to hang on to any extras. They are not tradeable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got two of these but what classes needs them .. Do we all?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>is there any reason that this wouldnt drop while solo?&nbsp; i've killed about 50 of the ghosts and havent seen one yet :(&nbsp; would have been faster to just join a full west run</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yup, same thing as above guy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive done two full DM west runs and the undead havent even dropped one for me or anyone else in my group! WTF? Did blizzard change something?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've done this instance everyday for the past four days and still nothing has dropped. Did blizzard change something with this item or what? People said it used to drop all the time, now nothing. What are people to do when they are upgrading their stuff? I'm hoping the next patch will address this issue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whats the next quest after this? I'm almost there and I'd like to know ahead of time what I'm looking at, so anyone know whats next?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took me about 8-10 kills to get mine, I did it solo in the hall between the tree boss and immothar. Finally dropped off of a lvl 58 Eldereth Phantasm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Second kill, soloed by a lvl 60 rogue..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I killed (solo) around 100 if not more ghosts, before I got mine. Be warned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The devs have clearly stealth nerfed the droprates on this, I've killed a ton of ghosts in DM west both with and without the quest and have had no luck at all even seeing one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The droprate on Jeering Spectre's Essence has not been stealth nerfed.&nbsp; What has changed is that players now have to be on the quest in order to see/loot them.&nbsp; My guild is routinely looting them in the first few Eldreth kills.<br /><br />The experienced low drop rate may be a result of killing the wrong ghosts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I soloed here til I got 1, 60 shadow priest.&nbsp; Took forever though :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Friend rogue and me (rogue) did the hallway behind the treant, dropped in our fifth reset.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wow lucky bastards... yall donrt even know what they are and have like 7... im on this quest and cannot get one to drop...<br />but ive been soloing the first two Spectre's and then reseting...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here is my guide to solo farm this object:<br />(in reply of former post, only explained)<br /><br />As of the new patch, this will only drop when you have the quest, and i can asure you they drop from eldreth spectres, the invisible mobs that aggro when you walk over them.<br /><br />When you enter DM west, follow the path around the Garden, the same path that the big trees walk. following it clockwise will give you more chances to make the opposit side. Once there take one of the two gates next to the one that leads you to the big-boss-tree, you should stay on the balcony and wait there. There are two patrols of one eldreth spectre each. Kill them.<br /><br />If they don't drop, go out reset and try again (you can only enter 5 instances in an hour)<br /><br />This is soloable by any decent-geared lvl 60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>followed the solo guide above as a 60 shadow priest.&nbsp; it worked great. second ghost dropped it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Same results as priest ... 2nd kill dropped for me ... ice mage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just did this solo as a 60druid, was easy enough to get in even without stealth, i killed the 2 that patrol up top near the tree boss. then moved down to open the door near the tree boss, in there i stood a within visual range of the first ghost i could see and just waited for the 3 invisable patrols to come at me one by one. it droped off the phantasm to i think btw</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Previous post is accurate, there are two single pats on the balcony.&nbsp; However, after killing the two pats and resetting 6 times, I am thinking that you have to be grouped to get a drop.&nbsp; It certainly did not drop very easily for me.<br /><br />60 Holy Priest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is how i did, enter through DM west, walked clockwise to other side, got the 2 up there that patrols, then went down to the passage to immol'thar and pulled them 1 by 1 out to the room where tree boss is.<br /><br />There is 3 purple stealthed ones here that patrols, this is why you should pull them out.<br />Aswell as 2 non stealthed ones.<br /><br />This way you get 7 ghosts each reset, which should increase your chance to get the thing you're looking for. Got mine in reset #3, so at like 15th mob or so, might be good / bad luck on drop rate though, but i doubt it should take much more than 3-5 resets<br /><br />Hope this helps some<br /><br />Sonaks 60 Mage<br />Sonaksen 60 Warrior<br />Twisting Nether - Horde</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the drop rate is massviely increased near the magister</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I followed the solo instructions above and got mine from the 6th kill or so (1 reset only). Pretty straight forward kill both in bear and catform really, with a heal if needed :)<br /><br />I'm not sure if it currently drops without the quest, I had it anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How are you guys soloing this?&nbsp; EVERY time I try and solo, I get so close to killing one of those damn ghosts, then another or sometimes 2 more will just jump right in.&nbsp; I can do one by itself fine, but not 2 or 3.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got the jar on my 3rd kill i failed the 2 ghost so i had 2 reset and after i killed the 1st ghost again..i got it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Found two off about 9 spectres/apparitions in DM West. They do not stack and are soulbound. I have no new quests since the 1.10 patch and don't know what they're for</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This item is used for your tier .5 set. you need this with 4 dark rune and 8 large brilliant shard to continue your quest for the boots, pants, and shoulder upgrade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Had to kill Ghosts solo for about 4 hrs as a feral. Then I finally got it (Nov.23.06)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got one off the 5th Eldreth Spectre. soloed it. just stealthed through as a rogue and waited for them to spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I also got some tonight. Does anyone know how many are needed for the upgrade quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Don´t know when exactly they changed it, but the time they implemented it you could loot these anytime. Cleared whole DM West yesterday w/o the quest and we didn´t get a single one, afterwards I picked up the quest, returned and got it dropped off the first ghost I killed. Hope that info helps :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've finished the whole questline, but I ran DM West and found I was able to still pick up these items (So was the rest of the party). I went to the Library to see if it was a repeatable hand-in for like rep or something, and nada.<br /><br />Anyone got any idea why we can all still pick these up :S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>r4z0r84</b></h3>got it in dm W solo whilst waiting for the invisible spectres to walk down the corridoor just above the treant boss. got it in 5 kills, there's just one on each side then reset. you can get there by just waiting around for the smaller tree mobs to move out of the way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PinchySkree</b></h3>60 priest, full holy in tier 2.<br /><br />Went up the stairs, unlocked the door, avoided the patrols of elementals, followed the wall left to the tunnel.<br /><br />As each single invisible patrol of an Eldreth Spectre attacked me, I ran it around the large grey block to make sure it was on it's own and took it down.<br /><br />There's 5 possible kills in there each time, took me 24.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ketsui</b></h3>Better way to solo this step is actually if you have DM north Key, drop into library, run into backdoor hallway of ghosts behind tree boss, at least 6 spawns all can be done solo, just be wary they patrol so try to get singles, see invis helps here</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arccai</b></h3>Currently up at 43 kills, still nothing.<br />Bad luck eh?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wraiyth</b></h3><b>Season of Discovery</b><br /><br />If you want to solo this step, enter through DM North, head down the ramp when the single patrolling Ogre moves away and take immediate left down to the door to library (you will need the Crescent Key).<br /><br />Head into the library and onto the upper level via the ramp ahead and to the left from where you enter.<br /><br />Follow the path in the back left corner up that ramp, which leads to the room containing Immol'thar's prison.<br /><br />Turn immediately left and hug the wall, following it around a small distance to reach the path between Immol'thar and the DM West tree boss.<br /><br />This pathway contains some individual ghost spawns which can drop the quest item. A few of these ghosts are invisible and appear to patrol the entire length of the corridor so (especially if you don't have detect invis) be super careful - it's possible for you to be fighting a single ghost at the entrance and be ambushed by 3 invisible ones if their patrol syncs up like it did for me on one attempt. Some of them put a curse on you that does 2k+ dmg after 1min, and a less dangerous curse which reduces str and stam for 2min.<br /><br />If no luck on your drop head out via the same way you came in, reset and repeat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PlusTech</b></h3>September 2024 - Season of Discovery<br /><br />Easily solo'd on a blue-geared mage. With arcane spec, you can just beacon yourself and facetank the mobs with the self healing. Also use Ice Armor just for the 25% attack speed slow.<br /><br />Walk past all the trees at the beginning, go to the right of the first boss and walk along the wall, open the door with the DM E key, and there's a few ghosts in the tunnel. Two of them are stealthed and often patrol right on top of each other, so you'll need to do a bit of kiting with cone of cold / frost nova, but it's still easy enough.<br /><br />There's also one more stealthed ghost that patrols around the ledge surrounding the tree boss.</div>
