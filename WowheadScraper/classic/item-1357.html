<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mashby</b></h3>This is a rare drop for a quest that involves a treasure hunt. Murloc's north of the Gold Coast Quary will drop this at around 4%. The numbers on Wowhead are skewed due to the fact that there are a lot of Murlocs south of Gold Coast Quary that DON'T drop this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok. blizz has officially LOST their minds. .4% drop? who is EVER gonna get this quest?&nbsp; Statistically, you would get this map once out of every 250 drops!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Any can tell what the reward is, is it worth it ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The experience is worth it, as well as the items you get at the very end. they are nothing great, but once you get the map, you just have to run to about 3 Locations . Each location gives you 575 exp .one is on the beach by the boat and anchor, next is by a Chimney beside the road that the Defias Messegner walks on, next is a windmill up near the mines but its by the shoreline. Then lastly you turn west from the Windmill and go out into the water to a small island for the treasure.<br />The final treasure is captain Sanders&nbsp; shirt ( no stats ) Capt sanders sash ( some stats) , Booty bag ( 8 slot bag) and 1 silver bar , plus 1150 exp at completion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Final reward is: <br />1 silver bar <br />an 8 slot bag called Captain Sander's booty bag <br />Captain Sander's shirt <br />Captain Sander's sash (16ac 2stam 2 spirit)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stop whining.<br /><br />The quest starts with this dropped item, Captain Sander's Treasure map.<br /><br />The first clue, Captain Sander's Foot Locker is at 25,47.<br /><br />The second clue, A Battered Barrel is at 40,47.<br /><br />The third clue, Captain Sander's Jug is at 40,17.<br /><br />The final clue, Captain Sander's Chest is at 26,16.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The shirt is worth it, it just looks cool, kind of a &quot;muscle-shirt&quot; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I finished the quest but is there another quest including using the 3 leftover mappieces? In that case where, who to talk to and what level need i be? There is no sell price on the pieces, as a regular quest item.<br />Thankful for a reply...Bothersome to have 3 &quot;useless&quot; bagslots occupied.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So according to drowsykitten's post, apparently all the items are located at four different corners of a big square.&nbsp; Strange...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tidehunters do NOT have a 20% drop rate. Look at the number of kills next to the percentage. When the number of kills is much lower than it should be it means the data is somehow invalid.<br /><br />The droprate is low, but that's because you should do &quot;The Coast Isn't Clear&quot;, you have to kill 30 murlocs for that quest, and thus you'll more likely kill something like 50. Then you are much more likely to get the drop.<br /><br />Blizzard hasn't lost their mind, they just make some quest more rare to get so the game is fun for your second and third characters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i think this quest must be relatively new. the drop rate percentages are so low because the map didnt drop before the quest was added, and all those extra kills throw off the percentage a lot.<br />both times i did it, it didnt take me long to find. i think passe's percentages are for one drop, not an average of all drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this shouldn't be a level 16 quest when u have to kill 4 or 5 guys at a time who are level 15-17.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got mine in 10 minutes, party mate got his 20 minutes later. Wrapped up the whole shebang in about 40 minutes total.<br /><br />Good stuff for a &lt;20 level toon!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Remeber thott only reports on items drops etc for people using an interface that updates Thott.<br /><br />I got this drop on 2 diff chars the same day and killed less than 10 murlocks each time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is the quest available for Horde?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you can do it as a horde if you want to go all the way to westfall coast, i did it after my friend and i were doing the coast isn't clear. he got it, we finished the coast isn't clear and his treasure map. a day later i decided i want to do the quest to and the murlocs dropped it within 5 or 10 kills, the drop is much easier than you think</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's all a matter of luck, some people will get them quick some won't. It's the same princible as a collection quest that isn't a 100% drop, I have had party mates complete those quests before I get my first item. As far as the bugged Murloc, it probably isn't a data bug, the level 15 tidehunter is probably just a rarer spawn also, if you see one kill it quickly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A murloc oracle dropped the map as soon as i was done w &quot;The coast isn't clear&quot; quest.. very lucky! The murloc was standing next to the shipwreck near the lighthouse..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I played through the entire quest to the final treasure chest and it would not open.&nbsp; I got all the rest of it but no final prize, or experience points but the quest is gone out of my log as being completed.&nbsp; I hope no-one else has this problem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, did you guys get left with the 3 pieces of parchment? Do I need to keep these or can I get rid of them?<br /><br />Kita</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's increasingly obvious to me that it doesn't matter where you are along the coastline, nor what type of murloc you kill, you still have the same low probability of getting this map.&nbsp; I acquired 3 pearls, over 30 clam meat, 4 greens and tons of vendor trash, 2 dozen murloc eyes, and 20 slimy murloc skins by the time I finally got the map off of a low level netter on the &quot;easy&quot; end of the coastline.&nbsp; Have empty bags and lots of patience if you want to look for this thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to the really easy Murlocs at the top after awhile, and all the ghost captain's quests were done, took maybe 20-40 murlocs to drop one, found Slark twice, and Brak (Think that's his name.) once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1.&nbsp; Go to the beach in Westfall (it's on the West!).<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Kill the Murlocs that are easy for your level.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; They drop a Treasure Map.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Find the first clue, a Locker at these coords:&nbsp; 25, 47.<br /><br />Hint:&nbsp; The Murlocs at the northern end of the beach tend to have this Map...</div>
