<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this quest today, and this is what I found:<br /><br />1. Scroll called cortello's riddle found in one of the three pirate ships in stranglethorn vale. Inside, on the second level down, behind some barrels in a back room.<br /><br />2. Next scroll is found in the water benieth the bridge at the first crossroads in swamp of sorrows.<br /><br />3. This scroll is found in a cave in southwestern dustwallow marsh.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>scroll can be found at 31, 66</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Contrary to an earlier post, this is a 14-slot bag.&nbsp; It is *not* a 16-slot bag.<br /><br />Still a nice item, but don't want anyone going under false pretenses.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The scroll to be be found beaneath the bridge is not just 'under water', it's also not visible. Looking towards the east, the scroll can be found between the /left/ pair of columns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The scroll for me was under the left side of the bridge(looking south) took me awhile to find it.<br />I wish i was a gnome...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>took me about 30 secs to find the scroll under the birdge, easiest quest ever...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>MrTicklesbourgh is absolutly correct. Stand under the bridge between the 2nd and 3rd support beams. Face east looking at the 3rd support beam, between the two brown wooden looking things on the 3rd beam. Back up so your back is up against the 2nd support beam while looking at the 3rd support beam. Now look down and scroll your mouse at about 10 o'clock. You should find it. I got 3600 xp out of just doing this. Next part is going to Dustwallow Marsh on the other big island. Good luck...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just confirmation on 23,48 in swamp of sorrows, and first crossroad.&nbsp; once you get onto the bridge you go off to the right side.&nbsp; Facing northwest (if you're a night elf, kneel, even though you still won't be able to see it) it's in the middle of second and third columns, and middle lengthwise of the columns (while you're facing northwest)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You have to have Terrain Highlights turned on in your video settings to see through the surface of water. If you don't have Terrain Highlights on it is impossible to SEE the scroll, you will have to mouse over the water on the east part of the bridge until you find it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was bored translated the German message:<br /><br />One finds the second scroll to the Quest &quot;Cortello's mystery&quot; at the northwest bridge in the sumps of the misery. The scroll is to be seen bad, but if one drives slowly with the pointer of mouse under the bridge between the column, the action wheel betrays the discovery site</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The scroll in Stranglethorn can be found in random places on the ships. I found mine between a cannon and the wall on the 2nd floor of the Eastern of the two ships right next to each other.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just done this, and surprised noone has given the co-ords of the falls before. <br /><br />Find the falls at 80,46.<br />Dive down and you'll find a small black crate in the water beneath the falls.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I coulnt find it after 5 min and was thinking of some ideas and this was how i found it......

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just finished the Bloodsail Bucs quest in a party of two and found the scroll on all three ships but in the same place on each of the ships.&nbsp; It was on a chair in the Captians room each time.<br /><br />From the posts, it looks like it can spawn anywhere on the three ships, but it was currious that it spawned in the exact same place for our party on all three ships.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Cortello's Riddle is <b>Unique</b> and you can only have one. However it is <b>NOT Bind on Pickup</b>. so you can get a friend or one of your higher level characters to get it for you. Plus they can be sold.<br /><br />The same Cortello's Riddle is on each of the 3 ships, with a few random points it can spawn in each ship. Normally in the captain's chamber (back of the ship, 2nd level) Grab it when you are doing Bloodsail Buccaneers for the captains and fleet admiral. (Also the &quot;Snuff&quot; quest.) If you have to go back to town, mail the riddle to an alt so you can pick up another.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b> Cortello's Riddle</b><br /><br />As you head towards stonard there is a bridge just after the first t jnction. hidden in the watter is a soggy scroll... part II</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i found the second scroll at dustwallow marsh at 31.66. A bunch of lvl 40 raptors out front. i just ran in there hit my intimidating shout, feared them off picked up scroll, died, and rezzed at GY.&nbsp; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK...third part. It was at 80.46. Hinterlands is mid to high lvl 40's so if you are not (like I am) just run straight for river and swin down strean to waterfall. Most mobs didnt follow me very long so when i aggro'ed i just kept runnig. To sum up, i got total 12300 XP and a 14 slot bag for 1hour's work. Hope this helps. Enjoy :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Oh yea, if you cant hearth (like me...lol) go south and you will see a white stone block. thats leads up, when you getto the archway go right, not through it (like me).&nbsp; there might be a rogue coyote there so be on guard....the rest is just run like hell...&nbsp; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't know why people are talking about doing this quest at level 38, or anywhere near that.&nbsp; You could do any quest at level 10 if you've got an army of level 50's with ya, but who cares?&nbsp; Why even bother mentioning your personal level? You're not doing the quest.&nbsp; Your friends are doing it for you at that point.&nbsp; Unless you happen to have the ability to go into stealth, this quest is going to be pretty tough to do unless you're in the 40's.&nbsp; There are lots of level 45's on the ships, so even trying to find the beginning of the quest is a pain in the ass unless you can handle them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the riddle on the 3rd floor of the 3rd ship...go down the 2nd set of stairs and it was right there next to some barrels.&nbsp; On my alt I found the riddle on the 2nd floor of the 2nd ship...so it spawns just about anywhere, it's a little scroll.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found the first scroll in Swamp of Sorrows, and then it says something about a cave in Dustwallow. I accept it, and when I get there though, the quest isn't in my quest log. I went back to the first scroll, and there was nothing there, so what do I do now?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went in with 2 other guys, and each of us had to pick up a separate scroll in different places.&nbsp; As it turned out, we found one on each ship, and we had to clear one ship twice to get one for each of us.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this quest at level 57. I had found it helping a friend on the ships. I followed the cords above and found all were in the right area. I am on my way to find the pack now.<br /><br />Found the pack and also received 4900 exp. So maybe if you do it at a lower level you will get more exp. Very good quest. Enjoyed doing it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Could you plz tell me where the 2nd part is without cords? any general area?<br />Maybe what name of the area it is?</div>
