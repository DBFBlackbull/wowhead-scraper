<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well, it's now jan2, and these silly things still do not work for me.<br /><br />yes, i am waiting for the 10 second arming cycle. when pulling a mob over it, they do quite a bit of sparking and smoking, but zero damage. this is evidenced by not only my combat log, but the L8 boar that i tested it on, which should have instantly incinerated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I belive I've tested this enough times to know how they work.&nbsp; They are quite useful sometimes and totally useless other times.&nbsp; First you lay it and it says it will be armed in 10 seconds.&nbsp; About 20-25 seconds later it actually is armed because I've seen enemies walk over it after it says its armed and it does nothing.<br /><br />If it too much time elapses after laying it, it will either fail or blow nothing up or something.&nbsp; Because of this, when using in battle grounds, only use when you know someone will be there kinda soon.&nbsp; Because of this its a little hard to use properly in WSG.&nbsp; I plant one in AB when someone says the node im gaurding has a group incoming.<br /><br />There was one time this actually saved a AB node.&nbsp; I was fighting a rogue vs rogue battle solo defending the node.&nbsp; I almost killed him and he vanished.&nbsp; I laid the mine at the flag and stealthed.&nbsp; He was higher lvl so I knew he would probably find me before I find him.&nbsp; Sure enough I get sapped by him but hes only at less than 1/3 life.&nbsp; He starts trying to get the flag and BOOM he dies and the flag is safe :)&nbsp; Use them creativly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can a hunter use this and his traps?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>are you implying this is a &quot;hunter&quot; weapon?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is there a casting time on this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Prior to 1.11, one of the greatest things about these land mines was they had a separate cooldown timer from your other explosives, so I could set a landmine then toss some dynamite in a kind of one-two punch.&nbsp; With the release of 1.11, they all share the same cooldown timer now so I can only use one or the other at a time now.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />They are still incredibly useful when implemented properly though.&nbsp; You can take those swarms of scorpids in Uldaman down to 1/3 health in one blast with one of these, to be easily finished off by your aoe spell of choice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If youre a rogue this can be so fun ya know.<br />Just get a bunch of landmines and go to a noob zone.<br />Put some goblin land mines on a important road, go stealth, and watch.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Try planting them in WSG Graveyard's. It's good times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can i get some help i have the recipe and learned it but theland mine wont apear in engineering is it cuz im gnomeish? or what?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this isn't a goblin engineering item, so you shouldn't have any problem, whether you're gnomish or goblin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is good for hunters in PVP .&nbsp; Set your trap frost trap and when you see enemy approch place a mine next to it.&nbsp; The mine arms, they stop moving fast and bam there hurt bad</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>think of this like a hunter trap. takes 10 sec to arm and then evaporates after 1 minute if not tripped - but unlike a hunter trap, you can drop in during melee. Can only set one at a time, and cold-down timer does NOT start until after it goes off or evaporates. ALSO - it is on same timer as a dragonling - i.e. cant use dragon while mine is out, and the one minute cooldown blocks the dragon use a well (found this out fighting final boss in uldaman)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>these things never seem to go off in the BG when I place them. They are armed, enemy walks over them 10 seconds after they complete arming... nothing happens. Ever. 10 later and not a single explosion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In warsong gulch you can place these near the flags. If every person in the raid placed one of these at the flag, anyone who tried to capture it would be hit with around 3940-5060 instant damage.<br /><br />Highly unlikely, but it would still be helpful even if there were only a couple engineers with these in the BG.<br /><br />Or worse, this tactic in a 40-man raid on a pull. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where do u learn this explosive</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is this actually any good? What would you use it for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stinkyfinger</b></h3>You can start getting these at level 20, which I suspect is probably the best use for them.Tried one of these buggers in Wetlands while on a murloc killing quest. Set one out, waited or timer, grabbed-up about ten murlocks and took them to the mine and BOOM! None died, but they all were low enough on health to scatter.<br /><br />Kind of expensive way to quest, but it reeeeeeally puts some fun back into leveling a tank.</div>
