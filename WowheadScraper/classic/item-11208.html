<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What is heavy damage?&nbsp; Is it the 265 Attack Power from potion?&nbsp; It's a little vague and if people don't know, they don't buy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Mine droped from flower in un'goro crater.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know how many procs per minute this enchant is based on?<br /><br />assumably it'll be either 2 (like crusader), or 4.5 (like lifesteal and fiery)<br /><br />Considering putting this on my spare weapons for karazhan, and also, general outlands with the large amount of demons to be found in the new content.<br /><br />With this in mind, its more than possible this enchant could start to turn a profit, with so many people farming demons for fel armaments and marks of sargeas to sell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had this enchant put on my 2h axe, and for some reason i didnt get any glow at all...<br /><br />About 20 levels earlier, i put it on a 1h sword and got a glow that looked like firey.<br /><br />Is it just a glitch that mine isnt glowing, or is there some rule about it's glow for 2h axes, or Burning Crusade items?<br /><br />Oh, and BTW person above me:&nbsp; NO it does not help ranged attacks at all.&nbsp; Though if i generate too much agro on a monster and they get in melee range and get a proc, then it would help me get agro back on my pet&nbsp; while i get out of range.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Proc for Demonslaying is this:<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13907/smite-demon">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13907/smite-demon</a><br /><br />75-125 holy damage and a stun for several seconds.<br /><br />Tried it on dual wield daggers in Netherstorm on the demon camps there and it wasn't too impressive. Proc's at least once a fight but the stun time is quite long maybe 4 seconds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>read above<br /><br />&quot;Recent prices&quot;<br /><br />;o</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped mining after I got to 300 Eng and started enchanting, got this farming the elite giants in Ferelas. Been selling them 2x for 60 hunters on their epic bow/staff quest. The extra &quot;heavy&quot; damage is ~100 damage, but the stun is really nice for dual wielding vs. demons. 2 second stun procing every 10 seconds really drops the incoming damage fighting demons.</div>

It procs so much, it isn't even fair to the mobs. Definitely a must have for outland, it makes solo grinding a snap! The 5 sec stun REALLY cuts back on your downtime. It's awesome!</div>
