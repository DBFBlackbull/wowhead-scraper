I beleive that the speed is the main advantage of this thing, it has some important pluses and almost no drawbacks.\n1.Concerning that famous \"fast weapon gimps the abilites\". It USED to be so, but has been fixed long ago. Now the abilities like aimed shot, multishot are \"normalized\" - i.e. generally speaking now their power is counted based on the weapon DPS, not on its one-shot damage. Tested myself. No difference in the abilities power compared to the old 2.60 weap., in fact they've become a bit stronger since the DPS of the boomstick is better. ;)\n2. Scope. In any way this thing MUST be used scoped. Since the scope just adds +X damage to EVERY SHOT - the scope on the PCB is TWICE more DPS effective than on a \"generic\" speed 3.0 weapon. \n3. Pet. In the marksman talent tree there is a nice ability \"go for the throat\", which generates 50 Focus to your pet each time you crit. With 1.5 speed autoshot (not abilities) weapon crits are weaker than with a 3.0 speed one, but they happen TWICE more often \"per minute\" since you make twice more shots over time. So - with the PCB the ability generates twice more focus to your pet - that makes a pleasant boost to your pet's DPS and its ability to hold aggro. (It'd been just AWESOME with a wind serpent before its lightning breath was nerfed :( )\n4. Aggro. \"The less damage per shot - the less agro\" and \"the more crits - the more focus for the pet Growl\" things combined give much more comfortable and aggro-free PVE. ;)\n5. PVP. Read the posts above about casting interrupts. I think here there is a drawback too - for example against self-healers: a massive crit from a slow weapon can sometimes one-shoot a priest before he realises it's time to heal ;). Even this though can be done with PCB - just use Aimed Shot on this priest ;) PCB almost can't do ONE massive AUTOSHOT crit, but this does NOT affect your DPS, just the way you deal it.&nbsp; \n6. Ammo. If you at 40+ can't afford as many slugs as you need - forget it, this gun is not for you. If you somehow got it - just sell it on the AH, you need money more than anything ;)\n\nAnd of course, +14 agi looks nice stacked with all other hunter's +agi things.","date":"2007-03-07T09:38:00-06:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Valentino6","importedSubject":"Concerning the speed..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":27,"id":2684080,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Was running the Sunken Temple as my Warrior in a PuG.

This shot greatly increases a hunter's DPS since this shot doesn't cost lots of mana, has no cooldown and therefore can be spammed between each autoshot. But steady shot has 1.5 sec casting time.

Unfortunately i had not downloaded (or even known about) the wowhead client until after this weapon dropped for me, so i suppose you are going to have to take my word for it.\n\nAnyways, this weapon dropped for me today on Thunderfury US-PVP server in [zone=47] as a level 45 warlock questing. It dropped from [npc=2926]. I had killed maybe about 30 or so of the [npc=2926] for the quest [quest=7828]. Which makes me exceptionally lucky, in fact it may be the luckiest i have ever gotten. And needless to say it was exciting. When i saw the purple text i almost had a heart attack.\n\nMind you this is as of 09-20-19 on WoW Classic.\n\nFurther thoughts i have on this weapon are that after Phase 2 releases for WoW Classic and Battlegrounds are released, this guns price will drastically inflate. As i believe that this is the best twink 49 bracket gun in the game. Current price for this i may be able to get 100 gold on Thunderfury US server. Maybe 200 gold if im incredibly patient. But im going to sit on this one and let its price mature a bit. Its a good long term investment.

Very fast speed gives more chance to critical on every shot combined with your spells, very nice gun.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying this for anything over 100g, if that. You'll end up replacing it a few levels later.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Studiy</b></h3>Actually, if you're a rogue, this is an excellent item because of the +14 agility.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9388</b></h3>Faster weapon speed means you crit for less amount but more frequently.<br /><br />For hunters, it is best suited for talent combos like Imp. Aspect of the Hawk, Bestial Discipline, Serpent's Swiftness, and Go for the Throat to maximize pet focus regeneration.<br /><br />However, as other posters have pointed out, fast ranged weapons deplete your ammunition *extremely* fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>33173</b></h3>Fast attack speed weapons like this are great for BM hunters, but MM hunters should defer for a slower weapon. BM builds with iAotH, Serpent's Swiftness, GFtT can get good sustained dps in raids/instances on bosses, and good spell interuption against casters in PvP. Pop Rapid Fire, which increases the chancce Quick Shots procs. iAotH has a 10% chance to proc Quick Shots, so that's 1 proc every 10 shots. With a fast enough weapon and other attack speed gear such as listed above, you can get your attack speed below 1.0, meaning that Quick Shots will proc continuously during sustained autoshots against bosses. Additionally, scopes which apply +dmg per shot really make a difference since you're firing so many more shots, and you'll also be critting more, even if your crits aren't as big as MM crits. And if you're an Orc, pop Blood Fury for an even better dps boost, or if you're a troll and low on hp, pop Berserking for even fast firing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im a big advocate of<br />Slow = PvP<br />Fast = PvE<br /><br />This holds true pretty much till you reach 60 and is in a good group with a GOOD TANKER.<br />The fact is that there aren't many warriors out there good a tanking, come on we all know who they are, charging instead of rellying on pull, 2handers, relly on dps to hold agro ... that being stated a nuclear crit from a slow weapon will have the mob on you like &lt;insert dirty analogy&gt;, and a hunter dead, tanking, meleeing = crappy dps.<br />In Solo pvp or any kind of PvP for that matter, the hunter is going to be constantly moving/kiting to keep the targets at range and away from the deadzone also one of rare healers that heals in pvp, So you are not looking for consistent damage of a fast weapon, but the burst damage of a slow weapon and Heaven forbid you get one of those muclear crit from multi-shot or even aimed shot, if you got the time, off of a slow weapon like the DHC or Bloodseeker.<br />In an experienced group (Friends, Guild) with a good tanker you should be safe with a slow weapon, but I can't remember the last time that happend with a PuG. (Oh right never)<br />But there is the problem of amno conssumption, this gun runs through amno like a minigun or &lt;insert analogy for fast&gt;.<br /><br />P.S. Feral Druid, although it is unorthadox I find most Feral Druid better tanker since they are actually tanking and not trying to dps.<br /><br />P.P.S. I understand why a rogue would drool over this gun the +14 agi, but you can't ignore the fact that this a good hunter gun. This is not a problem for me my realm generaly go by the &quot;FFA for BoE, and need on BoP&quot;.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So, I broke down if the PCB was better than a dwarven hand cannon or not for straight dps.&nbsp; Since it is a talent I have, I incorporated improved aspect of the hawk into my calculations as well.&nbsp; Sure it eats ammo and doesn't have the burst damage, but let's take a closer look.&nbsp; My calculations are all sprawled out on paper, so I'm not going to give all of the exact specifics, (you can recreate them if you wish)&nbsp; I found that when you incorporate all mods - agi bonus, scope bonus, fire damage, improved aspect of the hawk, the DHC will do about 1dps more than the PCB.&nbsp; That's it, 1 dps.&nbsp; Now, what if something resists fire, a la molton core?&nbsp; Then guess what, the PCB will outdamage the DHC.&nbsp; Now, the PCB sells for 150-250g less than the DHC on my server, so, it was an easy pick.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pros of PCB:<br />Steady reliable damage<br />low aggro<br />interrupts casters like crazy<br />Cheaper than DHC, usable at 43<br /><br />Cons of PCB:<br />Churns through ammo<br />Low burst damage (wussy aimed shots)<br />Not *quite* as much dmg as DHC<br /><br />Pros of DHC:<br />Massive damage, pretty aimed shots<br />doesn't use lots of ammo<br />more damage than PCB<br /><br />Cons of DHC<br />Unreliable damage output<br />Burst damage may pull aggro<br />Expensive<br />Weaker than PCB against fire resistant mobs<br /><br />All in all I'd say the PCB is a better value, though I might prefer the DHC for pvp action.&nbsp; For raids and such I feel that the lower aggro is much more important than the 1dps a DHC has, so I would go with it for instances.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>on my lvl 60 hunter i had the shell launcher shotgun equipped ( <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5220/gnarlpine-fang">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5220/gnarlpine-fang</a> ) and i got this. now i had wanted this for a long time simply because i wanted to know just how fast i could attack with it. and let me tell you it can be fast in the hands of a beast specced hunter. it ended up being a higher damage! by only 0.5 dps (yes i scoped it with the +7 scope) but it was still an upgrade. my hunter has 340 agility by the way. basicially the more damage you can add to this weapon the better it becomes because of its super fast attack speed.<br /><br />however if you went marksmanship in the hunter talents and use aimed shot then you should just sell this weapon in AH. there are alot better weapons for you.<br /><br />for a rogue you probably will never get rid of this gun because of its + 14 agility.<br /><br />also if you are a fury specced warrior you may enjoy this gun for its increased agility.<br /><br />the downside of this gun is that you will end up spending alot more in bullets, especially if you use thorium shells. all in all its a great weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Currently I've come to the conclusion that mana is becoming a big problem for hunters. Our guild is trough BWL and we are currently engaging into AQ bosses and starting naxx bosses.<br /><br />Now, most of you would say:&quot;WTF why you want this lvl 48 gun when you prolly have dragonbreath/ashrethul from BWL?&quot;<br /><br />The answer is quite simple. I equip Black grasp of the destroyer, wich are gloves that regen 8 mana on each of my successfull attacks. I use my basic BWL weapon till I run low/out of mana, then I FD, pop my ZG mana regen items and black grasp + a fast weapon such as this (currently I'm using hurricane for that matter but the basics are the same) .&nbsp; Once I equipped these I pop my rapid fire and let myself autofire for a minute.&nbsp; And guess what, within 2 minutes I've not only regenned most/all of my mana, but I also managed to keep doing a basic steady dps all along.<br /><br />some of you would say:&quot; why don't you FD and drink?&quot;<br />the answer to this is also simple. FD drink will regen mana a lot faster, ofcourse, but FD can fail, while the gun/bow can be replaced in combat, and more and more bosses have AOE effects and stuff like that wich prevent drinking for more than 5 seconds.<br /><br />I won't disagree with the fact that this gun is also prime for other classes that love agility, but it's an epic world drop, and therefor just go to those who are either the luckiest, or those that can afford /buy it the first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Concerning the speed of this weapon. I beleive that the speed is the main advantage of this thing, it has some important pluses and almost no drawbacks.<br />1.Concerning that famous &quot;fast weapon gimps the abilites&quot;. It USED to be so, but has been fixed long ago. Now the abilities like aimed shot, multishot are &quot;normalized&quot; - i.e. generally speaking now their power is counted based on the weapon DPS, not on its one-shot damage. Tested myself. No difference in the abilities power compared to the old 2.60 weap., in fact they've become a bit stronger since the DPS of the boomstick is better. ;)<br />2. Scope. In any way this thing MUST be used scoped. Since the scope just adds +X damage to EVERY SHOT - the scope on the PCB is TWICE more DPS effective than on a &quot;generic&quot; speed 3.0 weapon. <br />3. Pet. In the marksman talent tree there is a nice ability &quot;go for the throat&quot;, which generates 50 Focus to your pet each time you crit. With 1.5 speed autoshot (not abilities) weapon crits are weaker than with a 3.0 speed one, but they happen TWICE more often &quot;per minute&quot; since you make twice more shots over time. So - with the PCB the ability generates twice more focus to your pet - that makes a pleasant boost to your pet's DPS and its ability to hold aggro. (It'd been just AWESOME with a wind serpent before its lightning breath was nerfed :( )<br />4. Aggro. &quot;The less damage per shot - the less agro&quot; and &quot;the more crits - the more focus for the pet Growl&quot; things combined give much more comfortable and aggro-free PVE. ;)<br />5. PVP. Read the posts above about casting interrupts. I think here there is a drawback too - for example against self-healers: a massive crit from a slow weapon can sometimes one-shoot a priest before he realises it's time to heal ;). Even this though can be done with PCB - just use Aimed Shot on this priest ;) PCB almost can't do ONE massive AUTOSHOT crit, but this does NOT affect your DPS, just the way you deal it.&nbsp; <br />6. Ammo. If you at 40+ can't afford as many slugs as you need - forget it, this gun is not for you. If you somehow got it - just sell it on the AH, you need money more than anything ;)<br /><br />And of course, +14 agi looks nice stacked with all other hunter's +agi things.</div>

Had a group of 2 Hunters (BAH!), 1 other Warrior and a Priest buddy of mine.&nbsp; Saw this drop off a maggot in the basement and we were very pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hit greed, in case Hell froze over and neither of the Hunter's needed =P.&nbsp; The idiotic other Warrior Needed, claiming &quot;I use guns and it's an upgrade&quot;.&nbsp; Luckily the Hunter got it.&nbsp; We all *!@#$ed him out and I apologized to the Hunters on the behalf of Warriors that know what they're doing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'd liked to have had this gun to use or sell.&nbsp; But it's a Hunter weapon and I'll let the Hunter have priority every time.&nbsp; <br /><br />It's simple courteousy, I'd want the same thing if it was Witchfury that dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I worked out the numbes and here they are 34.7 @ 1.5 speed = 52.05 damage per hit compared to dwarven ahnd cannon 41 @ 2.90 speed = 118.9 damage per hi on average.. but the Calibrated boomstick shoots almost twice as fast soo its more like 104.1(calibated boomstick) to 118.9(DWC) but once you add a scope... the boomstick gets 2x the damage bonus than the hand cannon does soo using an accuate scope which has +7 damage it works out like this 118.1(boomstick) to 126 (DWC)... but hunters know that more shots mean more crits too and with a gun that shoots 2x as fast you get 2x the cits the finely calibated boomstick gives the Dwarven hand cannon a un for its money and I believe in the hands of a hunter... the finely calibrated boomstick is tuely better... it is a truely amazing gun ( also the fastest shooting gun in the game) this thing is a beast and beats guns 10 levels above it even in purple quality such as the dwarven hand cannon... just amazing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hehe I just loved the boomstick too but that'd be a big mistake to use it till lvl 70. ;)<br />I used it until lvl 62 and I didn't see any &quot;upgrade&quot; weapon until that lvl, the boomstick worked just fine. But everything changes at lvl 62 when you learn &quot;steady shot&quot;. This shot greatly increases a hunter's DPS since this shot doesn't cost lots of mana, has no cooldown and therefore can be spammed between each autoshot. But steady shot has 1.5 sec casting time. So you need a weapon slow enough to cast steady shots not delaying autoshots. My hunter is at lvl 63 ATM and I upgraded the Boomstick for the Splintermark bow at lvl 62. It has 2.5 sec basic speed (and +13% quiver, improved AOTH etc.) , and I'd say this is almost the fastest weapon you're still able to use with Steady Shots (and even with this you have to have fast reaction and low server ping in order not to lose DPS). I beleive that anything faster than 2.5 sec is not so good for a 62+ hunter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I cry when I see hunters with this in pvp, and theyre not troll or bm. Don't get me wrong, this gun is great for pve with serpents quickness, quick shots, rapid fire, and berserking, but its damage range is just way too small and its speed too fast for pvp. Stick to a verdent keeper's aim.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This gun is useless for hunters, hunters need slow guns/bows/xbows to have high arcane/aimed/multi-shot(s) and ofcourse high crits. This is nice for a rogue though because of the high agility, which they will use more then that 10-20 damage more from a slower bow. They will probably not get a better one untill Blackwing Lair. Get Ancient Bone Bow if you want agi on your bow. And this burns bullets to damn fast, you will never be able to earn enough to buy bullets for this. If you want to interrupt caster, go get Broken Tooth!<br /><br />Nice for warriors too if they want to get their armor up with the agility<br /><br />Edited, Mon Aug 29 15:51:25 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sofancy</b></h3>Hello friends apologize for being sort of new at this whole wowhead thing. But i wanted to contribute what information i could about this weapon. Unfortunately i had not downloaded (or even known about) the wowhead client until after this weapon dropped for me, so i suppose you are going to have to take my word for it.<br /><br />Anyways, this weapon dropped for me today on Thunderfury US-PVP server in <a href="/classic/zone=47/the-hinterlands">The Hinterlands</a> as a level 45 warlock questing. It dropped from <a href="/classic/npc=2926/silvermane-stalker">Silvermane Stalker</a>. I had killed maybe about 30 or so of the <a href="/classic/npc=2926/silvermane-stalker">Silvermane Stalker</a> for the quest <a href="/classic/quest=7828/stalking-the-stalkers">Stalking the Stalkers</a>. Which makes me exceptionally lucky, in fact it may be the luckiest i have ever gotten. And needless to say it was exciting. When i saw the purple text i almost had a heart attack.<br /><br />Mind you this is as of 09-20-19 on WoW Classic.<br /><br />Further thoughts i have on this weapon are that after Phase 2 releases for WoW Classic and Battlegrounds are released, this guns price will drastically inflate. As i believe that this is the best twink 49 bracket gun in the game. Current price for this i may be able to get 100 gold on Thunderfury US server. Maybe 200 gold if im incredibly patient. But im going to sit on this one and let its price mature a bit. Its a good long term investment. After the release of Battlegrounds and people start making twink characters this weapon should be able to fetch at least 500 gold if not more than that! <br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thamtam</b></h3>I don't know how is that possible, but this item dropped for me from &quot;Northspring Roguefeather&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JohnJacob</b></h3>As a hunter, this weapon is BAD because it burns thru ammo extremely quickly and can't be &quot;woven&quot; together with Aimed Shot (like a slow weapon can), but it is GOOD because it has potentially the HIGHEST uptime in the game for improved aspect of the hawk (5% chance to get +30% attack speed for 12 seconds) and has a very hard time accidentally drawing you aggro from crits (compared to a slow weapon that might draw you aggro from two big accidental crits in a row). <br /><br />As a lvl 48 rogue, this weapon is one of the best stat sticks possible, that will last me for a very long time... probably until I get a very lucky drop near 60. I was lucky to get it for 50g on my server, but it usually goes for 90-110g.<br /><br />If I got this on my hunter I would have probably sold it since +100g is a pretty sweet deal and I'd be replacing it relatively soon anyway, even if (IMO) it's not as straight up terrible on a hunter as everyone else says it is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pvpallday</b></h3>This weapon is basically a machine gun for hunters. <br /><br />If you take the weapon speed of the gun (1.5 seconds) and factor in the percent attack speed you get from <br /><ul><li> improved aspect of the hawk (30%)</li><li> rapid fire (40%) </li><li> the equip from your ammo bag (10%-15%) </li></ul><br /><br /> = 1.275 seconds<br /><br />You would be shooting 1.275 seconds faster or in other words <b>a top speed of 0.225 seconds per shot</b><br /><br />You could go even further and enchant your head and legs with <a href="/classic/item=18332/libram-of-rapidity">Libram of Rapidity</a> to get an extra 2% attack speed which would then give you a <b>top speed of 0.195 seconds per shot.</b></div>
