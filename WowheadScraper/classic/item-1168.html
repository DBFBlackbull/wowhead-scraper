As far as stats go (excluding the \"equip\"). We see that basically, the difference between the two is that skullflame has 100 more armor, on the other hand draconian has 7 more stamina. While the fire reststance is always a plus for people doing MC , the shadow resistance is more situational and not as usefull for most (BWL). I'd say with the tradeoff between armor and stamina , the difference is almost negligible. \n\nNow for the equip. The draconian deflector has +10 defense. Any tank knows that + defense is his friend. After the defense nerf, I basically need this shield to get near 400 defense. We all know of its use so no reason to elaborate (increase dodge, parry , enemy missrate , decrease enemy critrate)\n\nThe Equip on the skullflame shield somehow doesnt seem as attractive. The 1st one steals 35 life of enemy at 3% of all hits. Tell me if I'm wrong but it seems to me that 105 life every 100 hits isnt that big of a deal. The 2nd equip has a 1% chance of dealing fire damage. The problem with this seems to be that u can unsheep , unshackle and unsap enemies by accident when it procs. Also, it is not really the warrior's role to be concerned with damage. A warrior is best off focusing in his survivability. Extra defense is more needed for him than extra dps. Therefore I'd prefer the draconian deflector's equip extra.\n\nLong story short, for most people (not all [example are those going to BWL or having sufficient defense, which lets face it, arent many]), I'd say the draconian deflector is preferable. And considering the fact that one is free and the other 500g. It seems like a no brainer.

I will warn you, on looks it pales in comparison to the Skullflame. But with slightly better stats and a straight forward path to obtain it, I found I can I live with the Immovable Object's turtle shell appearance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stomphoof</b></h3>I found, through watching a friend of mine, that the damage proc goes off quite a bit, would is good! However, it has a large radius and at the time, constantly broke sheep. We were in UBRS at the time and it was very annoying to have the sheeped Orc Warlocks break and start causing problems. We eventually had him slap on a green shield to tank due to the issues the proc was causing with the bursts of fire.<br /><br />Looks wise, this shield is freakin amazing. I love it, and had the chance to get one for free but decided that I didnt want it. I prefer my tools of doom to be functional as well as awesome looking.<br /><br />Awesome, Yes<br />Functional, NOPE</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moche</b></h3>Had this drop for me in EPL off a Scourge Champion. Very nice looking shield!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bekibash</b></h3>Have seen 2 of em drop in UBRS now, great PVP shields in my opinion, not so hot in crowd control situations.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7155</b></h3>Cool factor is there yes, but there are much better shields to be had out there...Drillborer's Disk comes to mind...as far as something not too hard to obtain if your guild is running MC</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3465</b></h3>You have you realize the staying-power of this shield because the proc for lifestealing, gives 200% bonus from +dmg gear.<br /><br />If you have over 800+dmg/heal gear it will DO 875dmg, and HEAL for 875dmg...<br /><br />This is GREAT if you have a prot paladin in a lot of +dmg gear and your trying to help someone powerlevel. Run through armory and gather everything up, let the thing sit there and proc while you lifesteal constantly.<br /><br />Edit: Unfortunately this is NOT true anymore. They have fixed the proc so it does a fixed amount and even though it says 3% and 1% on the shield I've noticed significant diminishing returns on the amount of procs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I see these being sold for upwards of 500 g all the time on my server, but I dont see why its so special. <br />I must admit that the shield looks amazing, but as a warrior-tank , Im just as happy using my draconian deflector (and saving myself 500g) <br /><br />Draconian deflector vs Skullflame<br /><br />D:2153 Armor,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S:2256 Armor<br />D:40 Block,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S:40 Block<br />D:+7 Stamina,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S:+10 Shadow Resistance<br />D:+10 Fire Resistance,&nbsp; &nbsp; S:+10 Fire Resistance<br />D:Durability 100 / 100,&nbsp; S:Durability 120 / 120<br />D:Requires Level 58&nbsp; &nbsp; S:Requires Level 54<br /><br />D:Equip: Increased Defense +10.<br />S:Equip: When struck in combat has a 3% chance of stealing 35 life from target enemy.<br />S:Equip: When struck in combat has a 1% chance of dealing 75 to 125 Fire damage to all targets around you.<br /><br />Lets try to look at this objectivily (flaming skull omg wtf :D). As far as stats go (excluding the &quot;equip&quot;). We see that basically, the difference between the two is that skullflame has 100 more armor, on the other hand draconian has 7 more stamina. While the fire reststance is always a plus for people doing MC , the shadow resistance is more situational and not as usefull for most (BWL). I'd say with the tradeoff between armor and stamina , the difference is almost negligible. <br /><br />Now for the equip. The draconian deflector has +10 defense. Any tank knows that + defense is his friend. After the defense nerf, I basically need this shield to get near 400 defense. We all know of its use so no reason to elaborate (increase dodge, parry , enemy missrate , decrease enemy critrate)<br /><br />The Equip on the skullflame shield somehow doesnt seem as attractive. The 1st one steals 35 life of enemy at 3% of all hits. Tell me if I'm wrong but it seems to me that 105 life every 100 hits isnt that big of a deal. The 2nd equip has a 1% chance of dealing fire damage. The problem with this seems to be that u can unsheep , unshackle and unsap enemies by accident when it procs. Also, it is not really the warrior's role to be concerned with damage. A warrior is best off focusing in his survivability. Extra defense is more needed for him than extra dps. Therefore I'd prefer the draconian deflector's equip extra.<br /><br />Long story short, for most people (not all ), I'd say the draconian deflector is preferable. And considering the fact that one is free and the other 500g. It seems like a no brainer. Drac deflector ftw</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>At first glance, this shield's stats and bonuses don't look all that great.&nbsp; But on thing not everyone realizes: this shield takes 100% from +damage!&nbsp; So with +60 in damage gear, you would be stealing about 100 life 3% of the time!&nbsp; And the aoe would be dealing average of 160 to all those around you.&nbsp; With the right gear, this shield can be insane.<br /><br />-Hek</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've wanted this shield since lvl 23 when I saw a 60 warrior with it while questing in lakeshire. Finally someone on my server was selling it, I just lvl'd up to 60 after turning in 2 BRD quests when my friend whispers me about the shield. I made an opening bid of 500g and was shut down, but finally got them to let it go for 780g, im broke now but w00t w00t I got my skullflame!<br /><br />Im gunna hide it when I do ubrs so I can get drac/ deflector too 0_-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Make no mistake, for a warrior, the draconic deflector is much better. But for a spell damage paladin? This thing starts to get sick.<br /><br />+Spell damage adds to the life drain proc at a 1-to-1 ratio. With my 5/8 judgement and some other +spell damage items, the drain life is at about 255. With a 3% chance, that isn't too bad, especially when you have 3 or 4 mobs beating on you. When I finish my full set, I should be at about 400ish spell damage, which will make the life drain proc huge, about 435 or so per proc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this shield a while ago and tho i would not recommend it for a warrior for the AoE it is perfect for a shammy or pally. I also agree that it is way over priced</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The 3% Proc is nice, I have a Truesilver Breastplate and the proc does go off a little more often than 3% it feels, but add that with this NICE shield and the life steal..um yummy! As for the 1% AoE fire proc, I have dealt with the Enchant Fire quest in the Badlands and the AoE fire is great solo but in an instance may not be that good. <br /><br />However the fire proc from Badlands is 15% and I was able to control it fine in ZF with the proper pulling, I have since upgraded weapons but the Proc should not be a problem if u do it properly. <br /><br />Hell man, its 1% may not go off all day! This is a great shield, not sure about 300g good though. Aegis of Stormwind usually goes for 25-35g on Burning Legion and its pretty good too for the +15 Stamina if your looking for a decent alternative. My 2c</div>

I've found that it doesn't proc with either ability very often though and when it does, neither special ability is any way great.<br /><br />Still, can't beat it's looks :)</div>

It has happened to me a number of times on my warrior, and i think it sucks. If a warrior is in the group, why not treat it as normal loot and use need rolls first? Happened to me when Foror's Compendium of Dragonslaying dropped and i missed out. Its just really harsh on people that actually need it in my opinion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dropped for me today in and UBRS guild run, me being a warrior, rolled Need, along with the other 2 warriors and i won.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Its the best looking shield imo... as for its usefulness... ya its not that great... no stats but there is +10 fire resist... I got one on Alliance Anetheron... had to have it because it was the first shield that caught my eye a year ago when i first started playing... and never had the chance to get it before... paid 250g for it... then i found a glowin brightwood staff and sold that thing... so im feeling prettyyy good :D got Draconian now... so ill prolly end up using DD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the health proc DOES get FULL Bonus from any +healing ( +spell dmg/healing) gear that you have on. i noticed when i got a +240 health back from &quot;steal life&quot; <br /><br />&gt;:3<br /><br />not sure about the fire proc though, looking into that next.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Mar 19th 2007 7:13pm by herrojimaty</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You wonder why Blizz made every single epic shield so ugly dont you? I mean this shield is about as big as the palm of your characters hand, and almost looks exaclty like wall of the dead and Blackskull Shield. I recently just sold Blackskull shield because it looks so ugly! I wish the shields were larger and made a better emphasise(is that how you spell it) on why it cost 1000000G. I mean c'mon blizzard, at least make it a tower and not some little circle with a skull on it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped for me in Upper spire. <br />Noone wanna buy it also at low prices (like 200g) because all tanks are saying this is the most useless shield in the game.<br />No stats (like +sta, why a shield doesn't have any +stamina ?) , stupid AoE that will unsap and unsheep everything in raid instance , and a not so great armor value.<br />Sacred protector is 100 times better.<br />Anyway if someone is interested /w me on Crushridge EU.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This dropped for me in Lower Blackrocks Spire last week. Its arguably the best shield in the game right now.<br /><br />I cant say ive noticed the life steal but im sure its working given that its 3%. I would say the fire AoE procs more than 1%, it usually goes off three of four times with a few mobs hitting you which gives a nice agro bonus. <br /><br />You have to stay away from poly/shackled/sap mobs otherwise the AoE will break them. For a warrior, moving mobs around shouldnt be a problem.<br /><br />This shield is definately worth is weight in gold.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have to agree with the rest here. Way overprized shield. On my server it goes for 500-800 G on AH. As an MT i wouldn't be caught dead wearing this. In any instance, the crowd controllers (rogues, mages, priests) will hate you each time it's AoE procs and breakes every sap/sheep/shackle around you. It's good for styling in the mayor cities, and perhaps for shield carriers in large raids where the AoE proc won't mess up everything. Better to go with reliable stuff like the DD.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>only paid 200g for mine. I'll agree not too great for a warrior, but on my shaman it is very nice. Especially with a +7 stam enchant.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 29th 2006 at 3:36am EDT by robotic</i></div>

This is the best sheild in the game and mr.knowitall over here didnt stop to think maybe, yes it might be bad for polys and saps, but possibly.. Anything else! Best sheild in game. use with caution when in groups though. FanTASTIC in AOE places.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The 3% Proc is nice, I have a Truesilver Breastplate and the proc does go off a little more often than 3% it feels, but add that with this NICE shield and the life steal..um yummy! As for the 1% AoE fire proc, I have dealt with the Enchant Fire quest in the Badlands and the AoE fire is great solo but in an instance may not be that good. <br /><br />However the fire proc from Badlands is 15% and I was able to control it fine in ZF with the proper pulling, I have since upgraded weapons but the Proc should not be a problem if u do it properly. <br /><br />Hell man, its 1% may not go off all day! This is a great shield, not sure about 300g good though. Aegis of Stormwind usually goes for 25-35g on Burning Legion and its pretty good too for the +15 Stamina if your looking for a decent alternative. My 2c</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the thing that i really want to know about this shield is: 'are the procs affected by +spell damage gear?'<br /><br />i would assume that the life stealing proc is because the other item that are life stealing still are, specifically the hakkari manslayer, because it is considered an offensive proc and not a healing proc like they nerfed in one of the last patches. but they also nerfed some of the AoE procs like the force reactive disk to no longer be effected by the +spell damage gear.<br /><br />if a paladin or shaman who has this could check both procs for me, i would really appreciate it.</div>
