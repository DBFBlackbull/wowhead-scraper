The only thing that comes close is Barbarous Blade with a +25 Agi enchant, the difference between those two is that Barbarous Blade gets 10 AP more, while the Dal'Rend set gives 5 Agi more. 5 Agi vs 10 AP? If you have any logical sense you pick the agi, the only reason not to do so is if you want big Raptor Strikes in PvP. Other weapons that some hunters might think comes close are Ice Barbed Spear, Bone Slicinig Hatchet, Dawn's Edge and even Axe of Rin'ji. They do not come close.\n\nFull Dal'Rend set with +15 agi enchants:\n1% Crit chance.\n50 AP.\n30 Agi.\n4 Strenght (^&*! @ hunters).\n100 Armor (&*!@ @ hunters, unnecessary @ rogues).\n7 Defense (^&*! @ hunters, unnecessary @ rogues).\nNotes: 30 Agi equals around 0.58% crit chance and 60 AP.\n\nBarbarous Blade with 25 Agi enchant:\n1% Crit.\n60 AP.\n25 Agi.\nNotes: 25 Agi equals around 0.48 crit chance and 50 AP.\n\nIce Barbed Spear with 25 Agi enchant:\n46 Agi.\n20 Stam.\n13 Str (^&*! for hunters).\nNotes: 46 Agi equals 0.88% crit and 92 AP, but again it doesnt come close to BBlade or Dal'Rends dmg wise, however 20 Stam is nice for PvP. BBlade gives better ranged dps then this and can still smash out huge raptors. That or 20 Stam. Personal choice imo would BBlade out of these two, though Dal'Rends is still the best ranged dps wise.\n\nBone Slicing Hatchet with +15 Agi enchants:\n56 Agi.\n10 Stam.\nNotes: This is actually an interesting item. If you spec marksmanship this is #$%^ and doesn't come anywhere near Dal'Rends or BBlade. If you spec survival and gets lightning reflexes the story is different though. This gets 1.07% crit and 112 AP without LR, which is crap. With LR however this gives 64 Agi - 1.25% crit and 128 AP.&nbsp; This gives more AP then the Dal'Rend, though it has 0.25% less crit chance. This is pretty dependant on the rest of you gear. The better your gear is the better Dal'Rend will be compared to this, if you are wearing full greens or only a few (less then 3) blues then i'd recommend these, otherwise Dal'Rends are still best.\n\nDawn's Edge with +15 Agi enchants:\n2% Crits.\n30 Agi.\nNotes: 30 Agi equals around 0.60% crit and 60 AP, 2% crit does however not equal 104 Agi, since you dont get any AP from the crit chance. Crit chance will become more and more valuable the more AP you have, since the amount of ekstra dmg you get from each crit will grow. Considering i am only talking pre-mc weapons i do not believe you have enough AP to make these better then Dal'Rends or BBlade, and when you do have enough you will be wielding Lok'Delar, Doom's Edge, Fang of the Faceless or some other end game item.\n\nAxe of Rin'ji with +15 Agi enchants:\n40 Agi.\n22 Stam.\nNotes: Only reason i can see to get this item is for the stamina, however BBlade is imo still better for PvP because of the higher Raptor Strike dmg, and crit is nice for PvP aswell. Otherwise theres IBS which only has 2 stam less, bug gives more dmg in both ranged and melee.\n\nConclusion:\nDal'Rend DOES give the biggest pre-mc ranged dps. As said the BBlade is a good alternative since the only thing you will lose is about 0.10% crit chance, while youl'll get way bigger raptor strikes. If you plan doing any kind of PvP, go for BBlade or IBS, if you dont then go for Dal'Rends.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason a hunter shouldn't be allowed to roll on this, besides the fact that this is the best dps weapons for hunter pre-mc, the rogues will get their weapons upgraded way faster. Brutality Blade and Core Hound Tooth will almost always be rogues-only untill they all have it, and besides we can get our lovely epic staff from MC (after doing the probably toughest quest in the game).\n\n-Redzin","date":"2006-05-19T19:30:16-05:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Redzin","importedSubject":"Clearing everyones mind concerning hunters and Dal'Rends."},{"commentv2":1,"number":16,"id":2680288,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"this is the same crapp about all other items that dropps, if you need an item, you can need on it, if you can use it, you can need on it, but a pally gets valor when a warrior in group need it to, i think that stinks, but me as full prot. specked warrior, the main hand from rend is actualy wery good, so good that i would need roll on it, and the off hand would be nice for dual wielding, that i do every day i am off hunting, so stfu about hunter rogues got the right to get these swords","date":"2006-06-25T07:30:16-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"arioth","importedSubject":"well"},{"commentv2":1,"number":17,"id":2680301,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I am a rogue, but have to admite a fury warrior could use these as much as a rogue can.

I dont play end game anymore. I did a fair few ZG runs etc and to be quite frank i dont enjoy it. I was the GM and MT too much preasure. I rerolled a priest and got bored took time out from the game returned to my warrior to see the new PvP system and the changes made to all aspects, new talents etc. In my opinion since the patch fury is the way to go. For me at least, its alot of fun having been a protection warrior i know just how dull it can be, im sure there are people out there who enjoy being protection and the abilities it provides. If you are well geared in a tank way protection is awesome, mediocure gear people like myself should go for fury or arms. I have full PvP gear and some UBRS drops and am currently along with my best mate real life running UBRS at any opportunity for Dal rends. My friend already has the main hand, and i assure you it makes a big difference to his game. I see why people would call this Rogue or Hunter loot but....its not, you see its as much a fury warrior loot as it is hunter or rogue. We all run instances for our OWN personal gain, you cant deny it. I run for dal rends thats it, and its so annoying when in a group and someone turns round when i call need on dal rends and they say \"No its rogue or hunter\" now, shouldnt I have an equal roll? I mean im running it as well arent I? im tanking and dpsing working just as hard as everyone else? Then im told i cant roll becuase its rogue\/hunter priority. Which (excuse my french) is total bull*!@# if you ask me. A hunter - sure you use melee by why not give it up to a melee class just because people arguments include \"But a warrior should use a shield not dual wield\" I dont want to use a shield, its my character dont make decisions for me. I do agree that Rogues should have a priority. But one that should be equal to a fury warrior. it should be Rogue and Warrior rolling together with a hunter allowed to roll on them if the given classes do not need. I would not go needing on some ranged weapon and call priority cause of some stats, rogue and warrior is melee 100% hunter is more like 30-70 in favour of ranged. So i ask you all to take into consideration warriors, we melee just as much as rogues its our as much as theirs.\nAlso do not roll for the sake of rolling. For instance, no one needs on an item and you take it just because you \"will use it later as a backup\" my ass, vendored or dissed as soon as the raid ends. \nIf you took the time to read this, thanks.

You also have to take into account, reduced energy cost by 5 for SS in Combat tree, 15% increased damage in combat tree from Aggresion, and that they can get 6% chance for extra attacks with swords. Then they can go with Lethality too in the Assassination tree, and increase crit damage done by 30%. So, if you were to  include the increased damage for SS too, the ranges would be about even. But, if you take into regard the reduced SS cost, you can hit SS 3 times right from the get go. Reason for that being because by the time you hit the second SS, it would have regenerated enough energy for that last strike. So a sword rogue can pull of 3 instant attacks, before you can do 2.  With the even damage ranges, that already puts the damage higher than you backstab spec, then you have extra attacks  with swords as a dps bonus. \nDon't get me wrong, loved being a dagger rogue, especially with 21\/8\/20 setup. That setup owns for PvP. But I find that I put out higher sustained dps with swords, than with daggers.

Dal'Rends set:\na) offensive part (more important) is - 50 attack power (AP) 1% critical strike chance (CS);\nb) defensive part (less important) is - 100 armor (AC), 7 defence (DR);\n2. Two Bone Slicing Hatchets:\na) offensive part (more important) - 26 agility (52 AP and 0.49% CS for hunters; 52 AP and 0.89% CS for rogues; 26 AP and 1.3% CS for warriors);\nb) defensive part (less important) - 10 stamina (100 health points to anyone).\nSo in terms of technical part Dal'Rends set is definitely better than two Bone Slicing Hatchets, so \n\nThe moral part (try to estimate common benefits for the whole team).\nFrom my point of view benefits could be calculated as the following:\n1. Mathematically for the whole team benefits from obtaining Dal'Rends set is the following Rogue > Warrior > Hunter;\n2. Molten Core from the beginning can be cleared with random party and contains a lot of epic-quality weapons that could gear up all classes, so pre-raid items are not so valuable and vitally necessary (as for Dal'Rends set, it’s just a fetish but not an absolutely essential equipment).\nSo in terms of moral part, conclusions are the following:\n1. If any raid team wants to equip their melee classes with these swords, they could easily create teams with consul loot system and farm this miserable dungeon (UBRS) as long as they want or as they equip all their members (including mages, paladins, warlocks ect.). They could also sell boosting runs to the second boss (actually it is what they do, just read LFG channel);\n2. If any loot addicted Player (in a good way) wants to get these swords, he\/she just have to create a team with sword reservation (2\/3 or even more groups in LFG channel have particular loot reservations);\n3. If you are in a group of friends you could discuss and decide who will get these swords;\n4.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7735</b></h3>Really great sword to get for a warrior, rogue, or even hunter, especially if you cannot yet raid higher end instances such as MC or ZG. The slow speed makes it hit nice and hard, and the 1 crit is just icing on the cake.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here's the deal on hunters and this weapon set.<br /><br />Most of us try to get weapons and armor that have stats that boost our ranged abilities.&nbsp; If the weapon does good melee dmg, well, fine, that's a bonus.&nbsp; Up until today, the arguably best route for us was a Barb Blade or Ice Barbed Spear with a +9 INT enchant on it it.&nbsp; Those gave us the best boost to our ranged DPS.<br /><br />But, with the 1.6 patch, there will be a +15 AGI enchant to any weapon.&nbsp; That means the best setup will be DW 2 melee weapons with a +15 AGI enchant on each.<br /><br />For us, the Dal'Rends set will be the absolute best option (other than maybe a core hounds tooth and brut blade, which no hunter in their right mind would roll on over a rogue).&nbsp; If a hunter is looking for best ranged DPS boost, this set will be it.&nbsp; There are other melee weapons that most rogues would want over this set, but not hunters.&nbsp; I'm not saying rogues SHOULDN'T &quot;need roll&quot;, just that hunters should too.<br /><br />BTW, in my guild, loot rules are pretty standard: master looter, 1 blue need, 1 blue greed, set pieces don't count against need.&nbsp; Also, roll on bags, boxes, stones, important gems, FFA greens unless BoP, then ask if anyone needs.&nbsp; Simple.<br /><br />edit: This post just kinda confirms and agrees with Koga's, lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a hunter, and this is why I would like the dal'rends set (no i would probably let a rogue have it if he needed it, since this is awesome gear for them).<br /><br />Dal'Rends set:<br />+50 attack power<br />+100 armor<br />+7 defence<br />+1% critical<br />Decent melee damage<br /><br />2xBone Slicing Hatchet (defacto hunter weapons):<br />+26 agility<br />+10 stamina<br />Decent melee damage<br /><br />Now we all know that 1 agility equals 2 ranged attack power (RAP) for a hunter, and 54 agility equals 1% chance for critical strike. Agility also adds a small amount of armor.<br /><br />First off, without +15 agi enchants:<br />Dal'rends Set: 50 RAP, 100 armor, 7 defence, +1% critical<br />2xBone Slicing Hatchets: 52 RAP, 10 stamina, Some armor from agility, about +0.5% critical<br /><br />Second, with +15 agi enchants:<br />Dal'rends Set: 110 RAP, 100 armor, 7 defence, +1.6% critical<br />2xBone Slicing Hatchets: 112 RAP, Some armor from agility, 10 stamina, +1% critical<br /><br />The stats on these combos are so similar we hunters should let the rogues take the dal'rends indeed, but that doesnt mean i wouldnt want it. :)<br /><br />Cheers</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, aside from the great (and old) Hunter / Rogue / Warrior debate, does anyone apart from me think that the reported 3.5% droprate stinks?<br /><br />Is this at all accurate? Pre-1.9 patch I'd seen the offhand sword once, and never this one - it'd be interesting to know if anyone's seen the mainhand pop up with a bit more regularity.<br /><br />Yes, I'm a rogue, and yes, if I could get these swords, I'd probably save my DKP in MC for my armour set and let the hunters fight it out for Brutality Blade :-)<br /><br />Stupid? Maybe. But hey, These look good!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think that rogues and hunters basically have the same rolling rights on this, as it is a very good weapon for both of them.&nbsp; What you should keep in mind, however, is what Dal'Rend's means to a rogue and what it means for a hunter:<br /><br />Rogue: &quot;OMG Dal'Rend's just dropped!&nbsp; It's so much better than my .&nbsp; My damage is going up a whole lot if I win this! (50 damage upgrade)&quot;<br />*Rolls a 7*<br /><br />Hunter:&nbsp; &quot;OO Dal'Rend's!&nbsp; This will make my crit and damage go up a little bit&quot;.&nbsp; *Rolls a 84*<br /><br />The reason a lot of rogues are badmouthing all the hunters and claiming that they would ninja loot epic bows and stuff, is because they are frustrated that they have to go run UBRS so many times to get these swords to drop.&nbsp; When it finally does, Can you really blame their anger at being outrolled by a hunter, who probably didn't run the instance as many times as the rogue.&nbsp; I myself haven't had any problems with hunters rolling on Dal'Rend's, because I have not seen it drop yet lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Cut rogues a break, hunters, as you would be frustrated too if you spent a long time doing runs to get a certain weapon and a rogue comes along and outrolls you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The most commented weapon on <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic">www.wowhead.com/classic</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To everyone who wonders and aint satisfied with the answers that has already been given regarding hunters &quot;roll right&quot; for this sword:<br /><br />The Dal'Rend set with +15 agi enchant on both weapons is the best pre mc/zg/whatever-raid melee weapons a hunter can get. The only thing that comes close is Barbarous Blade with a +25 Agi enchant, the difference between those two is that Barbarous Blade gets 10 AP more, while the Dal'Rend set gives 5 Agi more. 5 Agi vs 10 AP? If you have any logical sense you pick the agi, the only reason not to do so is if you want big Raptor Strikes in PvP. Other weapons that some hunters might think comes close are Ice Barbed Spear, Bone Slicinig Hatchet, Dawn's Edge and even Axe of Rin'ji. They do not come close.<br /><br />Full Dal'Rend set with +15 agi enchants:<br />1% Crit chance.<br />50 AP.<br />30 Agi.<br />4 Strenght (^&amp;*! @ hunters).<br />100 Armor (&amp;*!@ @ hunters, unnecessary @ rogues).<br />7 Defense (^&amp;*! @ hunters, unnecessary @ rogues).<br />Notes: 30 Agi equals around 0.58% crit chance and 60 AP.<br /><br />Barbarous Blade with 25 Agi enchant:<br />1% Crit.<br />60 AP.<br />25 Agi.<br />Notes: 25 Agi equals around 0.48 crit chance and 50 AP.<br /><br />Ice Barbed Spear with 25 Agi enchant:<br />46 Agi.<br />20 Stam.<br />13 Str (^&amp;*! for hunters).<br />Notes: 46 Agi equals 0.88% crit and 92 AP, but again it doesnt come close to BBlade or Dal'Rends dmg wise, however 20 Stam is nice for PvP. BBlade gives better ranged dps then this and can still smash out huge raptors. That or 20 Stam. Personal choice imo would BBlade out of these two, though Dal'Rends is still the best ranged dps wise.<br /><br />Bone Slicing Hatchet with +15 Agi enchants:<br />56 Agi.<br />10 Stam.<br />Notes: This is actually an interesting item. If you spec marksmanship this is #$%^ and doesn't come anywhere near Dal'Rends or BBlade. If you spec survival and gets lightning reflexes the story is different though. This gets 1.07% crit and 112 AP without LR, which is crap. With LR however this gives 64 Agi - 1.25% crit and 128 AP.&nbsp; This gives more AP then the Dal'Rend, though it has 0.25% less crit chance. This is pretty dependant on the rest of you gear. The better your gear is the better Dal'Rend will be compared to this, if you are wearing full greens or only a few (less then 3) blues then i'd recommend these, otherwise Dal'Rends are still best.<br /><br />Dawn's Edge with +15 Agi enchants:<br />2% Crits.<br />30 Agi.<br />Notes: 30 Agi equals around 0.60% crit and 60 AP, 2% crit does however not equal 104 Agi, since you dont get any AP from the crit chance. Crit chance will become more and more valuable the more AP you have, since the amount of ekstra dmg you get from each crit will grow. Considering i am only talking pre-mc weapons i do not believe you have enough AP to make these better then Dal'Rends or BBlade, and when you do have enough you will be wielding Lok'Delar, Doom's Edge, Fang of the Faceless or some other end game item.<br /><br />Axe of Rin'ji with +15 Agi enchants:<br />40 Agi.<br />22 Stam.<br />Notes: Only reason i can see to get this item is for the stamina, however BBlade is imo still better for PvP because of the higher Raptor Strike dmg, and crit is nice for PvP aswell. Otherwise theres IBS which only has 2 stam less, bug gives more dmg in both ranged and melee.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Dal'Rend DOES give the biggest pre-mc ranged dps. As said the BBlade is a good alternative since the only thing you will lose is about 0.10% crit chance, while youl'll get way bigger raptor strikes. If you plan doing any kind of PvP, go for BBlade or IBS, if you dont then go for Dal'Rends.<br /><br />There is absolutely no reason a hunter shouldn't be allowed to roll on this, besides the fact that this is the best dps weapons for hunter pre-mc, the rogues will get their weapons upgraded way faster. Brutality Blade and Core Hound Tooth will almost always be rogues-only untill they all have it, and besides we can get our lovely epic staff from MC (after doing the probably toughest quest in the game).<br /><br />-Redzin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is the same crapp about all other items that dropps, if you need an item, you can need on it, if you can use it, you can need on it, but a pally gets valor when a warrior in group need it to, i think that stinks, but me as full prot. specked warrior, the main hand from rend is actualy wery good, so good that i would need roll on it, and the off hand would be nice for dual wielding, that i do every day i am off hunting, so stfu about hunter rogues got the right to get these swords</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a rogue, but have to admite a fury warrior could use these as much as a rogue can.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got a hunter (main).<br />Got a rogue.<br /><br />They are the best melee weapons outside epic instances for both classes, but the difference between Dal'Rend's/Bone Slicing/Barbaric Blade for a hunter is minimal.<br /><br />These do benefit rogue more, by a <b>large</b> margin.<br /><br />So for any hunters reading this, I'd tell you to pass this for a melee class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a really good set for meele classes, its good for hunters to but..theres bone slicing hatchets for you...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the thing I dont get about this whole hunter/rogue arguement is why do hunters think that they have as much right as a rogue to obtain daggers / swords but when a bow drops, most hunters suddenly think they have priority it, even if its great for a rogue<br /><br />Just like the sword doesnt say class: rogue<br />the bow does not say class: hunter<br /><br />doesnt make sense to me..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im a rogue (smd hunters) and i was ina raid when the othe half dropped. I lost the role to a !@#$%^&amp; and i was like gz....you bastard. Then the leader who was also a rogue who didnt wan't it said &quot;hmm no sorry you cant have it, its a rogue wep&quot; and gave it to me. The hunter left at that point and i couldn't stop laughing<br /><br />Point being that im a casual who will never see ZG, MC ect and for me these are the best weps in the game so if it drops and i got ML looted im gonna $%^&amp; any hunter that roles on it completely over since im a heavy believer that if the hunters believe they get priority on bows we get priority on swords kthxbi</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Having the Sacred charge in your mainhand and felstriker in your off-hand is a combo that I see alot of peoople on my realm using. Infact I have the dal'rend's set and a felstriker on my fury warrior. And I use the Mainhand/felstriker. The +50 AP set bonus holds nothing against the CoH of Felstriker.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I lost a roll on this to a Paladin, gutted, ffs. I hate PUG's.<br /><br />I would have been perfectly happy if a Warrior or Hunter rolled and won it, but a Paladin, how stupid are some people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Me as a hunter, I'd give it to the Rogue/Warrior because they actually use it as their weapon. Imagine as a hunter if Mandokir's Sting drops in ZG and a rogue wants to roll on the weapon that you use for the majority of your DPS. What would the average hunter say? NO. So what happens if these drop? These are basically a hunter's toy that gives us more DPS with ranged, NOT a weapon that we actually use. Rogues and Warriors get guns and bows because they add to their stats, but shouldn't roll against a Hunter when it enters his domain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I myself play a 60 warrior, went fury a few months back. I dont play end game anymore. I did a fair few ZG runs etc and to be quite frank i dont enjoy it. I was the GM and MT too much preasure. I rerolled a priest and got bored took time out from the game returned to my warrior to see the new PvP system and the changes made to all aspects, new talents etc. In my opinion since the patch fury is the way to go. For me at least, its alot of fun having been a protection warrior i know just how dull it can be, im sure there are people out there who enjoy being protection and the abilities it provides. If you are well geared in a tank way protection is awesome, mediocure gear people like myself should go for fury or arms. I have full PvP gear and some UBRS drops and am currently along with my best mate real life running UBRS at any opportunity for Dal rends. My friend already has the main hand, and i assure you it makes a big difference to his game. I see why people would call this Rogue or Hunter loot but....its not, you see its as much a fury warrior loot as it is hunter or rogue. We all run instances for our OWN personal gain, you cant deny it. I run for dal rends thats it, and its so annoying when in a group and someone turns round when i call need on dal rends and they say &quot;No its rogue or hunter&quot; now, shouldnt I have an equal roll? I mean im running it as well arent I? im tanking and dpsing working just as hard as everyone else? Then im told i cant roll becuase its rogue/hunter priority. Which (excuse my french) is total bull*!@# if you ask me. A hunter - sure you use melee by why not give it up to a melee class just because people arguments include &quot;But a warrior should use a shield not dual wield&quot; I dont want to use a shield, its my character dont make decisions for me. I do agree that Rogues should have a priority. But one that should be equal to a fury warrior. it should be Rogue and Warrior rolling together with a hunter allowed to roll on them if the given classes do not need. I would not go needing on some ranged weapon and call priority cause of some stats, rogue and warrior is melee 100% hunter is more like 30-70 in favour of ranged. So i ask you all to take into consideration warriors, we melee just as much as rogues its our as much as theirs.<br />Also do not roll for the sake of rolling. For instance, no one needs on an item and you take it just because you &quot;will use it later as a backup&quot; my ass, vendored or dissed as soon as the raid ends. <br />If you took the time to read this, thanks. If not well you clearly cant accept another opinion and ive wasted my time writing this section :P<br />Duran.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok I do not have a melee class, Druid, mage, lock, priest. I would equate this to running ZG and seeing Will of Arlokk drop. It is + healing, when you heave healing spec'ed druids/priests/shaman they should roll (although priests have preist only staves that are much bettter). However whena&nbsp; shaman who is elemental spec rolls on it for healing...WTF? What is a resto shaman or resto druid doing outside of ZG....Healing! What is a elemental Shaman doine...usually DPS.<br /><br />So to Dal rend...stats alone to not make it. Does that mean if a dagger that has +in, +mana drops but is higher dps should go to a rogue because his gear sucks....no that is just retarded. So what if it has better stats stats are only half of the battle. A melee will get 100% use out of the weapon at best a hunter will get 75% use out of it, end of story.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My experiences with sword, I have outdps'd dagger rogues with just the Thrash Blade as main hand. You also have to take into account, reduced energy cost by 5 for SS in Combat tree, 15% increased damage in combat tree from Aggresion, and that they can get 6% chance for extra attacks with swords. Then they can go with Lethality too in the Assassination tree, and increase crit damage done by 30%. So, if you were to include the increased damage for SS too, the ranges would be about even. But, if you take into regard the reduced SS cost, you can hit SS 3 times right from the get go. Reason for that being because by the time you hit the second SS, it would have regenerated enough energy for that last strike. So a sword rogue can pull of 3 instant attacks, before you can do 2. With the even damage ranges, that already puts the damage higher than you backstab spec, then you have extra attacks with swords as a dps bonus. <br />Don't get me wrong, loved being a dagger rogue, especially with 21/8/20 setup. That setup owns for PvP. But I find that I put out higher sustained dps with swords, than with daggers. I also, for some weird reason, get way less aggro with swords. <br /><br />Edited, Tue Nov 8 23:47:16 2005</div>

WELL THAT IS NOT TRUE!<br />Warriors benefit and a lot of this set but not all type of warriors DW ones. This set is the best u can get for DW warriors fast off-hand to keep agro growing and slow main to damage dealer. For instances runs with a main tank the DW warrior will be there on the top has a damage dealer. Belive me i have seen it and at this moment i have the off-hand and Axe of Deep Wounds in main and cant w8 to have this in stead. So if i see it drop ill roll.<br />On the other hand if u are not a DW warrior and not thinking to be one there i advise not to roll and here leave it to rogues but if u are one dont let it pass try to get the set and enjoy :D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>53 agi = 1% crit chance<br /><br />Dual Bone slicing hatchets (hunter's best weapon choice) yield 56 agi and 10 stamina.<br />thats 112 RAP and 1.05% to crit<br /><br />Dal Rends Set yields 30 agi, 50 RAP, +7 to defense, and +1 % to crit<br />thats 110 RAP and 1.57% to crit<br /><br />So the decrease in 2 RAP is more then made up for in the .52% chance to crit and yet the communities of non hunters choice for best hunter weapon offers no where near what the set offers. I was always under the impresion that that if it can ad a valuble increase to a classes main damage they should be able to roll.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunters have the same right to roll for this sword as rogues do imo. Both need the +1% crit chance. <br /><br />Also, Dawn's Edge is for suckers. Its extremely expensive (about 60g)for a low amount of extra power.<br /><br />I would suggest going dual bone slicing hatchet +15 agi enchant for the real power. Gives more crit chance and normal dps too.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Mar 2 12:34:59 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hi all,<br /><br />Well this is not a rogue weapon has some rogues like to refrase it. This set is very good to DW warriors as well. Fast off-hand to grow and keep agro and slow main to damage dealer. If u get this set ni instances with a main tank the DW warrior will be up on the damage counter and if he knows how to play he will be the first damage dealer, i have seen it.<br />At this point i have dal'rends off-hand and Axe of Deep Wounds in main, both with crusader and in raids im only beated by the best rogue and some times by mage because of AOE and that only on certain instances. I cant w8 to get this main-hand to complete the set. So if u are a DW warrior dont let it pass and try to get the set, but if u are not and arent thinking to be one then i say let it go to rogues or whatever.</div>

When I equip it I have 567 ATK (from the +STR bonus on sacred charge). When I remove the sacred charge I end up with 513 ATK! (-50 from my normal amount).<br /><br />If I re-equip the charge I end up with 517. If I remove it I then have 463 ATK! -100 from my normal amount and a significant gimp.<br /><br />If I equip the charge again I get 517. Weird, only at this point does the bonus start to work and I can't gimp myself any further.<br /><br />Logging out and back in returns my ATK to normal, but I still don't get an ATK power increase from the set.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JohnnyMaverik</b></h3>Regarding the hunter comments from the perspective of a hunter moving into phase 3 playing classic:<br /><br />Well they are the best I can get.<br /><br />I can't get Brutality Blade or Core Hound tooth because rogues and warriors have prio. Even if I was in a DKP guild, im going to take a wild guess that hunters bidding on brutality blade and core hound tooth when there are rogues and warriors who want them is seen by many as a bit of a &amp;*!@ move.<br /><br />In phase 3 two handers with +15 agi enchants are just better for pve (for pvp id still rather have a big slow two hander).<br /><br />So, i cant have my BIS and you know what im fine with that cuz yes, i believe Brutality Blade and Core Hound teeth should go to rogues, warriors and hell in the case of the tooth even tanks (depending on race a little bit) before a hunter were to pick one up. <br /><br />I don't expect to get a raid tier melee weapon until like ZG, and even then I might find some rogues and warriors ahead of me in the pecking order.<br /><br />So yea, sorry I will be going for this and I will be needing on it, even if rogues and warriors need on it. But at the same time I'm not sorry cuz you'd upgrade it a lot sooner than i would and unlike MC or even BWL where rogues and warriors also get plenty of options and hunters get basically none and hey, it's a dungeon drop so if you really want it then keep putting the time in to get it.

Dal'Rends set:<br />a) offensive part (more important) is - 50 attack power (AP) 1% critical strike chance (CS);<br />b) defensive part (less important) is - 100 armor (AC), 7 defence (DR);<br />2. Two Bone Slicing Hatchets:<br />a) offensive part (more important) - 26 agility (52 AP and 0.49% CS for hunters; 52 AP and 0.89% CS for rogues; 26 AP and 1.3% CS for warriors);<br />b) defensive part (less important) - 10 stamina (100 health points to anyone).<br />So in terms of technical part Dal'Rends set is definitely better than two Bone Slicing Hatchets, so <br /><br />The moral part (try to estimate common benefits for the whole team).<br />From my point of view benefits could be calculated as the following:<br />1. Mathematically for the whole team benefits from obtaining Dal'Rends set is the following Rogue &gt; Warrior &gt; Hunter;<br />2. Molten Core from the beginning can be cleared with random party and contains a lot of epic-quality weapons that could gear up all classes, so pre-raid items are not so valuable and vitally necessary (as for Dal'Rends set, it’s just a fetish but not an absolutely essential equipment).<br />So in terms of moral part, conclusions are the following:<br />1. If any raid team wants to equip their melee classes with these swords, they could easily create teams with consul loot system and farm this miserable dungeon (UBRS) as long as they want or as they equip all their members (including mages, paladins, warlocks ect.). They could also sell boosting runs to the second boss (actually it is what they do, just read LFG channel);<br />2. If any loot addicted Player (in a good way) wants to get these swords, he/she just have to create a team with sword reservation (2/3 or even more groups in LFG channel have particular loot reservations);<br />3. If you are in a group of friends you could discuss and decide who will get these swords;<br />4. But… if you are in a random party and loot distribution system is not discussed before the start, it is highly dirty (dishonestly) way to blame hunters for rolling on these swords (especially with words that someone can do something better with Dal'Rends set)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kurtalp</b></h3>As a hunter, I got it on my first UBRS when I was 58 at phase one, like a year ago. And I am still using this set, we even downed c'thun. so I can say its more a hunter weapon than rogue or warrior based on longevity.</div>
