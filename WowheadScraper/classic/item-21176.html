Maybe ancient bonds can be reforged and they can again work together against their common enemy. He asks you to prove yourself by killing Broodlord Lashlayer. Bring an army, but because only one may rise, only one can loot the head. \n\n(We did this on 1\/3\/06 -- I looted the head.) \n\n3) The Path of the Righteous \n\nThe Cenarion NPC is impressed that we killed Broodlord. But in order to earn the trust of the Bronze Dragonflight, we must work tirelessly to purge their ancient enemies from Silithus. He sends me to Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora, and Hive'Regal to kill silithids and return with 200 carapace fragments (quest drops, tradeable). \n\n(I did this -- it took maybe 20-30 minutes of grinding with 8 people in Hive'Ashi. The elites drop 1-3 fragments, or up to 4 in Hive'Regal. Nonelites drop 0 or 1.) \n\n4) The Hand of the Righteous \n\nThe reward for Step #3 is a one-use badge that lets me make someone else an Agent of Nozdormu. That gives them a soulbound item like an Argent Dawn Commission that allows them to collect fragments from killing Silithids as well. Deputized people don't have any quest themselves, but they can farm carapaces and give them to me. Every 200 carapaces I turn in lets me name another deputy. \n\nThis is a repeatable quest. Every turnin of 200 gives me 200 rep with the Brood of Nozdormu. I start, as we all do, at 0\/36000 Hated. Over the course of roughly 60 hours, a small army was mobilized. At the end of the first night, I had 5500 of the needed 42000 reputation. My guild turned out in full force throughout the day on Wednesday to help me farm, and most were deputized in the process. By Wednesday afternoon\/evening, I had enough carapaces to begin deputizing outside EJ. Generous people from Nocturn, Quarantine, VXIX, Aftermath, GS, and other guilds offered their time to assist in the effort. The farming continued throughout the day on Thursday, and Aeternus generously gave us their gathered carapaces. The end was near by Thursday afternoon, we cancelled our raid plans, and settled in for the final grind. Just before midnight on Thursday night, I reached Neutral with the Brood of Nozdormu. \n\n5) Anachronos \n\nI was sent to talk to Anachronos, at the Caverns of Time. When I got there, first off, he offered me one of three epic signet rings. Note that all players will automatically get these once they hit Neutral with Nozdormu by doing AQ, which will happen quickly. Next, he told me that since perhaps I was truly ready and able to aid them, I would need to learn the history of what I was about to get myself into. He sent me back to Silithus, to gaze into a fragment of a time crystal left in the sands by the wall. When I clicked it, dozens of spectral night-elves, anubisath, qiraji, and silithids phased in around me. I stepped back. We watched a battle unfold between them, with the dragons Caelastrasz, Merithra, and Arygos (red, green, blue) flying in to lend air support as the silithids were overcome. I then watched a conversation between Anachronos and the night-elf Fandral play out, the walls sealed, and the scepter shattered. \n\nThese events are depicted and described at great length here: \nhttp:\/\/www.worldofwarcraft.com\/info\/underdev\/1p9\/shiftingsands.html \n\nWhen I returned to Anachronos, he told me that the scepter had been shattered into four, and that four dragons held them. He has one of them. Azuregos, Eranikus, and Vaelastrasz held the other three, and I was to seek them out. \n\n6) The Charge of the Dragonflights (three parallel paths, each which must be completed) \n\n6a) The Blue Flight \n\nI sought out Azuregos, who had, fortunately, happened to spawn right as I was shuttling between Tanaris and Silithus. I begged the assembled forces to wait until I got there to kill him, and they graciously did, and summoned me. (Thanks again, Nerd\/Perdition's.) After an unfortunate misclick, I spoke to Azuregos and learned that he had entrusted his shard to a magical minnow. Yes, a fish. He told me of an arcanite buoy that would lure the fish, and gave me instructions on making one. \n\nOne problem: They're in draconic. He mentioned that Narain Soothfancy in Tanaris might be able to help me. So off I went. \n\nHe explained to me that I needed to fetch for him three things: his book of draconic language, his lost pair of scrying goggles, and a 500-pound chicken. Three parallel quests. \n\nTHE GOGGLES -- Last entrusted to a former friend of his who may be in Silverpine near the Greymane wall. I found him, and just like our good friend Finkle, it seems he was casually strolling through Molten Core and lost them. Thanks, guy. I recently recovered them from an Ancient Core Hound. \n\nTHE CHICKEN -- series of miniquests to farm chimeraoks on the Isle of Dread for their meat, kill Lord Lakmaeran for his carcass, bring them all to Dirge Quickcleave in Gadgetzan, season them with deeprock salt and goblin rocket fuel, and then return the horrible product to Narain. \n\nTHE BOOK -- This is the big one. He said he buried it on an island south of Tanaris. It's on an island beyond fatigue waters, way off the map. Except that when I got there, I just found a ransom note with instructions on where to bring the money in exchange for his book. Ok, so Narain gives me a bag of rocks (fake gold) and a sweet Narain disguise, and a map to the dropoff point, which was at the SE edge of Winterspring at the cliffs looking down upon Azshara. This step was (Elite) so I brought four friends. I go there, wear the disguise, drop the bag, and Dr. Weavil comes puttering in on his flying machine. He lands, comes out, says he sees right through my disguise (hmm, maybe it was the Sulfuras I was holding), and then gets back into his machine, tells \"Number Two\" to take care of me, and flies off. A huge yeti-gorilla creature comes out. Kind of like a 5-man instance boss, nothing too bad. He dies. We go back to Narain, who tells me that Dr. Weavil lives on Alcaz Island (NE of Dustwallow). So off we go. We bring a small army to the evil doctor's hideout, and beat him to death. I recover from his corpse one chapter of the book, and a diary chronicling his emo rage as he ripped the book into eight pieces and threw seven of them all over the world. One in Tainted Scar, one in Darkwhisper Gorge, one in Onyxia's chimney, one in Molten Core, one in BWL, one in Undercity, and one in Stormwind (!). \n\nAfter gathering the chapters and assembling the completed manual, I learned of the various precious materials required to craft the buoy. I presented them, and received the buoy. \n\nWe took the buoy to a maelstrom in the Bay of Storms in Azshara, and used it, and up swam Maws, a shark of gigantic proportions. Not too tough, but with 1mil hp, frenzies like Magmadar, and an AoE, so it took a little while. From its corpse I retrieved the Blue Scepter Shard. One down, two to go! \n\n6b) The Green Flight \n\nThis was cool. I went to see the sleeping shade of Eranikus in ST. As soon as I entered the room, Malfurion Stormrage phased in between me and the dragon. He told me that Eranikus has been corrupted by the Old Gods and that I needed to cleanse him in order to recover the scepter shard. He sends me to speak with an agent of his outside of Darnassus(!). I did that. The agent sent me to Keeper Remulos in Moonglade. Remulos told me of Eranikus's corruption, and how he wants nothing more than revenge upon Malfurion and upon the Moonglade. He might be lured into a trap, but it would require the recovery of four shards of the corrupted dream, from each of the four dragon portals around the world. Three of them are held by the dragonkin near the portals (raredrops from the dragonkin; they do not drop from the green dragons themselves). The fourth is in Duskwood, which has no trash, but where a demonic Twilight Corruptor awaited me, phasing in as I approached the moonwell there. He was tough (40-man raid mob), but we took him out. The drop rate on the other fragments is awful -- it took 3.5 hours of nonstop farming in Feralas to get that one, and 1.5+ at Hinterlands. Ashenvale has so few dragonkin that it also proved problematic with the new lengthened respawns, but at last we had all four shards. \n\nI brought them back to Keeper Remulos in the Moonglade, and he used them to lay a trap for Eranikus. Eranikus has been in the corrupted Emerald Dream, twisted by the will of the Old Gods, brooding and yearning for revenge against Malfurion and the Cenarion Circle. The fragments were used to open a portal into the heart of the Dream, and Eranikus emerged over the Moonglade lake. With hundreds of people gathered to defend Moonglade (and to watch), an epic battle was waged against dozens of Nightmare Phantasms that emerged from the portal, as Eranikus hovered menacingly in the skies. Aeternus, Aftermath, Advent, LoH, Exordium, and countless others, all turned out to assist us, and I thank them. As the phantasms were defeated, Eranikus landed to do the job himself. He was controlled, and we began to wear him down. As the fight went on, Tyrande arrived from Darnassus (the point of my trip to Darnassus had been to covertly notify her) with a half-dozen Priestesses of the Moon riding white tigers. They healed the army as we continued to rain blows on Eranikus, and Tyrande and Remulos fought against him side-by-side. As he weakened further, Tyrande channelled the powers of Elune in a prayer to redeem the cursed dragon. He thrashed and resisted, but ultimately the light of Elune overcame him. He suddenly ceased fighting. The dragon vanished, and in its place lay a crumpled night-elf on the ground. He stood up and haltingly apologized for all the harm he had wrought, and left to attempt to begin to make amends for his actions. Before leaving, however, he entrusted me with the green scepter shard that Anachronos had given him long ago. I returned it to Anachronos. \n\nAnachronos now holds the blue and green shards, in addition to the bronze one he has kept. Only one remains: \n\n6c) The Red Flight \nVaelastrasz was entrusted with the red shard. Unfortunately, he ran into a bit of trouble. He lay injured and defeated inside Blackwing Lair, having been overpowered and injured by Nefarian. Talking to him, before the fight, he told me that Nefarian had taken the shard, and was seeking to corrupt its power and destroy it. If I wanted it, I was going to have to reach Nefarian and get it back... before it was destroyed. \n\nSo, a race to clear BWL. We frantically tore through the zone to reach Nefarian, as he taunted us and proclaimed his victory along the way. We got there in ample time. We killed Nefarian, and we took the shard back from his corpse. \n\nI hurried to Anachronos in Tanaris, and brought him the shard. \n\nHe heralded me as the true champion and savior of Kalimdor, and handed me the reconstructed Scepter of the Shifting Sands, to be used when the Horde and the Alliance were ready to wage war against the forces of C'Thun","date":"2006-06-20T20:59:27-05:00","rating":292,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"goldentauren","importedSubject":"a very little chain ><"},{"commentv2":1,"number":7,"id":3084653,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"i heard that if you can gong the bell and defeat the 4 summend dragon it can be obtainable but dunno if it is true cuz if it is true you still have the chance to get that bug for riding","date":"2006-04-03T14:33:08-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Tarhl","importedSubject":"can be obtainable STILL!!!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":8,"id":3084654,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Tigole confirmed, that this mount can only be attained by the first person completing the questchain to open the gates of AQ and any other person completing the quest within [b]10 hours[\/b] of the first person completing it.","date":"2006-01-28T14:57:02-06:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Chopas","importedSubject":"limited edition"},{"commentv2":1,"number":9,"id":3084655,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"waitin for world quest.. want my mount ^^","date":"2006-01-31T23:36:20-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Freeaakkzz","importedSubject":"damn waitin"},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":3084656,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Think it should be around 125% mount speed, but donno if that is true tbh.","date":"2006-02-12T04:52:26-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Meaks","importedSubject":"RE: speed"},{"commentv2":1,"number":11,"id":3084657,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"sick looking mount. don't care though. not worth the effort to gain 1 second of cast time. a mage will sheep you and that's it. end of mount.","date":"2006-02-27T18:34:34-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"babaracusburn","importedSubject":"yeah"},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"id":3084658,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Ok so i dont know much about this but the quick cast makes it a huge advantage in a pvp situation right?

After that, this mount is unattainable. <br /><br />This mount functions as a normal mount outside of AQ40, but is limited inside AQ40 and desummons when you take any damage, or are put in to combat, just like the ones that drop off of the trash in AQ40.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nolimit</b></h3>Rare mount, it looks cool when you ride bug outside, those who have it are lucky bastards ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>598</b></h3>The only Bug mount that you can ride outside of AQ40. The only way to get this coveted mount was by completeing the gate opening quest line and as said above hitting the gong within 10 hours of the opening. the Quest line started with the head of broodlord lashlayer and was extremely long with some very difficult tasks to complete. the quests start out easy and soloable but quickly progress into 10 20 and 40 man raid bosses. between finding 8 pages of &quot; draconic for dummies&quot; that were scattered all around the world or fighting off Maws, the &quot;minnow&quot; that Azuregos gave his scepter shard to. Those that complete this quest are certainly worthy of the black bug mount as well as some of the other rewards that come from it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sykx</b></h3>This item is currently bugged (no pun intended). You can cast it, as if to mount, almost anywhere (even in combat), but you cannot physically mount it. You will get the &quot;can't mount here&quot; or &quot;cannot mount while in combat&quot; messages. However, being able to cast it a couple seconds before leaving combat is pretty nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>izlude</b></h3>This item is only obtainable on servers that have closed AQ gates or gates that have opened in the last hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Enjoy, <br />DK <br /><br />1) What Tomorrow Brings <br /><br />NPC in Cenarion Hold says &quot;Hey guys I hear there's a dragon who despawns at 20% and says something about it not being his time in Tanaris.&quot; You go see Anachronos at the Caverns of Time -- return to CH, tell the NPC. <br /><br />(Everyone can do this.) <br /><br />2) Only One May Rise <br /><br />The Cenarion NPC is excited to hear of the return of the Bronze Dragonflight. Maybe ancient bonds can be reforged and they can again work together against their common enemy. He asks you to prove yourself by killing Broodlord Lashlayer. Bring an army, but because only one may rise, only one can loot the head. <br /><br />(We did this on 1/3/06 -- I looted the head.) <br /><br />3) The Path of the Righteous <br /><br />The Cenarion NPC is impressed that we killed Broodlord. But in order to earn the trust of the Bronze Dragonflight, we must work tirelessly to purge their ancient enemies from Silithus. He sends me to Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora, and Hive'Regal to kill silithids and return with 200 carapace fragments (quest drops, tradeable). <br /><br />(I did this -- it took maybe 20-30 minutes of grinding with 8 people in Hive'Ashi. The elites drop 1-3 fragments, or up to 4 in Hive'Regal. Nonelites drop 0 or 1.) <br /><br />4) The Hand of the Righteous <br /><br />The reward for Step #3 is a one-use badge that lets me make someone else an Agent of Nozdormu. That gives them a soulbound item like an Argent Dawn Commission that allows them to collect fragments from killing Silithids as well. Deputized people don't have any quest themselves, but they can farm carapaces and give them to me. Every 200 carapaces I turn in lets me name another deputy. <br /><br />This is a repeatable quest. Every turnin of 200 gives me 200 rep with the Brood of Nozdormu. I start, as we all do, at 0/36000 Hated. Over the course of roughly 60 hours, a small army was mobilized. At the end of the first night, I had 5500 of the needed 42000 reputation. My guild turned out in full force throughout the day on Wednesday to help me farm, and most were deputized in the process. By Wednesday afternoon/evening, I had enough carapaces to begin deputizing outside EJ. Generous people from Nocturn, Quarantine, VXIX, Aftermath, GS, and other guilds offered their time to assist in the effort. The farming continued throughout the day on Thursday, and Aeternus generously gave us their gathered carapaces. The end was near by Thursday afternoon, we cancelled our raid plans, and settled in for the final grind. Just before midnight on Thursday night, I reached Neutral with the Brood of Nozdormu. <br /><br />5) Anachronos <br /><br />I was sent to talk to Anachronos, at the Caverns of Time. When I got there, first off, he offered me one of three epic signet rings. Note that all players will automatically get these once they hit Neutral with Nozdormu by doing AQ, which will happen quickly. Next, he told me that since perhaps I was truly ready and able to aid them, I would need to learn the history of what I was about to get myself into. He sent me back to Silithus, to gaze into a fragment of a time crystal left in the sands by the wall. When I clicked it, dozens of spectral night-elves, anubisath, qiraji, and silithids phased in around me. I stepped back. We watched a battle unfold between them, with the dragons Caelastrasz, Merithra, and Arygos (red, green, blue) flying in to lend air support as the silithids were overcome. I then watched a conversation between Anachronos and the night-elf Fandral play out, the walls sealed, and the scepter shattered. <br /><br />These events are depicted and described at great length here: <br /><a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/1p9/shiftingsands.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/1p9/shiftingsands.html</a> <br /><br />When I returned to Anachronos, he told me that the scepter had been shattered into four, and that four dragons held them. He has one of them. Azuregos, Eranikus, and Vaelastrasz held the other three, and I was to seek them out. <br /><br />6) The Charge of the Dragonflights (three parallel paths, each which must be completed) <br /><br />6a) The Blue Flight <br /><br />I sought out Azuregos, who had, fortunately, happened to spawn right as I was shuttling between Tanaris and Silithus. I begged the assembled forces to wait until I got there to kill him, and they graciously did, and summoned me. (Thanks again, Nerd/Perdition's.) After an unfortunate misclick, I spoke to Azuregos and learned that he had entrusted his shard to a magical minnow. Yes, a fish. He told me of an arcanite buoy that would lure the fish, and gave me instructions on making one. <br /><br />One problem: They're in draconic. He mentioned that Narain Soothfancy in Tanaris might be able to help me. So off I went. <br /><br />He explained to me that I needed to fetch for him three things: his book of draconic language, his lost pair of scrying goggles, and a 500-pound chicken. Three parallel quests. <br /><br />THE GOGGLES -- Last entrusted to a former friend of his who may be in Silverpine near the Greymane wall. I found him, and just like our good friend Finkle, it seems he was casually strolling through Molten Core and lost them. Thanks, guy. I recently recovered them from an Ancient Core Hound. <br /><br />THE CHICKEN -- series of miniquests to farm chimeraoks on the Isle of Dread for their meat, kill Lord Lakmaeran for his carcass, bring them all to Dirge Quickcleave in Gadgetzan, season them with deeprock salt and goblin rocket fuel, and then return the horrible product to Narain. <br /><br />THE BOOK -- This is the big one. He said he buried it on an island south of Tanaris. It's on an island beyond fatigue waters, way off the map. Except that when I got there, I just found a ransom note with instructions on where to bring the money in exchange for his book. Ok, so Narain gives me a bag of rocks (fake gold) and a sweet Narain disguise, and a map to the dropoff point, which was at the SE edge of Winterspring at the cliffs looking down upon Azshara. This step was (Elite) so I brought four friends. I go there, wear the disguise, drop the bag, and Dr. Weavil comes puttering in on his flying machine. He lands, comes out, says he sees right through my disguise (hmm, maybe it was the Sulfuras I was holding), and then gets back into his machine, tells &quot;Number Two&quot; to take care of me, and flies off. A huge yeti-gorilla creature comes out. Kind of like a 5-man instance boss, nothing too bad. He dies. We go back to Narain, who tells me that Dr. Weavil lives on Alcaz Island (NE of Dustwallow). So off we go. We bring a small army to the evil doctor's hideout, and beat him to death. I recover from his corpse one chapter of the book, and a diary chronicling his emo rage as he ripped the book into eight pieces and threw seven of them all over the world. One in Tainted Scar, one in Darkwhisper Gorge, one in Onyxia's chimney, one in Molten Core, one in BWL, one in Undercity, and one in Stormwind (!). <br /><br />After gathering the chapters and assembling the completed manual, I learned of the various precious materials required to craft the buoy. I presented them, and received the buoy. <br /><br />We took the buoy to a maelstrom in the Bay of Storms in Azshara, and used it, and up swam Maws, a shark of gigantic proportions. Not too tough, but with 1mil hp, frenzies like Magmadar, and an AoE, so it took a little while. From its corpse I retrieved the Blue Scepter Shard. One down, two to go! <br /><br />6b) The Green Flight <br /><br />This was cool. I went to see the sleeping shade of Eranikus in ST. As soon as I entered the room, Malfurion Stormrage phased in between me and the dragon. He told me that Eranikus has been corrupted by the Old Gods and that I needed to cleanse him in order to recover the scepter shard. He sends me to speak with an agent of his outside of Darnassus(!). I did that. The agent sent me to Keeper Remulos in Moonglade. Remulos told me of Eranikus's corruption, and how he wants nothing more than revenge upon Malfurion and upon the Moonglade. He might be lured into a trap, but it would require the recovery of four shards of the corrupted dream, from each of the four dragon portals around the world. Three of them are held by the dragonkin near the portals (raredrops from the dragonkin; they do not drop from the green dragons themselves). The fourth is in Duskwood, which has no trash, but where a demonic Twilight Corruptor awaited me, phasing in as I approached the moonwell there. He was tough (40-man raid mob), but we took him out. The drop rate on the other fragments is awful -- it took 3.5 hours of nonstop farming in Feralas to get that one, and 1.5+ at Hinterlands. Ashenvale has so few dragonkin that it also proved problematic with the new lengthened respawns, but at last we had all four shards. <br /><br />I brought them back to Keeper Remulos in the Moonglade, and he used them to lay a trap for Eranikus. Eranikus has been in the corrupted Emerald Dream, twisted by the will of the Old Gods, brooding and yearning for revenge against Malfurion and the Cenarion Circle. The fragments were used to open a portal into the heart of the Dream, and Eranikus emerged over the Moonglade lake. With hundreds of people gathered to defend Moonglade (and to watch), an epic battle was waged against dozens of Nightmare Phantasms that emerged from the portal, as Eranikus hovered menacingly in the skies. Aeternus, Aftermath, Advent, LoH, Exordium, and countless others, all turned out to assist us, and I thank them. As the phantasms were defeated, Eranikus landed to do the job himself. He was controlled, and we began to wear him down. As the fight went on, Tyrande arrived from Darnassus (the point of my trip to Darnassus had been to covertly notify her) with a half-dozen Priestesses of the Moon riding white tigers. They healed the army as we continued to rain blows on Eranikus, and Tyrande and Remulos fought against him side-by-side. As he weakened further, Tyrande channelled the powers of Elune in a prayer to redeem the cursed dragon. He thrashed and resisted, but ultimately the light of Elune overcame him. He suddenly ceased fighting. The dragon vanished, and in its place lay a crumpled night-elf on the ground. He stood up and haltingly apologized for all the harm he had wrought, and left to attempt to begin to make amends for his actions. Before leaving, however, he entrusted me with the green scepter shard that Anachronos had given him long ago. I returned it to Anachronos. <br /><br />Anachronos now holds the blue and green shards, in addition to the bronze one he has kept. Only one remains: <br /><br />6c) The Red Flight <br />Vaelastrasz was entrusted with the red shard. Unfortunately, he ran into a bit of trouble. He lay injured and defeated inside Blackwing Lair, having been overpowered and injured by Nefarian. Talking to him, before the fight, he told me that Nefarian had taken the shard, and was seeking to corrupt its power and destroy it. If I wanted it, I was going to have to reach Nefarian and get it back... before it was destroyed. <br /><br />So, a race to clear BWL. We frantically tore through the zone to reach Nefarian, as he taunted us and proclaimed his victory along the way. We got there in ample time. We killed Nefarian, and we took the shard back from his corpse. <br /><br />I hurried to Anachronos in Tanaris, and brought him the shard. <br /><br />He heralded me as the true champion and savior of Kalimdor, and handed me the reconstructed Scepter of the Shifting Sands, to be used when the Horde and the Alliance were ready to wage war against the forces of C'Thun</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok so i dont know much about this but the quick cast makes it a huge advantage in a pvp situation right? Well if i am understanding this correctly you need a guild to get this with. Well most of the guilds i've seen aren't pvp based, they are raiding based so what really is the point of making this the result of that type of quest? How about make something like that as a pvp reward? Reply so that i can understand it a little more because I may not have all my facts right.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It has 100% speed like the other mounts, but there are some differences.<br />-Its instant cast which effectively makes it a bit faster and a huge advantage in PvP<br />-The other crystals can only be used in AQ<br />-Regular mounts cannot be used in AQ40 except at the beginning<br /><br />About the AQ scepter line, you can do it after the gates have been opened and reap some other pretty rewards, but this one is only for people that turn the scepter in within 10 hours of the first bong. Considering the effort, there will be 3 people tops per server with this mount, less if the server guilds decide to let one guild do this and the rest focuses on the war effort.<br />And there won't be many more that ever bother with this quest to the full extend afterwards, the cost for the blue line is insane just for a ring that lets you breathe underwater...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>All in the title. This purely rocks !<br /><br />Erm... Btw, as far as I understood, such kind of reward can only be picked up by the group who opens the Ahn'Qiraj's doors right ? So, am I the only one feeling a bit unfair that many of us collected goods (metal ore, herbs...) to open AQ doors and only the first group who bangs the gong got this ? <br /><br />Or am I completly out of the way ?<br /><br />Edited, Fri Mar 31 03:11:52 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I heard its a pain in the ass quest chain, and you need to kill Eye of E'cune. and tuch the dong behind him...<br />even though, i dont like that chinesian players get those things, i mean about 20 peoples would managed to get that quest done whitin 10 hours.<br />(same whit those murlocks that they give away to &quot;Special custumors&quot; i mean wtf, why should someone get those kinds of atvantages =/ im on the tap of quite playing WoW because of this! I am SICK of these kinds of items</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a complete speculation (mixed with rumors i have heard) but...<br /><br />I have heard that during the 8 hrs after the gong is rung, the mount can still be obtained. If you complete the quest chain all the way up to the ringing of the gong (probably it is best to have done this a before the gong is rung), and then do whatever to turn the quest in <b> during those 8 hrs. </b> , you still gets the mount. <br /><br />Now this is just what I've heard so if some other folks, who have done this or would know, would reply to this with an answer... that be good</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1ST POST! legendery? Swift Zulian Tiger only got Epic heh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OMG IT&quot;S SO COOL ! But wha'ts the requirement to get this mount? who drop this? So far no infor about that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>According to a post on the other coloured AQ40-only crystals, all the AQ mounts (including this one) give a 100% speed increase, just like normal epics. The only bonus to getting it is as a status symbol. Sure, I wouldbe pretty happy if I could get it, but I'm not that fussed about it when the only difference is the visuals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've heard a few other rumors about these things, besides the 'instant cast' story...among others, I've heard from several sources that these can FLY. I'm finding it hard to believe that Blizz would release a fully functional, in-game flying mount before even releasing screenshots of the flying mounts that will be available in Burning Crusade...could someone who has this mount confirm/debunk this? If it's true, I'd really like to see a screenshot of it flying. Also, I've heard it allows you to stealth while mounted, which may have arisen from the bug about unstealthing mentioned earlier. The hardest rumor for me to believe is that the mount itself hits for close to 3,000 damage...while I can't believe that, I'm wondering if maybe it allows you to attack while mounted or during the cast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It works just like any epic mount people... Lol it does not fly nor does it insta cast! It is a reward form the quest to open the AQ gates... When the Gong to the AQ gates is rung there is something like a 10 hr time frame if you happen to have the mace (quest chain) ready you too can ring the gong and get the mount as well. Once that time frame is up no more can be aquired on that server. It is a One time event per server. Plain and simple.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shelgeyr70</b></h3>This might be a really stupid question, but is there any chance that obtaining this in Classic might ultimately lead to it being available in &quot;regular&quot; WoW?<br />I imagine Classic will eventually gain access to the same &quot;Collections&quot; system, and I know mounts/pets are Blizzard account level, so it seems to me this might actually be the case unless Classic is completely walled-off.<br />Anyone know for sure?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Azzinothed</b></h3><b>Some info on this mount: </b><br /><br /><ul><li>Has no casting animation. (This has now been changed with Phase 6. There is now a casting animation like all mounts.)</li></ul><br /><ul><li>It is 100% speed.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>This does dismount you in Ahn'Qiraj Temple entering combat. It works just the same as the others.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Can be cast in combat but does not mount you unless you leave combat by the end of the cast.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Can be cast while already mounted assuming you cancel your previous mount before the end of the cast. This makes you appear to have instantly changed mounts. </li></ul><br /><br />Have no idea why this is being downvoted though. These are all legitimate facts with this mount.</div>
