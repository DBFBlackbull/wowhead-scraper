<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I recieved a decoded twilight text that basically said &quot;our glorious cause is finding support everywhere from darkshore to searing gorge to our master's servant Aku'Mai in BFD&quot;<br /><br />So i went and ran thru BFD and whacked Aku'mai at the very end. Nothing pertinent to the twilight quests dropped from him, so save your time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here's the text from one I found:<br /><br />For immediate dissemination to all Twilight Hammer members.<br /><br />Given the current state of affairs in Silithus, all distribution of True Believer texts are to be made under the escort of no less than four armed Twilight Hammer personnel.<br /><br />Any members found in violation of this new policy will be summarily punished.<br /><br />-Twilight Lord D'Sak</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>State of the Cult. Volume 233<br /><br />Opportunity knocks yet again, my brothers and sisters!&nbsp; The Cenarion Circle, a vile cult of nature lovers, now sends agents against us.&nbsp; They must want to stop us from summoning red luring stones.&nbsp; We cannot allow it!<br /><br />The red stones are critical to our new allies.&nbsp; We mustn't let the Cenarion Circle's lapdogs succeed.&nbsp; Stand firm, my faithful friends.&nbsp; Stand firm!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These gusy make The Cenarion Circle look like hippes...<br />&quot;The Cenarion Circle, a vile cult of nature lovers&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Stats of the Cult, Volume 92<br /><br />It is with a joyous heart that I greet<br />you, my brethren, for the state of our<br />cult could not be more grand. We are<br />Legion, and our goals grow ever<br />closer to fruition.<br /><br />New recruits continue to gather. The<br />sing praise to our lords in Darkshore,<br />they bow in jubilant reverie within<br />the Searing Gorge, they embrace our<br />masters' servant. Aku'mai, in<br />Blackfathom Deeps. Indeed, my<br />brothers and sisters, soon a swarm of<br />the faithful will blanket all of<br />Azeroth!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How do we know they love us?<br /><br />Some may wonder how the Old Gods<br />and their minions can love us. Do they<br />not kill us? Do they not cause pain<br />and suffering to all? How could<br />beings sent on malevolence know<br />love in their hearts?<br /><br />There is a simple answer to this<br />question. So simple it need not be<br />uttered.<br /><br />Faith. Faith is the wellsrping from<br />which the joy of servitude showers us.<br />Faith will keep us warm on the coldest<br />Silithus nights. Faith will keep us in<br />our Lords' good graces when the<br />Ending Days arrive.<br /><br />Faith will save us.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>u still haven't told us what to do with them. i got an encrypted one and i have no idea what to do but apparently you can summon things with them?<br />where do u give em in?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The icon say it will stack up to 20, but it wont stack at all.<br /><br />I think the texts are for the RPG part in the game.<br />Some background stories and on.<br />Perhaps a bonus if you read them all... ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Juliper's comment is incorrect. It's the encrypted ones you turn in, not the decoded ones.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, these decoded texts have no use other than (sometimes humourous) messages. But that begs the question, why are they white not grey?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So is it worth handing them into Ortel? does soemthing happen if you give him enough? Or is it worth handing them in for Reputation?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>k i read all these posts and not one explaines what ur supposed to do with <br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />not the ENCRYPTED i dont know whats so hard to understand the difference between the 2 stop postin the same crap over and over and post the purpose of &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; ty</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Several posts have indicated that these are just for the lore, and otherwise useless. lrn2read kthxbye</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got ONE scroll and two Decrypted texts for my encrypted turn-in. Plans for NR gear don't even interest an alchemist, so from now on, the texts go to the other dude for rep. The Hermit can stay in his cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Decoded Texts sell to vendors for 5 silver each.&nbsp; That seems to be their most useful purpose.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>One that I received said something about Van Cleef. It can't be that relevant to how to do the summons :-P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I received a 'Scroll: Create Crest of Beckoning' which is pretty darn nice.<br /><br />Regards</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have many, many of these from farming the 'ENCODED' texts... they seem to have no function other than selling.. but Not sure what to think.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>DECODED..... white..but no purpose that we know of<br /><br />ENCRYPTED.....white as well.. but need 10 for a quest (maybe 20..forgot) and after that it's all about REP baby!<br /><br />and funny how the person that says they read all the posts still didn't get it.. things that make you go HMMMMM o.O</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Handing these in to this guy is a waste. Do it once for the exp if you need it, apart from that I believe Cenarion Circle rep will be much more rewarding than a stupid scroll or a pattern/recipe that sells for 1g on AH. 10 texts go for much more than that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got three blue recipes in the first bag from the hermit after handing in 20 encrypted texts....ended up making 113g tonight on Shadow Council. I guess noone's been handing them in to him ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>handed in 40 texts to the hermit after reading comments from here and got NOTHING<br /><br />dont bother handing it into the stupid dodgy rat</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I know these are generally gotten by unlucky saps trying for their runed stygian recipes.&nbsp; Are these really also dropped from various Alliance/Horde NPCs, as Thottbot suggests?&nbsp; It would make sense I guess for some... it is said after all that many members of the Twilight's Hammer and its related cults have inflitrated every level of Alliance and Horde society.<br /><br />However, it could just be another fluke on Thottbot's part.&nbsp; Similar to how every item in the game apparently disenchants into Morrowgrain.<br /><br />My bet is that it's a fluke, since I'd be rightfully pissed if this actually dropped off The Beast in UBRS.&nbsp; I'd be interested to hear if anyone has ever heard of decoded twilight texts dropping off NPCs, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>7 posts above indicate you can turn in the Decoded Twilight Texts.&nbsp; (patterns/recipes, RE:Hermit turn in, Do not waste your texts on this guy!, Good Stuff?, BAH, not true..., and Just Wait.)<br /><br />3 posts above indicate you can only sell these items to vendors.&nbsp; (No use for these, To the Above, and POINT IS...)<br /><br />Who is correct?&nbsp; Can someone purge the bad data?&nbsp; Thottbot is getting more and more useless with this kind of sloppy posting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My understanding is that the hermit wants the ENcoded TT's in exchange for XP and goodies.&nbsp; However the ETT's can also be handed in at Cenarion Hold to Bor Wildmane at 48,37 for reputation which in turn allows you to buy cool patterns from Mishta the General Trade Goods Vendor. What is available for sale depends on your reputation status. <br /><br />The DEcoded TT iirc is a by-product from doing the hermit quest and has no in game value other than selling for 5 silver to the vendor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Only hunter can read this.</div>
