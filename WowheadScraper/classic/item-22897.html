<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Had three runs myself, nothing to loot yet..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can every mage in the group loot a copy or is there just 1 ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item drops off of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14597">Archivist Galford</a> in Stratholme on the &quot;Live&quot; or &quot;SM&quot; side.&nbsp; He is right before the final boss on the Live side named Balnazzar, in a small room opposite the door to Balnazzar's chamber.&nbsp; <br /><br />This was added in Patch 1.11, refer to the patch note:<br /><br />&quot;Mages: Conjure Food now has a new rank (Rank 7) available in Stratholme.&quot;<br /><br />This item is not green or blue like any traditional rare item.&nbsp; It is white.&nbsp; This means that in a five man party, it is simply whoever's turn to loot it.&nbsp; They will see the tome <i>AFTER</i> all other loot has been distributed.&nbsp; Other party members will see the &quot;moneybags&quot; cursor, but will not see anything in the loot window.&nbsp; It is BOE, so whoever loots it can distribute it accordingly.&nbsp; Think of it like the Scholomance Viewing Room Key.&nbsp; <br /><br />It took me four tries to get this tome, and the priest in my group gave it to me.&nbsp; I did each run (including Cannonmaster Wiley) in under an hour with a guild group, mostly decked out in Molten Core, Blackwing Lair and Temple of Ahn'Qiraj Gear.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>done it 10 time with no drop. but made a lot of gold, and got a lot of orbs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It dropped for me the first time. However, when i clicked the corps i didnt see it. Then someone said they saw it, so i checked again and it was there. Kinda weird, make sure everyone checks the loot for you of you might miss it! GL mages, and enjoy your Cinnamon Buns! yum</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I ran Live Strat 13x before I got this item. I got it a week after the patch. I found out that it was a white item after my 10th run. <br /><br />If you really want it, just run it as much as you can. You can make good money in Live, why not?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ppl asking money for this are hypocrits tbh<br />most ppl demand/expect mages to make food/water for free..mostly they dont even ask nice either.<br /><br />if u do expect it for free why on earth do u expect a mage to pay 220g for it like someone mentioned earlier..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My mage guildie was trying to get this for a pretty long time now and did many runs. Did two scarlet runs in a row today myself and it dropped on the second run, I guess I bring luck, several orbs dropped as well :P<br /><br />Will be nice for BWL and Naxx breaks =P<br /><br />From archivist btw, but I guess everyone knows that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok everyone seems a little confused about this so im going to clarify... i am a 60 mage, and i have revered with argent dawn. I got this tome on my first drop off archivist in scarlet strat, tho apparantely its a pretty rare drop rate. It is a white drop, no quest needed, and i VERY MUCH DOUBT that reputation has anything to do with it, especially since im only revered. I am currently the only mage with this food so far, so i get like 20 trades to make food every raid now lol, pretty cool. I love cinnamon rolls :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My surefire way to get people out of my mage hair who want food is to hit my macro that says, &quot;Quoi? Desole. Je ne parle pas l'anglias.&quot; then respond with various phrases in French. &quot;Je suis un petit vachon!&quot; or &quot;Ou est la charcuterie?&quot; I suppose other languages would work as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it took me 30 runs to get this until it finally appeared</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We also do DPS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Id like to know what class this kid plays, so I can say a sadic &amp; ignorant comment like his:<br /><br />Sadic &amp; ignorant comment would be like this<br /><br />Mages only do that? oh well, _______ only do...<br /><br />Rogues: DPS<br />Warrior: Tank (yep, only that)<br />Priests: Healx0r<br />Paladins: Blessing &amp; DI<br />Druids: Healx0r<br />Warlocks: DOTs<br />Shamans: Totems &amp; Reincarnate<br />!@#$%^&amp;s: DPS<br /><br />If im missing a class sorry, im too ignorant to know them all.<br /><br />PS. Im a Mage, and have been running Sc Strath for a while (yeah no book), I dont even tell to my party members theres a book I want, I just tell them to &quot;check the body&quot;, tough, If any class would take this and refuse to give to me, I would just hearth and let them 4man the dreadlord or wait around 30mins for a reemplacement and maybe respawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When I went through strat and got this, i didn't see it at first.&nbsp; Everyone in the group has to check the body first, then you will be able to see it, if it's there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So, I went farming for this fancy book (mmmm ... can't say no to cinnamon rolls).<br /><br />Needless to say, my runs stopped when I finally found this book ... and Balnazzar had already dropped -two- Truefaith Vestment patterns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It dropped and it is now blue and not white. We all rolled greed and I (60 UD rogue) won. It made my day</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>According to a prior post, patch 1.12 changed it to blue with a pretty low drop rate. Way to go Blizztards...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>drop rate is very low!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>third time to kill archivist he dropped the tome for teh cinnamon rolls :P (im only honored wit AD)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You may not get this... If a drop has let's say 25% droprate, like this one. Then you COULD say you get it if you do it 4 times... but that is not correct!<br /><br />Cause the chance for it to drop is 25% of 100%... Let's make a scale to make it easier...<br /><br />&lt;---------------------------------------------------&gt;<br />0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 75&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br /><br />Then you got this area:<br /><br /><b>&lt;------------</b>---------------------------------------&gt;<br />0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 75&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br /><br />that is your chance... Se it as a roll! If you roll a dice with 1 to 100, it will maybe happens to be somewhere between 1-25 first shot... Or maybe not! It may become other numbers like... up to 100 times or even more! It's just where the dice lands... So even if a item got 99% drop rate, it's still a chance you won't get it!<br /><br />The % does not add up... like 25+25+25+25=100...<br /><br />If you don't get it, don't blame it on the droprate... It's just your crappy luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is now blue and everyone can roll on it (no mages in our team, greed roll). So at least you can't miss it now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>some idiots sell it for afew hundred gold on our server ! mazrigos</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was on 8 rn but nothing it was FFA most of the times or everybody checked the body ...but nothing so not realy 100%:-(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got mine on first run tonight...<br /><br /> It drops off Archivist Galford in statholme living side, he is usally the last named mob you fight before the last guy. It didn't show up in the loot table so I just checked the corpse since I was the person de'ing things. And there is was...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's a blue drop now. I was running strat with my druid last night and this dropped. We didn't have a mage though, thanfully, and I won the roll. Good thing I have a 60 mage to take advantage of this. Was the 2nd run I've made since the patch and I was surprised to see this drop. I had forgotten about mages even getting a new rank of conjure food.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>He droped Tome of Conjure Food VII for my mage on the 2nd kill. Its white &amp; boe, so make sure u check his corpse yourself. I dont think anyone except mage can see it until u release loot from the body.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Real easy to ninja if people in the group aren't looking for this. It's white so it doesn't get attention very easily on the chat log, and never gets rolled on by the loot system. Dropped on my very 1st run, I looted it and nobody else mentioned it the whole time. Luckily we didn't have any mages.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>why will anyone buy this tome ? u can train the same spell from you mage trainer for 3g40s ... <br /><br />i already done that ... why would anyone wanna buy this tome... i understand arcane brilliance coz thats the group version of our arcane intellect spells so saves time casting on each group member but why this ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got this first run in strat.<br />they looted the corpse so I didnt look at it anymore since there where not glowing stars above it, someone in the group says, Apie loot the corpse, and there it was :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>killed the archivist with two mages in group... none could loot it @ first kill... :-/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Worst...droprate..ever. It's becoming pointless to try to get it anymore. What the hell was blizzard thinking...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone know where this can be obtained?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes! I got mine last night from the Archivist in Scarlet Strat. It's prolly a static drop because it is white.<br /><br />Enjoy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Stats are (from memory) 3160 health over 30 seconds.<br /><br />Just to help with figuring out how this drop works I'll post my experience. Last night I did the run on my mage with a PUG. It was on group loot for the kill. I asked everyone to loot the corpse. After doing so, the druid traded me the book. <br /><br />Later on in the day, I went on my priest with 2 other guild mages (who both needed the book). We put it on Free-for-all on Archivist. We all checked the corpse, first before looting the orb/bluees, and then after the corpse was cleared. No tome. <br /><br />So this is definitely not a 100% drop rate. Anyone in the group can see it and pick it up. (based on druid picking it up and giving it to me)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Selling this for it's median price (60g) on Scarshield Legion (eu) server. /w or mail Annda in game and i will cod it to you if Alliance, or contact me here if you are horde and i will list it on AH on Booty Bay</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hah. People are selling this for a bit north of 200 gold. %^&amp;* that. If you want me to conjure food for you(which I basically never use myself), I'm sure as hell not going to pay hundreds of gold for the &quot;honor&quot; of giving you better food.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Went on a few strat live runs... the first time it didn't drop, second time it did but there were no mages around, so I looted it since it didn't show up on the roll table.<br /><br />Made 100g when I sold it in IF to a raiding mage! Sweet!</div>
