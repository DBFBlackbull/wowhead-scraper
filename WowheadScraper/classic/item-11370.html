You have mining as a skill and also blacksmithing (Weaponsmithing\/Armorsmithing doesnt matter which). You want to start gathering Dark Iron Ore. \n\nA few notes about the ore itself: \n1a. Blacrock Depths and Molten Core are the ONLY instances in the game in which it can be gathered.\n1b. Searing Gorge and burning steppes (after old patch now) \n2. The ore deposits will show up on you're minimap just as any other ore will. \n3. You need to have mining skilled up to at least 230 to mine (heirgo smelt) the ore. \n\nBlackrock depths is special because dark iron ore is completely bound to it. To smelt it you need to give 20 Gold Bars, 2 Star Rubies and 10 Truesilver bars to Gloom'rel in the 7 ghosts room, then you fight 7 elites and he will teach you how to smelt it. \n\nGreat so now you know how to break the ore down into bars, only there are a few problems: \n\n1. To make one bar of dark iron you need 8 dark iron ore. \n2. You need to smelt it at the black forge, located close to the Molten Core raid instance deep within BRD. \n\nTo make Dark Iron items with you bars requires dark iron plans that either: \n1.Drop randomly in BRD, or... \n2.Can be bought from Lokthos Darkbargainer once you attain exalted with the Thorium Brotherhood. \n\nTo make said Dark Iron items requires you to work at the Dark Anvil which is located in the centre of the instance near where Lord Incendius spawns. \n\nAll that being said: HAVE FUN.","date":"2006-07-16T06:37:03-05:00","rating":84,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"albertstoop","importedSubject":"Everything You Ever Needed to Know About Dark Iron"},{"commentv2":1,"number":18,"id":2710300,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"How much rep does a stack of 10 Dark Iron Ore give you if you turn it in to buddy at the bar?","date":"2006-08-21T18:37:03-05:00","rating":-6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"50 reputation for 10 Dark Iron Ore.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Do you need to be Exalted or no to forge them ! Yes or No ? really need to know plz !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>no, you dont need be exalted with the T-Bro (yeah, they gangsta) to LEARN to smelt Dark Iron Ore into Dark Iron Bars.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>by ArtisanPfft<br /><br />OK, lets say you've never looked at Dark Iron Ore before. You have mining as a skill and also blacksmithing (Weaponsmithing/Armorsmithing doesnt matter which). You want to start gathering Dark Iron Ore. <br /><br />A few notes about the ore itself: <br />1a. Blacrock Depths and Molten Core are the ONLY instances in the game in which it can be gathered.<br />1b. Searing Gorge and burning steppes (after old patch now) <br />2. The ore deposits will show up on you're minimap just as any other ore will. <br />3. You need to have mining skilled up to at least 230 to mine (heirgo smelt) the ore. <br /><br />Blackrock depths is special because dark iron ore is completely bound to it. To smelt it you need to give 20 Gold Bars, 2 Star Rubies and 10 Truesilver bars to Gloom'rel in the 7 ghosts room, then you fight 7 elites and he will teach you how to smelt it. <br /><br />Great so now you know how to break the ore down into bars, only there are a few problems: <br /><br />1. To make one bar of dark iron you need 8 dark iron ore. <br />2. You need to smelt it at the black forge, located close to the Molten Core raid instance deep within BRD. <br /><br />To make Dark Iron items with you bars requires dark iron plans that either: <br />1.Drop randomly in BRD, or... <br />2.Can be bought from Lokthos Darkbargainer once you attain exalted with the Thorium Brotherhood. <br /><br />To make said Dark Iron items requires you to work at the Dark Anvil which is located in the centre of the instance near where Lord Incendius spawns. <br /><br />All that being said: HAVE FUN.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there's an isnalnd in feralas (southern island/bigger one) that has a cave, shalzuru's cave (on the northern shore of the island) or smth where there is a underwater passage to another part of the cave where u can find dark iron, mithril, truesilver, rich thorium, iron and silver ore. u need a key to searing gorge (gained with a quest) to enter or u can squeeze through a crack in the wall or if u r a rogue u can pick the lock of the gate to obtain access to that cave. just go there and mine as much as u need or want. there r some lvl 40+ worms, that shouldn't be a problem, u have to pass.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I regularly collect Dark Ore in the Burning Steppes as well and find nodes more frequently there than in Searing Gorge.<br /><br />To Turn them into bars you need to take the to the Black Rock Depths :<br /><br />Speak with Gloom'Rel, who stands on the right side of the room of the seven dwarven spirits. This room is near the end of the instance, and takes quite a while to reach. Gloom'Rel will demand a tribute in order to teach the art of smelting Dark Iron. NOTE: Make sure you speak with Gloom'Rel before speaking with Doom'Rel or any other of the dwarven spirits. Once you start the battle sequence by speaking with Doom'Rel, you can't go back to Gloom'Rel and learn your smelting. <br /><br />Place the tribute items into the Spectral Chalice that appears next to Gloom'Rel after you speak with him. You may need to speak with Gloom'Rel again after you offer your tribute; I don't recall. You now know how to smelt Dark Iron! <br /><br /><b>*Tribute Items*<br />- 2 Star Ruby <br />- 10 Truesilver Bar <br />- 20 Gold Bar</b><br /><br />Smelt your Dark Iron at the Black Forge. As you exit the room of the seven dwarven spirits, turn right, and you will be facing the bridge to Molten Core. Just prior to the bridge is a path to the left, leading up to a waterfall of lava, in the midst of which is the Black Forge. NOTE: It takes 8 Dark Iron Ore to create 1 Dark Iron Bar, so bring everything you've got!</div>
