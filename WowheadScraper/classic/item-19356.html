The answer is zero, that enhancement dosen't exist. On the other hand, there are several weapons with +healing, which in most cases give a higher bonus then dmg\/healing ones.\n\nThe whole reason for the dmg\/healing effect is that it applies to all schools of magic, not so classes that can do both can \"put it to best use\". That's why, for example, mage specific armor has the dmg\/healing effect; it applies to all of their spells.\n\nSo, when you look at it from this point of view then, yes, it does benenfit all casters. But since this is raid drop, nobody in your guild is going to care if you can take advantage of both the healing and the damage bonus, they're going to do what's best for the guild.\n\nIf your a priest, you heal in raids, and you have a class staff that gives over +100 to healing. If your a druid, you heal in raids, and there are maces in MC and BWL that give +healing which you will likely be given the sole rights to, with the exception of paladins\/shamans possibly bidding as well.\n\nThat leaves mages and warlocks. Weapons with dmg\/healing are the only ones they can put to use and since they have spells like shadowbolt, frostbolt, fireball they get the full bonus from the enhancement. \n\nThis is how my guild handles drops with +dmg\/healing. It always goes to mages and warlocks first (both have equal rights). If a priest or druid wants an item with this stat, they are both next in line since they can get better items for their raid role and its obvious they would only want this for pvp.\n\nSorry for the rant, but I was just tired of priest and druids posting claims to weapons with this stat because they \"put it to best use\" or \"omg mages\/warlocks can't heal\".","date":"2005-11-20T22:33:21-06:00","rating":53,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"no need to apologize, u said a lot of things that needed to be said.

This is a caster staff.  Thus casters should use it.  I'm not saying to let the priest roll need on it unless he's shadow, but still, it is a caster staff.\n\nI'm a priest myself, not shadow, but I'm discipline.  I'm kind of upset that people would talk that way about the people who actually decide to heal instead of do damage.  I love this staff.  My priest will be going to BWL in the next month or so, and I hope to God that this staff will drop.  But I know I won't be the only caster in the group of 40.  But I'll run BWL over and over again, letting people get it until I do, or if my guild decides for me to.\n\nBut this staff works for everyone.  I'm a crit healer. In a way, it makes it almost impossible for non-protection warriors to hold aggro when 1 out of 5 heals is a crit, not counting Prayer of Healing and the such.  I even use Power Infusion to power it up more.  I love doing damage, and one way or another, everyone wants to do damage with their class.\n\nRight now I have a 14% chance to crit on my healing or damage spells, and that's not counting my armor or weapons.  I'm pretty powerful with my casting, whether it's healing or damage. So don't say this is not made for all classes.  They didn't put \"Classes: Mage, Warlock\" on the staff.

Whether I was druid, mage, priest, or warlock. I am in fact a warlock though. I do have to point one thing out though. I see posts over and over again about dam\/heal items. I don't get what the fuss is all about. To think that healing classes think that they are being limited because most people do not want to let them roll on dam\/heal items is insane. First of all... You are not being limited. In fact it is the very opposite. Warlocks have healing spells too. Should I be allowed to roll on say the Boots of Pure Thought or the Pure Elementium Band? Both of these are useable by me and have +62 and +53 healing respectivly. Even though I can use them and would benifit from them (Hey when farming I heal my voidwalker), I never expect, nor want them. Why? They are an upgrade from what I've got? Because they are more usefull to another class. In fact lets not even say they are more usefull. Lets say that they are far far more uber to another class. Cause lets face it. A priest is gonna love having the best healing rings or whatever far more than I will. This staff you are arguing about is not the best for your class. Blizzard made far better +healing gear than they did +damage gear. You are not getting screwed out of a bad ass staff. You have much better. We don't. To a mage or warlock this is it. This staff is the shizzle, bizzle, wtfomgpwn! We can't get any better than this. So I'm tired of hearing about \"Well I wanna roll on the staff cause it has healing on it.\" Go get your own best weapon. There are plenty of maces and other gear that we just give you. Hey hunters can heal their pets can't they. Lets let them take that great heal gear... I'm not even gonna comment on the critical strike portion of this staff as even without the crit strike it would still be a mage\/warlocks loot.

However, consider the following: This is +dmg and healing not just healing, there are better healing staves in AQ (namely the Qiraji Augur Staff +143 healing) or you can just get Benediction if you are a priest.  Therefore, healers should not get priority on this staff.  Shamans by end game will be using shields (most likely the Wormscale Blocker +35 healing) as well as a good healer mace (most likely Lok'amir il Romathis mace from Nefarian +84 healing or the Hammer of the Gathering Storm +53 healing) in those cases you heal better and have better tanking capability, though in truth you wont be tanking much (hopefully not at all).  Warlocks we benefit more from a +stam staff, like the Headmaster's Charge from Scholomance, though it will probably never drop, or some other staff with high Stamina.  For Druids it would be better to go for the staves I mentioned for priests who don’t go for Benediction, of course if you are really lucky you might be able to get the Staff of Rampant Growth from one of the world dragons.  In any case this is truly more of a mage staff, the +crit is what mages shoot for in the end (far more so then any other class) and the high dmg would suit them.  After all, mages are a direct dmg class, warlocks are a DoT class, priests are healers (if you are shadow in a raid you might as well just not come), most druids I know use maces in the end rather then staves unless they can get a great epic healer staff, and for shamans, well you aren’t a ranged dps class (yes you can do it, but it isn’t your job) go for a good shield and mace over this, you’ll like it better.","date":"2006-06-29T06:34:13-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Copperblock","importedSubject":"Mage then Warlock, possibly Druid or Shaman"},{"commentv2":1,"number":91,"id":3075206,"nreplies":4,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"ok you pack of idiots here are BETTER staffs then this one FOR MAGES\/LOCKS....\n\nBlessed Qiraji Acolyte Staff\nBinds when picked up\nUnique\nTwo-Hand\tStaff\n132 - 227 Damage\tSpeed 3.00\n(59.8 damage per second)\n+33 Intellect\n+32 Stamina\nRequires Level 60\nEquip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 76. \nEquip: Improves your chance to hit with spells by 2%. \nEquip: Improves your chance to get a critical strike with spells by 1%. \n\"The weapon is infused and reinforced with Elementium.\"\n[item=21273] of Dominance\nBinds when picked up\nTwo-Hand\tStaff\n126 - 205 Damage\tSpeed 2.90\n(57.1 damage per second)\n+37 Intellect\n+16 Stamina\n+14 Spirit\nRequires Level 60\nEquip: Improves your chance to get a critical strike with spells by 1%. \nEquip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 40.\n[item=18842] Wing Focus Staff\nBinds when picked up\nTwo-Hand\tStaff\n142 - 237 Damage\tSpeed 3.20\n(59.2 damage per second)\n+40 Intellect\n+22 Stamina\n+17 Spirit\nRequires Level 60\nEquip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 56. \n[item=19355] one more person comes on here and says this staff is the only mage\/lock item i willl Hunt you down....like there are more then 1 item in this god damn game you pack of crying little kids. now im pist becouse you ppl will not lissing will not  bother to look or *THINK*.

Rings and offhands are OBVIOUSLY any caster class, because they benefit all caster classes.\n\n\n\"ZOMG WATE APRUDO YOU'RE MAKING YOURSELF OUT TO BE AN IDIOT BECUZ U R CONTRADICTING URSELF ROFLMFAO!11!\"\n\nShut the hell up.  A STAFF MAGE OR LOCK has NO (0) BETTER WEAPON IN THIS GAME.  Whoever linked all those staves up there, if you look at the staves, the only one COMPARABLE to this staff is the Acolyte staff.  Now, if you wanna farm the drops out of AQ and go ahead and get that staff, be my guest.  But if another priest says this is a Priest staff, I will \"hunt you\".  BENEDICTION BENEDICTION BENEDICTION.  Why are priests doing DPS anyway? You chose the path of a HEALER.  Heal, get your +Healing gear, heal better, and shut the hell up.  If you wanna be a DPS priest, and you've downed Nefarian, you guys must carry about 12 priests around just to handle it all.  If you wanted to DPS, why did you roll a priest? They can't DPS for beans compared to Mages or Locks.  A DPS priest is simply another aggro grabber and has no space in any kind of endgame.  It's like a waste of a 60.  I tell my guildie priests all the time I have the utmost respect for them getting their toons to 60 and dealing with all the #$%^ priests have to deal with, because I have a priest; and it was a $%^&* to get him anywhere.  Now, that being said, when they made that priest, they KNEW they were making a HEALER class.  If you just look at the class description, it's full of things about HEALING.  There are at least three (3) better healing staves in this game, so go get those and leave us DPS casters alone.\n\nNow, to the Locks, the rift is marginal.  Honestly, if a Lock rolled his DKP on this with a mage, they wouldn't get told no if they won it.  That's not the message I was trying to send.  I know FULL well of Lock capabilities, trust me.  The reason behind what I said is although Locks have a few spells comparable to mages, mages do have three bolt spells, two nukes, two high damage AoEs, and one medium damage nuke AoE.  Granted, the last one has little if any impact on raids whatsoever, but overall, a mage's spellbook in regards to instant DPS just barely outspans the Lock, and that's why this staff just barely suits a mage first.  Not necessarily any better FOR the mage, but he gets marginal priority.  I meant no disrespect to locks reading up on the staff, they do deserve just as much as every mage...I did, however, mean to hammer into people who think this is a priest staff.  That is absolutely mind boggling.","date":"2006-07-16T22:29:29-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"[b]Oopsies!

To even suggest that this staff should be rolled on by all casters is outrageous.  What needs to be said to priests and druids has already been said by everyone who had the sense to link some much better +healing staves.  This staff is the absolute pinnacle for a staff mage or lock.  There are no better staves in the entire game (save for the legendary staff, but no one has a clue what the stats are on that).  I'm a mage, and I have the staff.  My guild gives this staff priority to the mages first, and then the locks.  No one else.  All three times the staff has dropped for us it has gone to mages, with healers not even mentioning a roll.  It's just plain understood that the healing on this staff is subpar to AQ staves and the like.  If a healer in my guild even tried to roll on this, they'd probably get a -25 DKP just for being a complete idiot.\n\nIf you're wondering why mages have the edge over locks, it's simply because instant, direct DPS has a slight edge over DOTs.  Really, if you think about it, locks have 3 crucial roles:  Garr, Drakonid zerg before Nefarian, and Onyxia phase 2.  Any other fight you could put a mage in every locks place and do just as good, if not better.  If you switch it around, however, and put a lock in every mage's place, the fight would go MUCH slower, and a lot of healing mana would be totally gone.  \n\nReally people, Healer gear?

The only weapon that is comparable to this one is the Blessed Qiraji Acolyte Staff from regalia turnin in AQ40, but it requires killing the Twin Emperors and clearing the trash to C'Thun, as opposed to the Staff of the Shadow Flame being a drop from Nefarian in BWL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ravus</b></h3>This is really the only weapon worth getting for pure dps caster pre-AQ ( Blessed Qiraji Acolyte Staff / Sharpened Silithid Femur ) and certainly the only one from BWL. <br /><br />Sadly the drop rate really is that low, my guild has only had two of them drop in many months of farming nef.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7512</b></h3>The only weapon you with see comparable to this pre-Naxxramas is the Blessed Qiraji Acolyte Staff, the quest item for which is another low drop rate off AQ bosses. When presented the opportunity, reguardless of class, I suggest casters pick up this weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7601</b></h3>I am very pleased with this staff. Sadly it does have a very low drop rate but I was lucky (and smart) enough for this to drop on my guild's first Nefarian kill, and having hoarded up enough DKP to snag it with no questions &gt;=D. Slap a spell power enchant on this baby and get to work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8356</b></h3>With the drop rate so low, a more feasible choice to strive for is the Master Dragonslayer's Orb, and pick up a Grand Marshal's Mageblade in a few days of PVPing. Nef's head is a 100% drop that yields the Orb and the GM Mageblade is only 22,500 honor. You gain 16 spell damage at the cost of 7 int and 1% crit going with the Orb/GM Mageblade combo, but its much easier to attain. If you have the chance to get the staff, go for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>anyone who really raids places like this knows that it really doesnt matter what you think about who should get this staff, it's going to go to the person who spends the points on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why argue and waste tons of time and readers time posting crap?<br /><br />Simple, the Guild will most likely tell you who can&nbsp; bid for this (oh for those of you who don't know, its bidding not rolling in end game instances).&nbsp; As a priest I would love this but know mostly likely than not I'm third priority on this staff.&nbsp; Just because locks and mages can't get staffs anywhere near as good as us priest can with benedection.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said if you are in a guild that runs BWL and successfully, don't worry you'll get your staff soon enough.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For all the posts I see of priests and druids claiming MC/BWL drops with this bonus on it,&nbsp; since they think they put it to the ultimate use, I'd like to clear something up for you.<br /><br />Do you know how many weapons have +dmg to spells? The answer is zero, that enhancement dosen't exist. On the other hand, there are several weapons with +healing, which in most cases give a higher bonus then dmg/healing ones.<br /><br />The whole reason for the dmg/healing effect is that it applies to all schools of magic, not so classes that can do both can &quot;put it to best use&quot;. That's why, for example, mage specific armor has the dmg/healing effect; it applies to all of their spells.<br /><br />So, when you look at it from this point of view then, yes, it does benenfit all casters. But since this is raid drop, nobody in your guild is going to care if you can take advantage of both the healing and the damage bonus, they're going to do what's best for the guild.<br /><br />If your a priest, you heal in raids, and you have a class staff that gives over +100 to healing. If your a druid, you heal in raids, and there are maces in MC and BWL that give +healing which you will likely be given the sole rights to, with the exception of paladins/shamans possibly bidding as well.<br /><br />That leaves mages and warlocks. Weapons with dmg/healing are the only ones they can put to use and since they have spells like shadowbolt, frostbolt, fireball they get the full bonus from the enhancement. <br /><br />This is how my guild handles drops with +dmg/healing. It always goes to mages and warlocks first (both have equal rights). If a priest or druid wants an item with this stat, they are both next in line since they can get better items for their raid role and its obvious they would only want this for pvp.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant, but I was just tired of priest and druids posting claims to weapons with this stat because they &quot;put it to best use&quot; or &quot;omg mages/warlocks can't heal&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can someone please show me an epic staff that has stamina as its primary attribute?&nbsp; I dont think one exists.....at least not that has any decent chance to crit and spell damage withit.<br /><br />Also to the argument that when we life tap we waste the Priests mana...thats true, but I have over 6000 health and 7000 mana as a warlock, I could be wrong but I can lifetap 848 health and get 1018 mana back,&nbsp; that leaves me with 5152 health and the equivelent of 8018 mana. At 5152 health, I still have more than a mage....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>qazws threw down in all areas on this one. Props.<br /><br />Here's how our guild works it ATM.<br /><br />With our DKP system anyone with the DKP can roll on this staff as long as they can hold it in their hands.<br /><br />However we do URGE people to think hard before trying to roll on something that would benefit another class much more.<br /><br />For instance we have a few Warriors that would love the Blastershot Launcher.&nbsp; But when the bidding comes around they don't roll because we have hunters attending raids who still want it.&nbsp; They know once all our hunters get the leaf that they will get one if they spend the DKP.<br /><br />We rarely have much in the way of arguments over this kind of stuff as we are all pretty decent people and anyone that said something like this:<br /><br />&quot;Hunter weapon because they get the most use from it&quot;<br /><br />They would just get laughed at because everyone would think it was a joke.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As my holy Priest, My Benediction increases healing power by 106, and other stats are as good as this staff.<br /><br />Therefore, it's not necessary for a priest to roll for it. <br /><br />But if i get it, i will definitely unlearn my telent and become a shadow priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got a lvl 60 resto druid, and tho i would love this staff, i think its much more powerful in the hands of a mage or warlock. the high INT and +2% crit isnt meant for healing, cause critical heals have a high threat, and are unnessesary. erm a moonkin druid.....they better be the best damn moonkin druid on the server to get a stab at this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The yellow glow on the staff is from the +22 int buff.&nbsp; The staff itself doesn't have an aura.<br /><br /><a href="http://photobucket.com/albums/f220/calambaster/th_e784b50f.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photobucket.com/albums/f220/calambaster/th_e784b50f.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://photobucket.com/albums/f220/calambaster/th_89c089ac.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photobucket.com/albums/f220/calambaster/th_89c089ac.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>HHm, I just got this staff on just the 2nd nef kill of my guild. It cost 135 hrs raiding time to get it ( in dkp), in the end i was bidding against a druid.<br /><br />Now i have mixed feelings about this( being a mage), on one hand i do think people with dkp deserve to spend it on whatever they want, on the other hand certain items are much better for some classes over the other. <br /><br />Now for a mage/lock, you simply cannot get a better item for your wep slot than this staff. All other classes can get relatively the same benefits with other items on the same slot. So i would think long and hard before bidding on this. In the end it comes down to your guildmates letting you have this, and no matter your class, if you deserve it, you will get it sooner or later.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Put it this way, out of clear caster drops:<br /><br /><u>What can a Lock/Mage roll on as a weapon in BWL:</u><br /><br />Shadow Wing Focus Staff&nbsp; - Drakes - (Staff)<br />Claw of Chromaggus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Chrom - (Dagger)<br />Staff of the shadow flame&nbsp; - Nef -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Staff)<br /><br /><u>Now what can Priests/Druids roll on:</u><br /><br />Shadow Wing Focus staff&nbsp; - Drakes -&nbsp; (Staff)<br />Claw of Chromaggus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Chrom -&nbsp; (Dagger)<br />Staff of the shadow flame&nbsp; &nbsp; - Nef -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Staff)<br />Lok'amir il Romathis&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Nef -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Mace)<br /><br /><u>And ofc Pally's</u><br /><br />Lok'amir il Romathis&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Nef -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Mace)<br />Herald of Woe&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Flamegor - (2H mace)<br />(Plus DPS weapons)<br /><br />Now if you look at all that, there are many overlaps, so there will always be contention. However, I do wonder why Druids and Priests would not rather take Lok'amir il Romathis over the staff of the shadow flame. The mace has the same Dam/heal as the staff, and you can also have you choice of healing/dam/stats offhand. If this staff dropped for my Druid, I myself wouldn't deny the locks and mages what little choice they have considering that mace is out there. Ok you loose 2% crit, but you gain whatever's on your offhand. Just take a look as some of these:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thotbott.com/?i=51904" rel="nofollow">Master Dragonslayer's Orb</a><br /><a href="http://www.thotbott.com/?i=53099" rel="nofollow">Royal Scepter of Vek'lor</a><br /><a href="http://www.thotbott.com/?i=40571" rel="nofollow">Lei of the Lifegiver</a><br /><a href="http://www.thotbott.com/?i=52891" rel="nofollow">Sartura's Might</a><br /><a href="http://www.thotbott.com/?i=52641" rel="nofollow">Talon of Furious Concentration</a><br /><br />So before you go racing off rolling on the first thing that drops, look around a little to see what's available, and I think you'll find those poor Mages and Locks are reduced to tears when they see Druids/Priests with the Staff of the shadow Flame. Give me Lok'amir il Romathis any day.</div>

That means you'll get one of these about every five months, if you take Nefarian down every week, AND if you're in average luck. <br /><br />Thinking it further, you can end up going on for two years without a single one of these dropping. (Just think of the quests that you've probably done too, where drop rate of objective item is &lt;5% from some type of monster. You might end up killing A LOT of them before it drops.)<br /><br />Point being: Don't look forward into getting this (or any other really low drop rate item!) too early on. You might end up really disappointed, when others are getting sets and other weapons from Ahn'Qiraj, Blackwing Lair etc. and you're just saving points, waiting.. and waiting... and waiting.<br /><br />15 weeks of Nefarian for my guild now, no drop yet. But damn, it'll be a bomb when it drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have a 60 priest and would honestly give priority to a Mage or Warlock for this item.&nbsp; While <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=51940">Staff of the Shadow Flame</a> is better than <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=38169">Anathema</a> for Shadow Priest PvP, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37916">Benediction</a> is better for healing, plain and simple.<br /><br />My point is this: Mages and Warlocks would use this item as a primary weapon while Priests would ONLY use it as a secondary PvP weapon, opting instead for Benediction when healing (considering the +heal is greater by 22, Intellect is increased by 2 and you still recieve the +2% crit chance on holy spells).&nbsp; Therefore, in my humble opinion, it shouldn't go to a class that would let it sit in their bags for even a moment.&nbsp; A pure damage class could make FAR greater use out of it considering the options available to the primary healing class(es).&nbsp; Yes, I believe this goes for the Druids out there too.<br /><br />Again, this is simply my view as a Priest knowing what I know about the weapons available to my class.&nbsp; Congratulations to anyone who recieves this, it is an excellent addition to any caster's collection.</div>

Staff has more stats and 2% crit but lacks 16 spell damage, but I think it is a bit better than claw + tome.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Warlocks and Mages can't use Lok'amir il Romanthis <a href="/classic/item=19360/lokamir-il-romathis">Lok'amir il Romathis</a> more about avaliability of good damage items than anything. Get that mace + a decent offhand and you have a combo that can do more damage than this staff. To me, it's not even a question of &quot;is Staff of the Shadowflame better than Benediction?&quot; or &quot;Mages and Warlocks DPS more therefore they should get this item, right?&quot;<br /><br />All classes have the right to go for DMG items, but don't let your greed get in the way of seeing certain restrictions. My guild hopes that people can see what options they have, versus what options other classes have. Mages and Warlocks can use Claw of Chromaggus, yeah that's true... but that item isn't on the same level as Nefarian's drops.<br /><br />So if you believe that as a Priest, Druid, or Shaman, that you deserve this Staff as much as a Mage or Warlock, remember that they don't have two weapons they can use for DPS off Nefarian, only one.<br /><br />Either way, if you get this staff, congratulations, because it's very, very rare. Make sure you don't put it to shame by not enchanting it :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't see how this is a warlock staff over a mage staff...<br /><br />Because of the sta? Mages especially need sta in their non set items more than warlocks, because we don't get a natural bonus to it with our set unlike warlocks, and it's important to have a lot of stamina in many of the BWL fights. <br /><br />It's great for either class. As for the other classes, well they generally have better options, such as benediction or the mace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't know, this thing seems to be a great balance for all casters that can use it. Warlocks and mages will drool over this because it has the highest +damage of any staff that I've seen so far, but because all magic school-inspecific +damage stats include healing, this would also be decent for a healer. I think the only problem with giving this to a healer is that the Staff of Rampant Growth is arguably the best non-classed healer staff in the game. If you are a guild that goes by DKP, please don't put priority on classes, anyone that can use it will want this thing, outside of priests that have Benediction already. Also, for priests that don't have Benediction, I would highly suggest that you do try to get it. EoS is easy to come by now, EoD is about 50% on Domo (if you can get to Nef there's no way in hell you can't beat Domo), and in the long run it'll last you longer.<br /><br />Crits do matter to me as a druid, I love the 50%+ crit of Regrowth, and every bit of crit loving I can get, I try to hold on to until +healing upgrades become more important. Couple downsides to that is Regrowth contributes to overhealing and crits pull aggro faster.<br /><br />I would say that any DD caster or any healer that can equip staves that consider this an upgrade should have an equal shot at it. Myself, I wouldn't take it as a druid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Its funny everyone is arguing over a staff that 95% of the people will never see drop. Now quit pigon holeing druids, havent you ever heard of balanced spec. This is a great staff for a balanced druid. Not only would it help them when they have to fill the healing roll but they will be able to nuke with it in moonkin form. And Before you say &quot;no guild runs BWL with moonkins&quot; My guild runs BWL with 2 moonkins the warlocks and mages love the +3% crit they get with them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Of course this is a mage/lock staff. Priests got Anathema/Benediction which is at leat equaly as good or even better in some cases (more + healing on Benediction).<br /><br />But all sensible people know this. Only a real twat would consider giving this to a Priest over mage/lock.<br /><br />This is also backed up by the fact that I have never seen a priest or druid, or in fact a picture of one, with this staff. Only mages and locks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wait, healing too? To say that ONLY mages and warlocks get this is stupid. Druid in genesis or the ZG armor will eat this up. They have a swiftbuild in balanace that reduces casting time of all spells by .5 sec on spell crit. Including healing.<br /><br />Do mages heal? Nope so... half of the staffs power is wasted because it says crit.<br /><br />Warlocks benefit from the healing I think because of the soul link, tap or whatever that is.<br /><br />Then you look at shamans and druids. The only 2 classes that use staves that can legitamatly heal, take advantage of the crit and cast on offense.<br /><br />Im a druid and im constantly getting the shaft. Mageblade goes to Mages/Warlocks. I was like cool ill get staff of dominance.... NO, Mages and warlocks.<br /><br />Screw you guys, stop being greedy :x</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Petty bickering over classes aside, priests can use Benediction as healers, but priests can also spec shadow or PI and DPS. I've been a holy priest since my first talent point at level 10 (Try grinding a holy priest in the days of retail, it's a pain). I've recently decided to play with PI for a bit, and this staff is one I'm considering. <br /><br />The stats are a direct increase over Benediction and the +healing is comparable. The benefits being that it have +dmg as well, allowing me to DPS and still be a good healer without swapping weapons, which triggers a 1 sec cooldown and could mean a dead tank. The staff also retains the 2% to crit, but it affects all spells and not just holy, making a nice staff for shadow priests, too.<br /><br />Renditis at least right in the sense that the staff is good for all classes. Yes, some classes will probably benefit more from it, like mages and locks, but saying that a priest or druid won't benefit at all is just naïve.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It has a skull on it so it's a warlock item.

Compared to Staff of the Shadow flame, it has +2 hit at the cost of +1 crit and +8dmg.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Like my subject, casters are casters. This is a caster staff. Thus casters should use it. I'm not saying to let the priest roll need on it unless he's shadow, but still, it is a caster staff.<br /><br />I'm a priest myself, not shadow, but I'm discipline. I'm kind of upset that people would talk that way about the people who actually decide to heal instead of do damage. I love this staff. My priest will be going to BWL in the next month or so, and I hope to God that this staff will drop. But I know I won't be the only caster in the group of 40. But I'll run BWL over and over again, letting people get it until I do, or if my guild decides for me to.<br /><br />But this staff works for everyone. I'm a crit healer. In a way, it makes it almost impossible for non-protection warriors to hold aggro when 1 out of 5 heals is a crit, not counting Prayer of Healing and the such. I even use Power Infusion to power it up more. I love doing damage, and one way or another, everyone wants to do damage with their class.<br /><br />Right now I have a 14% chance to crit on my healing or damage spells, and that's not counting my armor or weapons. I'm pretty powerful with my casting, whether it's healing or damage. So don't say this is not made for all classes. They didn't put &quot;Classes: Mage, Warlock&quot; on the staff. Even the Belt of the Archmage (<a href="/classic/item=18405/belt-of-the-archmage">Belt of the Archmage</a> is for all classes compared to the Robe (<a href="/classic/item=14152/robe-of-the-archmage">Robe of the Archmage</a> Blizzard understands that we need our freedom to do whatever we want, so they've let this staff be unrestricted by class for a reason.<br /><br />To let us do insane damage...no matter what caster class we are!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone saying this is a druid/priest staff is most likely not in a guild that downs nefa.<br />Oomkin druids are not wanted in raids, and balance spec is utterly gimped.<br />This is mage/warlock staff, but give it to mages first if they want it, since mages and <u>not</u> warlocks are the primary ranged dps class; warlock is a debuff class and are damage inefficient.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well i decided to make a &quot;Best of Rendit post&quot; because iam bored. anyway i limited it to just the first page, cuz a post bordering on infinity would be unwise on a site like this. Anyway check out the hot stuff he posted.<br /><br />.also besides Looking kick ass it has 29 int ,24stam, 18spir.this staff is GOOD for mage,priest,warlock,druid, maby shaman i dont know if they can use staffs. now ppl that say this is just for 1 class you are 100% stupid and need to learn more about this game and what are good for class's. (ppl need to learn more about the game, but...but... can shammies use staff! (the answer is ofc, yes they can:p)<br /><br />i was being a smart ass about the IQ thing. IQ is rated in points,could also in % alot of things can be used in %.like 130 IQ points could be 100%,just like cuting that in helf would make it 65 IQ points could make it 50%. but sents i was being a smart ass i dont see why it matters. (not even gonna comment on this one, its just too rofl)<br /><br />Rendit... if your guild let healers get this the officers are really stupid :DD <br /><br />theres better staffs for healers than this so................<br /><br />lead to<br />Nutsio you are an idiot i never said in any of my Post's that its a healer only staff. i clearly said this is a good staff for well read my posts lol(he never said u did lawl, he just (as the 58th person) tried to show u that u were/are wrong(hard to say if u have finally realized that this is infact most beneficial for mages/locks and thus should they have priority on it(however i doubt it:p))<br /><br />ok this got boring quite fast, for more funny contradictions and redicule see Rendits posts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well well well, this seems to be a heated argument. Im going to throw in my opinion. Yes there are better staves for healers, but how often are those presented. If this is looted, and a healer has the dkp, its right there, in front of their face instead of just on a wish list. Also I agree this is MUCH better suited in the hands of a mage or lock, but it doesnt mean it ISNT useful in a healers arms either. And we all know how important healers are... they allow you to get far enough to get this staff. So rather then cutting people off from getting an item they can use, let people go for it. Thats like telling the black person that they cant have sunscreen because white people need it more. Also druids have damage spells too so stop refering to them as only healers... if you are wondering Im a mage. And yes I want it, I would kill for it. And if I lost to a healer I would be pissed. But if I lost to ANYONE I would be pissed. Stop being hardasses.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>its nice that everyone is comparing all these staffs and have brought up some nice points. i think we have over looked something.<br /><br />1. guilds dont like shadow priests at this point of the game<br /><br />2. priests HEAL<br /><br />3. mages/locks are primary DPS<br /><br />from my experience in bwl. i have not seen anyone of our priests stop healing to smite nef down. this would suit a lock, a mage, a druid, or a shaman better because they can heal and do damage. and they can switch roles and do good at either. <br /><br />my 2c</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>its mage/warlock priority in most high end guilds, dr00ds are 3rd i assume, the reason? well this is the best for mages/warlocks(togheter with the acolyte from AQ40 quest), and it isnt the best setup for dr00ds, as long as u assume the dr00ds heal in raids, which they always do, unless u have the instance on farm in which case u can let them go feral, LOLOLOL CPDOOM U N00B! WHATS A BETTER SETUP FOR DR00DS THEN!, well lets say u want some +dmg then go with Lok'amir il Romathis and a nice offhand of ur choice, with that u can get more +dmg and better stats. You cant imagine the whine that mages and warlocks have utered cuz lok'amir is a mace and therefore unuseable for us. So plz stay away from SotSF dr00d, tho not many guilds that doesnt have mage/warlock prio on it, and thx god for that=)<br /><br />Edit: and dr00ds dont rly need +spell dmg since they only heal in instances anyway(almost at least). Ofc there exsist a few exceptions, but a dr00ds main job in a raid is to heal and gief innervate ofc=). If u dont recognize this its because u dont know very much about raiding high end instances, and thus will never even get the chance to get this staff=). And if we're talking PvP wise most dr00ds prefer to be feral, and with AQ40 and emerald green dwagons lots of new feral items has been implemented.<br />So i see no probs in this being mage/warlock prio, and moonkin dr00ds can die in a ditch imo.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 27 07:16:12 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay I have to point out that if given the opportunity to have this staff I would take it. Whether I was druid, mage, priest, or warlock. I am in fact a warlock though. I do have to point one thing out though. I see posts over and over again about dam/heal items. I don't get what the fuss is all about. To think that healing classes think that they are being limited because most people do not want to let them roll on dam/heal items is insane. First of all... You are not being limited. In fact it is the very opposite. Warlocks have healing spells too. Should I be allowed to roll on say the Boots of Pure Thought or the Pure Elementium Band? Both of these are useable by me and have +62 and +53 healing respectivly. Even though I can use them and would benifit from them (Hey when farming I heal my voidwalker), I never expect, nor want them. Why? They are an upgrade from what I've got? Because they are more usefull to another class. In fact lets not even say they are more usefull. Lets say that they are far far more uber to another class. Cause lets face it. A priest is gonna love having the best healing rings or whatever far more than I will. This staff you are arguing about is not the best for your class. Blizzard made far better +healing gear than they did +damage gear. You are not getting screwed out of a bad ass staff. You have much better. We don't. To a mage or warlock this is it. This staff is the shizzle, bizzle, wtfomgpwn! We can't get any better than this. So I'm tired of hearing about &quot;Well I wanna roll on the staff cause it has healing on it.&quot; Go get your own best weapon. There are plenty of maces and other gear that we just give you. Hey hunters can heal their pets can't they. Lets let them take that great heal gear... I'm not even gonna comment on the critical strike portion of this staff as even without the crit strike it would still be a mage/warlocks loot. Thank God my guild uses officer loot and I'll never have to hear &quot;Why can't I get that staff?&quot; in my raids. Nuff Said.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a great staff, and I understand why people of many classes want it. However, consider the following: This is +dmg and healing not just healing, there are better healing staves in AQ (namely the Qiraji Augur Staff +143 healing) or you can just get Benediction if you are a priest. Therefore, healers should not get priority on this staff. Shamans by end game will be using shields (most likely the Wormscale Blocker +35 healing) as well as a good healer mace (most likely Lok'amir il Romathis mace from Nefarian +84 healing or the Hammer of the Gathering Storm +53 healing) in those cases you heal better and have better tanking capability, though in truth you wont be tanking much (hopefully not at all). Warlocks we benefit more from a +stam staff, like the Headmaster's Charge from Scholomance, though it will probably never drop, or some other staff with high Stamina. For Druids it would be better to go for the staves I mentioned for priests who don’t go for Benediction, of course if you are really lucky you might be able to get the Staff of Rampant Growth from one of the world dragons. In any case this is truly more of a mage staff, the +crit is what mages shoot for in the end (far more so then any other class) and the high dmg would suit them. After all, mages are a direct dmg class, warlocks are a DoT class, priests are healers (if you are shadow in a raid you might as well just not come), most druids I know use maces in the end rather then staves unless they can get a great epic healer staff, and for shamans, well you aren’t a ranged dps class (yes you can do it, but it isn’t your job) go for a good shield and mace over this, you’ll like it better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OBVIOUSLY MC drops such as the Mageblade and certain offhands/rings can go to any caster class...the last two MC runs we went on two paladins got the mageblade. I never objected to that, after all, paladins do melee damage, and they do cast healing spells. Rings and offhands are OBVIOUSLY any caster class, because they benefit all caster classes.<br /><br />&quot;ZOMG WATE APRUDO YOU'RE MAKING YOURSELF OUT TO BE AN IDIOT BECUZ U R CONTRADICTING URSELF ROFLMFAO!11!&quot;<br /><br />Shut the hell up. A STAFF MAGE OR LOCK has NO (0) BETTER WEAPON IN THIS GAME. Whoever linked all those staves up there, if you look at the staves, the only one COMPARABLE to this staff is the Acolyte staff. Now, if you wanna farm the drops out of AQ and go ahead and get that staff, be my guest. But if another priest says this is a Priest staff, I will &quot;hunt you&quot;. BENEDICTION BENEDICTION BENEDICTION. Why are priests doing DPS anyway? You chose the path of a HEALER. Heal, get your +Healing gear, heal better, and shut the hell up. If you wanna be a DPS priest, and you've downed Nefarian, you guys must carry about 12 priests around just to handle it all. If you wanted to DPS, why did you roll a priest? They can't DPS for beans compared to Mages or Locks. A DPS priest is simply another aggro grabber and has no space in any kind of endgame. It's like a waste of a 60. I tell my guildie priests all the time I have the utmost respect for them getting their toons to 60 and dealing with all the #$%^ priests have to deal with, because I have a priest; and it was a $%^&amp;* to get him anywhere. Now, that being said, when they made that priest, they KNEW they were making a HEALER class. If you just look at the class description, it's full of things about HEALING. There are at least three (3) better healing staves in this game, so go get those and leave us DPS casters alone.<br /><br />Now, to the Locks, the rift is marginal. Honestly, if a Lock rolled his DKP on this with a mage, they wouldn't get told no if they won it. That's not the message I was trying to send. I know FULL well of Lock capabilities, trust me. The reason behind what I said is although Locks have a few spells comparable to mages, mages do have three bolt spells, two nukes, two high damage AoEs, and one medium damage nuke AoE. Granted, the last one has little if any impact on raids whatsoever, but overall, a mage's spellbook in regards to instant DPS just barely outspans the Lock, and that's why this staff just barely suits a mage first. Not necessarily any better FOR the mage, but he gets marginal priority. I meant no disrespect to locks reading up on the staff, they do deserve just as much as every mage...I did, however, mean to hammer into people who think this is a priest staff. That is absolutely mind boggling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Easy answer for who should get this staff, Blizzard designed their Warlock figurine that you can buy from the Blizzard online store holding this staff. I would say it was designed for a warlock. :) (but i'm sure anyone that can have spell damage and/or healing spells would love to have this staff... it is awsome!)<br /><br />Edited, Tue Apr 18 11:13:53 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i agree 100% man, ppl should be able to think what they want. thats what i am doing (I) think its a good caster staff for all caster class's reason i have to keep saying this is becouse i get some idiot saying i think this is druid or priest item when i NEVER said that. i dont know how many times i said i think this should be a staff for all caster class's.i also know that blizz would tell everyone of you the same thing. and if they dont LINK the screen shot or post.it is not just the damage/healing that makes this good for all caster's. has ANYONE even looked at the other stats? +2crit WORKS on all SPELLS damage or healing.i also think its rude for ppl to say that if your not a mage or lock and roll on this you suck and should be kicked from guild that is 100%BS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This debate is rediculous. To even suggest that this staff should be rolled on by all casters is outrageous. What needs to be said to priests and druids has already been said by everyone who had the sense to link some much better +healing staves. This staff is the absolute pinnacle for a staff mage or lock. There are no better staves in the entire game (save for the legendary staff, but no one has a clue what the stats are on that). I'm a mage, and I have the staff. My guild gives this staff priority to the mages first, and then the locks. No one else. All three times the staff has dropped for us it has gone to mages, with healers not even mentioning a roll. It's just plain understood that the healing on this staff is subpar to AQ staves and the like. If a healer in my guild even tried to roll on this, they'd probably get a -25 DKP just for being a complete idiot.<br /><br />If you're wondering why mages have the edge over locks, it's simply because instant, direct DPS has a slight edge over DOTs. Really, if you think about it, locks have 3 crucial roles: Garr, Drakonid zerg before Nefarian, and Onyxia phase 2. Any other fight you could put a mage in every locks place and do just as good, if not better. If you switch it around, however, and put a lock in every mage's place, the fight would go MUCH slower, and a lot of healing mana would be totally gone. <br /><br />Really people, Healer gear? Jesus.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Forget all of them...just give it to the DPS warrior to lvl his staves up and end this long ass post lol. I'm a priest from a guild that raids Nax and a priest has NEVER even been allowed to bid on this and we dont complain because we know our role in a raid. I PvP up to rank 9 and they let me go shadow recently due to having 6 priests, druids, and pallys in raid...so i get to dps and throw shadow weaving up for the locks :) I dont even want this....Priest can use maces! go after Lok'amir il Romathis <a href="/classic/item=19360/lokamir-il-romathis">Lok'amir il Romathis</a> Mages/Locks cant even use this so its just you against pallys/druids. Let this tired post go. Shadow Flame is lock/mage priority end of it. Priest can do dps this it true but we are available to more (maces)just like they can use swords and we can't. From reading the previous posts it is very clear who raids end game and who doesnt. No priest from an end game guild in their right mind would @#$%^ about not being able to bid on this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Rather funny to read all this bull$%^&amp; about druids should get to bid on this staff.<br /><br />There is no chance what so ever a druid would get this over a dmg dealing caster in my guild aka mage/warlock.<br /><br />why? critts as healer = overaggro, you cant just stop healing after a critt, but a dmg dealer can.<br /><br />Dmg dealers whants to increase their DPS, healers should and atleast the ones in my guild, does go for a LONGER LASTING ability, thus they go for mana restore and if they can they put in +healing to.<br /><br />Druids that whants to bid on this staff is just pure epic horny tards.<br /><br />go ahead and flame me for it i dont care.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is so stupid. To all you people arguing over who should get this staff when it drops, I would submit this: it's not up to us, the posters on this forum. It's up to your guild, when the staff drops. So if you're a druid who wants this staff, and your guild insists on only letting mages / locks roll, find another guild. If you're a mage or lock who thinks that the staff should go to those classes who will most benifit the raid by having it, then find a guild that shares your views. Arguing about it here won't change a thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is called <b>Mage/Warlock</b> because if your healing you'd be saving your dkp for <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52191">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52191</a><br />or if they had a guild doing AQ40 and BWL (both) they'd save their dkp for the mats to get this <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52896">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52896</a><br />All of the staffs/daggers/whatever give +Damage and Healing because Blizzard expected some people to be healing and doing some damage, for farming stuff outside of raids. Perfect example of this is an Elemental Mastery/Resto Sham. And beleive it or not, that's actually not all that bad ofa build because usually only Enhancement/Resto (PvP) specced Shams melee. I hope everyone reads this because this argument has been comepletely pointless and bringing up the same topics every 2 posts (i.e. Rendit). Let people think what they want. But this is THE BEST staff so far (haven't seen the Legendary caster item yet) for Mages at least. Pretty sure for Warlocks too. Druids if Resto have one of the above linked staffs to hope for along with Resto Shams and Holy Priests. Some Priests are actually Shadow (o.O) and have downed BWL. Not all Priests heal in raids cause some guilds have perfected the raid. Only Priest I can picture having this is a Shadow Priest. You also usually don't do Need and Greed in end-game cause it's all on ML. ML = Master Looter if you haven't experienced it yet. If you check my character you're probably thinking &quot;WTF This low-level mage can't tell ME this stuff!&quot; I have a 60 Rogue on a different server. Don't feel like logging onto him because I have no use for the server Skullcrusher anymore. To all healers who spend dkp on this, go ahead, but there's better stuff for you to get. This is a long post so I'm gonna stop, I beleive I've gone over everything I felt like saying. Also, if I screwed up spelling on some words and you want to bring it up, you care way too much.<br /><br />Edit: Links were screwed up.<br /><br />Edited, Wed May 24 18:52:20 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is the best staf I have ever seen. This is in my opinion a Warlock/Mage staf only. Priests/Hunters and whatever have other things they can have that not mages and warlocks can use, so first priority goes to mages and warlocks.<br /><br />But then again I would like to straighten some things up. <br />For Mage this staff gives all from 1,8% to 2% extra crit chance. In frost you can increase the crit-extra dmg with 100%. No questions aboute it?<br />In fire therse a talent called Ignite that lights the taret on fire causing 40% of the spell dmg of the critical strice to fall again on the target. (so if you critt 1000 you actualy hits the target for 1400 total dmg). But ofc, the fire still only critts for up to 50% extra dmg (with ignite 90%).<br /><br />Best regards<br />//Cybresia 60 Troll Mage (Anonymous) - Genjuros</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For those saying &quot;its for priests and druids it has +healing!&quot; your idiots...<br /><br />Go find me an epic staff in the game that was straight +damage... cant? because there is none. They put just +healing on staffs for a reason, they're for priests, druids, shammies and possibly pally's.<br /><br />Mage/Lock staff because theres nothing else we can use or even really think of. All mage/lock staves have damage/HEALING. Its clear that a number of you have never been to MC/BWL, the only way you'd get this is if all the other mages/locks had it or passed. next in line would be druid, then shammy/priest then pally.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Jan 6 08:34:16 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>can't decide whether to go for this staff of the quested one that requires an insane amount of luck to obtain. Both have great stats, but this one seems to have 1% more chance to crit an added 8 to spell damage and it has spirit. However the other staff has a little more int and stam plus a 2% chance to hit with spells. Leaning towards Shadow Flame, but I don't know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>While you possibly could get more +damage than this, you wouldn't get any crit chance. For any caster, +2% crit chance is effectively +1% total damage, and for some talent builds it's +2% (Frost mages' frost bolts, for instance).<br /><br />So it would be superior, of course, critting in high-end raid instances isn't always a good thing, there's the issue of aggro to consider.</div>

Mana and crit chance are more relevant than ever before in absence of worldbuffs, and large amount of intellect and spirit push this stick ahead of r14 or aq40 weapons. Your guild would do well to prioritize mages over locks, who won't hesitate to use AQ40 weapons instead.<br /><br />(and give locks one tear for every staff that's given to mages, or something to keep it fair).</div>
