<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Cool. I guess I'll just hold on to these then. Might go farm them some more. I need to at least get Neutral with this guys and evertually friendly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got like 50 feathers in inventory but now I cant cash in rep for them, they only offer me new quest where I kill special number of 3 types !<br /><br />Does this have anything to do with how much rep I got, or is there a cycle where these two quests take change each week for more quest-variety ?<br /><br />Got 1400/6000 rep on my way to being honored atm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i think tyhey took them out this week im not sure&nbsp; last week i farmed them for about 3 hours and got 50 feathers&nbsp; took me to firendly&nbsp; now none will drop at all <br /><br />so either they dont drop at friendly status and they are only to help you get to friendly or they removed them to tweak it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was in Felwood with a friend today, and I was able to collect all the feathers while he couldn't. When he looted he even left feathers for me, because he couldn't see or loot them.<br />But he did already loot them another day. Anyone understand this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The guy by the tunnel now gives a quest to kill near the tunnel.<br /><br />Grazzle is by a tree just south of Emerald Santcuary and gives this quest and they can be gotten off the mobs in Deadwood Village for sure.&nbsp; I cannot confirm if they drop off of the ones in Felpaw Village, but I don't think they will.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to work on faction for the first time last night. I had the kill quest and was in a full group. Every one but me was getting these drops. Then it dawned on me, I ran back to the quest giver, turned in the completed kill quest and these started dropping. <br /><br />It seems you need to complete the first kill quest in order to start these dropping. The reason some people saw them stop dropping is because they appearantly reset the quest to incomplete for everyone with the 1.9.1 patch and it needs to be done again. That's my understanding, hope that helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They didn't start dropping for me until I finished and turned in the quest for the furbolg along the road in the southern part of Felwood.&nbsp; After that, the drop rate on the feathers was at least 10%, and probably closer to ^^kokloz's 20%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everytime I kill a deadwood, my reputation with the Timbermaw goes down.&nbsp; I didn't realize it until I had collected about 4 feathers.&nbsp; Then I looked at my reputation and saw that it had gone from moderately hostile to almost hated.&nbsp; What do I do?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When you are at hostile or hated when you get rep your bar goes up it freaked me out to but dont worry it is not backwords</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When I started gathering reputation at Timbermaw Hold I thought it wouldn't take that long. I heard from a friend of mine that you don't gain reputation by killing beast if your revered, and he's right too. So just to remember: <br /><br />5 feathers = 50 rep<br />1 feather&nbsp; = 10 rep<br />21000 : 10 = 2100 feathers for getting exhalted<br />(humans got 10% more so 1890 feathers)<br />drop rate is like 17% or 1/6 <br />2100 x 6 = 12600 kills<br /><br />Good luck in loneny nights!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>... the feathers from day 1. You don't turn them in untill after you get to revered. All the rep you gain from hated up to revered should come from killing. <br /><br />You will gather a rather huge pile of feathers on your way to revered and you will be very very happy once you turn it in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm at 1800/12000 atm. Saved all Feathers from Unfriendly, I have about 750 atm.. so will probably have about 1200 when I hit revered.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm working on getting exalted with TH, but last night i heard a rumor that feathers can no longer be turned in after revered, meaning you would need to collect beads.<br /><br />Can anyone disprove this for me?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i'm having trouble with this one, i'm a level 54 Druid, patch 1.12.1 and Grazle is situated right outside the northern cave in Felwood, next to Nafien, who keeps attacking me. Although Nafien is attacking i managed to do the timbermaw ally quests, i've collected many feathers but i can't give them to grazle, i keep on clicking continue but nothing happens. is this a bug or something?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a lvl 62 LW. Im after a LW recipe that requires honored with TH and soon I will be after another which requires revered. These guys are either grey or green to me. The grey ones give 1 rep, the green 5. The Chieftain Bloodm... gives 15 rep. Every 5 feathers I get give me 75 rep. Because I made the mistake of fighting my way though the tunnel, I became Hostile, after 2 days of farming these feather and killing for rep, I became neutral. I was fine than. Than I wanted a recipe which required friendly, so farmed for 3 hours to get that. Now I want another and need 6000 rep. 100 feathers later and rep from killing and I'm over half way. I just picked up a item to start a quest. Handed it in and got 350 rep. I now need under 200 feathers to get to 6000 rep to became honored. It takes ages but even at lvl 62, I've goten about 6 bars done. It's time consuming but I'm determined to get these recepies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Humans for the win! 55 rep per turn in(trust me, it helps a lot).<br />I did raid groups until I was half way through neutral(turned in all my feathers too). Then I realized my rep is going to stop sometime, so I went solo for most of it. There were a couple of times where I would group with a guildie, and most of the feathers would go to me, but that was between the last strech of Honored to Revered. At Revered I had about 800 feathers to turn in, and was close to the half way mark. I figure I still have loads of grinding to do, with maybe another 1000 or so feathers to turn in for exalted. I'm setting a goal of atleast 50 feathers a day, which isn't too bad, and set at a decent pace. I can't wait to get the trinket!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Unlike most items, you can have 250 features in each stack which makes it very space efficient.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It should be noted that, one still receives the same amount of rep (5 per kill) while in a raid. Much much faster when you have a raid group of any size doing the northern area, as well, these still drop. You'll be doing it for the kill rep, though, which will be faster than trying to collect feathers, as:<br /><br />1 kill = 5 rep<br />5 feathers (if dropped) = 50 rep<br />Raid group = all dead quick x_x !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you are not getting feather, it means the two NPC's have a quest for you to complete. Until you complete the quest you will not be able to collect feathers.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
