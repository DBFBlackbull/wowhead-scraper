<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I'm just saying that coz I'm a Shaman.<br />To get this weapon you seem to need to be honored with the Thorium pipolz. So no horde/alliance thing its BOTH.<br />Then you need to turn in a Sulfran Ingot or whateveritscalled.<br />You have the plans: congratulations.<br />You need arcanite. If you have a alchemist friend it will take him 100 days to make. Not to mention you need to get the crystals first. Or you can just nuy it all but on my server it would cost about 25g per bar so thats 1250g aproximately. And you're on a hell of a server if there are more than 10 bars for sale at any given time.<br />Ok you've got the arcanite,&nbsp; now you need the 25 essences of fire and the 10 blood of the mountain.<br />Hope you're motivated.<br />That's it, all done, you've got the weapon!<br />Congratulations.<br />Now go ahead and loot the Eye off Ragnaros with 3% drop. Either you do it with your guilde 30 times till you get it, having told your guild you wanted this item (and hopefully noone will &quot;oops i didnt mean to roll&quot;). Either you just slo Ragnaros for the heck of it.<br />Mix the eye and the mace and guess what? you get a better mace.<br />Congratulations, you've got one of the most powerful weapons in the game, and you got thrown out of university, your wife left you or you lost your job coz you played too much. Happy life!<br />Who am I to say this anyway? I get 30 full days of play when i do /played. Addicted as anyone else.<br /><br />Anywho Sulfuras is way too cool.<br />I want it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As the title says:<br /><br />YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE EXALTED WITH THORIUM BROTHERHOOD. <br /><br />You just need to go see my old buddy Lokthos down in the BRD bar, with a Sulfuron ingot in your backpack. He will offer you a quest, a Binding Contract. You do not need any level of rep with the Brotherhood, just the ingot. <br /><br />I can craft this on KJ Server, alliance or horde.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>all you need to do is be a 300 blacksmith (DOES NOT matter what your blacksmithing focus is) and give a sulfuron ingot to Lokthelos Darkbringer (sp?) in the BRD bar. Then he will give you the plans. The Sulfuron Ingot is a random drop from Golemag the Incinerator in MC. Thats it! Oh, and get all the mats to actually make the darn thing (Takes a while, but is very doable) =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>*&nbsp; Sulfuron Hammer - all Blacksmiths can obtain this. To receive the plans you must bring a single Sulfuron Ingot which drops from Golemagg the Incinerator (drop rates: Thottbot / Allakazam). You need to be revered with the Thorium Brotherhood and have an ingot in your inventory when you speak to him to receive the plans. <br /><br />Now, once you actually craft the hammer (mats costs several thousand gold), you will want to obtain an Eye of Sulfuras, which has an even lower drop percentage (from Ragnaros). Combine the Sulfuron Hammer with the Eye of Sulfuras and you will get the legendary hammer, Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To Answer: <br /><br />Im honored with TB, 300 BS/Armorsmith<br /><br />You do NOT need rep, you only need 300 BS and an Ingot<br /><br />IF your a serious BS/Wep Smith/Armorsmith and in a serious raid type guild its likely you will have rep anyhow.<br /><br />An ingot on the open market costs 800-1500gp, for plans that you will likely use 1-4 times total. So I suggest you consider carefully obtaining these.<br /><br />The required mats take either significant time or significant gold, dont begin aquiring them unless your willing to put out the effort in either time or gold. The mats are the most difficult to aruire even on a mature server. If your guild has MC on farm status then its much easier. <br /><br />The hammer itself is a dull orange, only when you add the eye does it have a particle effect.<br /><br />Assuming you buy the plans, aquire the mats, you still have to wait on a drop for the eye.<br /><br />Good Luck its takes legendary pateince to get a legendary hammer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>neither the plans nor the hammer is bind on pickup, meaning that you could sell these for a hefty sum in the ah, as the average price denotes. the only problem i can forsee is that the eye of sulfuras is more likely to drop than the chance of a blacksmith either possessing that much arcanite (50 is no missprint), or the 8 sulfuron ingots.<br /><br />as far as i can tell i do not think, though i cannot confirm, that you need to be a hammersmith to make this, although i would believe you have to be. a bugger for me as i want to axesmith (such a shame i'm stuck making arcanite reapers...)</div>

In that case u will need 8 sulfuron ingots since u dont give 1 to the qst giver to give u the plans.If u are a blacksmith u can get the plans yourself for 1 sulfuron ingot from the qst giver in BRD.After u make Sulfuron Hammer (which takes a %^&amp;* load of items to get) you will need The Eye of Sulfuras to combine to make the legendary hammer Sulfuras.<br />Reputacion is not important here.Everyone can get the plans if u have Sulfuron Ingot in ur bag.<br /> Thank You.</div>
