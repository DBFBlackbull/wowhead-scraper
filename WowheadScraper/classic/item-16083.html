<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>30728</b></h3>FYI: This book can be sold on the AH for double what you pay from the NPC in BootyBay. On my server some people are actually trying to sell it for 6g!! I think this is a bit much (seeing Horde can boat to bootybay from Ratchet easily). buyout price of 2g is resonable IMO on the AH.<br /><br />Location of the NPC to buy this from: If you follow the wooden ramps all the way around to your right from the boat and keep to the lowest deck you will find old man heming in the last building:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Alliance &amp; Horde members can buy this in Booty Bay, on the Southern tip of the eastern kingdoms. The VERY southern tip. This is a contested area, so be on your toes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What are the different levels for the different fish and where can they be found? Im trying to up my fishing and today went from 150 to 175 at wetlands but it took 5 fish for each level, there has got to be a better way</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The easiest way to get to the town at Booty Bay at a lower level as Alliance is to swim from Westfall. Stay in the water until you get all the way to the southern tip, then go into the cove with the island at the mouth and you're there. As long as you stay in the water, you won't (or at least, I didn't, both times I went) run into any aggros. There are high level sharks swimming around in the ocean but I only saw one once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Old Man Heming can be found in the back corner, on the lowest level. Going in the front gate you keep to the left on the main walkway. In the back corner you'll find a shop, and he is the only NPC inside.<br /><br />By the way, there are no fish in Booty Bay. You'll have to go elsewhere to earn your gold if you didn't bring it with you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hey guys, I had a little trouble finding this vendor, if you do, here's the quick way...<br /><br />When you get to Booty Bay, you'll see the boardwalk you step onto from the boat is in the shape of a hook. Follow the hook around on the ground level boardwalk, and towards the end of it, there is a ramp on the left side that leads down. There's is a fish hook sign above the vendor's shack. Sounds easy, but MAN did I spend some time looking around this place! lol Hope this helps someone. :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The level of the fish are the same as the surrounding area. So go to an area that is your level or higher. Keep in mind higher you better bring the expensive baubles or you won't pull a single fish in. Get a lucky hat, better string and a sweet pole from AH and you won't have to rely on the baubles and night crawlers as much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WDStudios</b></h3>Back in the old days, this was sold by <i><b><u>Old Man Heming</u></b></i> at a shop called &quot;The Happy Bobber&quot; in Booty Bay. It was on the lowest floor, literally at a lower elevation than the Port Authority Building. You know that ramp in the middle of BB that goes straight into the water? If you're in the water and you go up that ramp to get into BB, the Happy Bobber will be about 10 feet to your right.<br /><br />This item <i>might</i> have also been available from other sources, but this is the only one that I can confirm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dave1477</b></h3>You do not have to see Nat pagle in Dustwallow Marsh, just buy the book (about 1 gold) and get max level 225 fishing. I would think if you wanted a higher level fishing above 225 then see in Nat pagle. Don't forget to get the Flight path in Booty bay like I did, that is one long walk. If you are low level, avoid hidden animals and gorillas along the path way down to Booty bay, try not to stray too far off the path unless you like to die. The fishing vendor in Booty bay is on the lower level boardwalk, come out of the &quot;shark jaw&quot; front entrance and head down the boardwalk opposite the ship landing, keep going to the bottom boardwalk look for the fishing symbol/ icon hanging out the front door.</div>
