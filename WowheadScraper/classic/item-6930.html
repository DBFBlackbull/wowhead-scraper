<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sseeaann</b></h3>Not sure if it's intended or a bug - the rod was NOT dropping when killing the mobs with Felguard (I've done this quest on my lock kinda late). So I killed about 20 Dragonmaw Bonewarders (which supposed to drop it), then read some comments here mentioning it wasn't dropping in a party and dismissed the pet, then it immediately started to drop.</div>
