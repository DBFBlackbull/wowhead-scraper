As the cooldown does not share with other potions, Demonic/Dark runes are amazing items not to mention easily farmable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6505</b></h3>These runes are needed for a few tailoring things, most notabley the Robe of the Void. I have found the best place to farm for then is the lower satyr camp in Felwood that is near Jadefire run. Even though the drop rate is a little bit lower, the mobs there are easier to kill and you are much less likely to be farmed by other people in my experience.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>daurenr</b></h3>i cant pick up this rune</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>daurenr</b></h3>Items BoP cannot be picked up because of some addons, so check ur addons before farming these runes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>its one time use</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can anyone tell me a good place to find these demonic rune cause I have been up and down jadefire run and killed everything and I have had no luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In Jadefire Run, lol. I got 3 in the hour that I was farming runecloth today. Too bad I am a leatherworker. XD Keep trying, you must just be having a run of bad luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, good luck farming these. I spent 5 hours in Felwood and 2 hours in Dire Maul (Came in the back door and reset the instance 3x, about 100 mobs each run)and I now have a grand total of 5 of these babies! I'm trying to find 16 for corruption. In the time that i have been farming these I have had 42 pieces of felcloth, 10 green items, 2 blue (one card and a cloth armor piece) and an epic Bow, Hurricane.&nbsp; So the moral of the story is...at least you get something farming these some how now rare items.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Grind these babies all the time.<br /><br />Useful as hell for me in MC.<br />Im a holy priest and these babies don't use the potion's cooldown cycle.<br /><br />This is how i use them.<br /><br />1. When low on mana but full health - use rune and bandage yourself.<br /><br />2. Low on mana, use potion while rune is on cooldown.<br /><br />3. Use rune if health is 100%, bandage cooldown&nbsp; should be gone so use bandage on yourself.<br /><br />Very easy. Very powerful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For days I've been searching for 20 Demonic Runes for my Robe of the Void. I've been searching everywhere. Some said Felwood had some good spots but I had to give up after 2 hours of killing the demons there. Found none!<br />Then I tried Dire Maul after plenty of people said that was a good place. Oh well...I found one!<br /><br />Last place I visit was Ashzara and that turn out to be a great place to hunt for the demonic runes. I found 6 in 1� hour. And I also found 5 felcloth that I needed for the robe.<br />The place that I hunted the Legashi in Ashzara is located 65.15.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I managed to get the 16 demonic runes needed to make the corruption blade and the best advice I can give to someone grinding this mat is too concentrate on the demons who have dropped before, they seem to drop more than others. For me this has been the demons to the northern section of that camp in Felwood and make sure you do it in the early hours because you will be competing with other players after the same mats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i farmed these in jadefire run they dropped like crazy for me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I clearly noticed that they dropped more frequently when i had one other person in my party. I recommend you have one other person working with you. <br /><br />I got mine exclusively from the satyrs south of jaedenar in felwood. took a total of 7 hours, and I started at level 58...finished with 2 bubbles left to 59...whew... what a pain, but it happened. again, it was very clear that they dropped more frequeltly in a&nbsp; party. <br /><br />I tried both other satyr areas, in aszhara, and in north felwood, and got NONE. I think its tru what people have said that, once you get one, stay in that area and work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As I'm grinding these for RotV, I checked if the Tainted Scar was a good place to grind them, so I brought another warlock, a mage, a paladin(tanked due to the fact that he can hold aggro well on demons) and a priest(who wanted Eye of Shadow :|) to kill some. Five runes in an hour, plus a lot of fun. That's twice my luck in runes and five times my usual fun when sologrinding, and there was no contest in getting them.<br /><br />Bottom line: Get a decent group and farm Dark Portal, Tainted Scar or Darkwhisper Gorge if you want Demonic Runes, it's both better and more fun. It's harder if you don't pull properly or banish properly, but it's worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have about 40 of these in my bank and so I found that they are a really good alternative to tap life for warlocks.&nbsp; They inflict Shadow damage so just pop a shadow ward and use it...Free Mana</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Hederine in southern Winterspring are a pretty decent place to get them, and you have a shot at getting an epic =)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.goldmonkee.com/rune.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldmonkee.com/rune.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is handy for priests where one can keep health high using power word shield, but where mana burns quickly.
