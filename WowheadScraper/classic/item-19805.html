<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You need 225 fishing to catch this fish.&nbsp; You can get it a variety of ways with actual fishing skills of 120 or a bit easier with skills of 150.<br /><br />There are 3 uncommon fish that you can catch in Tastyfish schools.&nbsp; This all happens during the STV fishing contest from 2-4 server time every sunday.&nbsp; Tastyfish schools spawn all over the coast.&nbsp; You can fish until 4 server time and have until 5 server time for completing the quest.&nbsp; Keefer's Angelfish is the fish to go for if you want the hat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, I did these stats AGAIN, please upvote this post so it doesn't get deleted another time.&nbsp; Since people didn't seem to understand how I got these numbers before, I will explain them.<br /><br />When thottbot tracks data, it does not (and probably cannot) record conditions such as if a fishing bobber was inside a tastyfish spawn.&nbsp; Therefore, it isn't possible to get a &quot;droprate&quot; for the fish.&nbsp; So, the only way to get a feel for how often the rare fish drop is to compare its data to that of tastyfish, since tastyfish are the only other item caught exclusively under the exact same conditions as the rare fish.&nbsp; Fortunately, we know the number of tastyfish that have been caught, as well as how many rare fish.<br /><br />This logic would be flawed if, for example, tastyfish could be caught in the competition long before rare fish were added, therefore making the tastyfish seem more common.&nbsp; Since, to my knowledge, the rare fish always have been there since the competition started, we can simply divide the number of rare fish caught by the number of tastyfish. Note that this does not take into account the other items that can be fished from tastyfish spawns (stranglekelp, oily blackmouths, ect), so a more accurate description would be for any number of tastyfish caught, an average of x% will be rare, where x is the following:<br /><br /><b>Keefer's Angelfish: 0.25%</b> (1 in every 400 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>Dezien Queenfish: 0.22%</b> (1 in every 450 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>Brownell's Blue Striped Racer : 0.18%</b> (1 in every 550 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>ANY rare fish: 0.65%</b> (1 in every 150 tastyfish)<br /><br />So if you were to catch 100 tastyfish every Sunday (which is about how many I usually get), you would have a 22% chance to get the Angelfish, or a 48% chance to get any rare fish.&nbsp; Personally, I've probably caught around 750-1000 tastyfish, and have found 3 x Dezien Queenfish.&nbsp; My chance of finding an angelfish with that many caught is somewhere around 90%.&nbsp; I shall keep on trying...<br /><br />I don't see why Blizzard would make the droprates different for each individual fish, so we can probably assume that they share the same rate (The average is 0.22%).&nbsp; With this in mind, there is obviously a rather large margain of error for these rates.&nbsp; This is because there is very little data on thottbot for the fishing competition (only a total of 233 rare fish are recorded at this time).&nbsp; If you wish to help, run thottbot while you farm and upload your data.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was wanting to confirm a question that has been stirring for a while now... is there a limit to only one person every Sunday that can catch each of the rare fish as well?&nbsp; Or can as many people that catch the thing throughout the whole 2 hours, win the prize?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I might be just lucky, but I got all three rare fishes on three competitions in a row (at one I won the pole)...I really dont see a possibility not to catch one rare if u fish from 2-4 PM in schools... I am 99% sure that you can't catch same rare fish twice (if u already got reward), anallogicly to other quest items... So its poles in hands ppl! <br /><br />PS. I'm still looking forward to 2nd win and that hook trinket... Day before yesterday I was on 36 tastyfish and got 4 stranglekelps from last school and in few seconds somebody won :) that was mindbending...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I catch the queen fish and when I click okay to bind the fish to me, I hear the &quot;loot&quot; sound in the background repeatedly.&nbsp; Okay... so I put in a ticket and keep fishing.&nbsp; Holy cow! I catch the blue striped racer!&nbsp; Of course, same stupid issue.&nbsp; I couldn't loot either fish.&nbsp; So, the loot window is still open on the blue fish and blizzard wouldn't award me either fish.&nbsp; The guy just says, &quot;it must be your addons&quot;.&nbsp; What a bunch of jerks.&nbsp; He says, &quot;you'll just have to fish for it again&quot;.&nbsp; Do they even play the stupid game?&nbsp; I blow two hours every sunday afternoon to catch a stupid virtual fish.&nbsp; So, I should blow another 10 weeks because their unwilling to award me the fish that is still open in my loot window?&nbsp; Nice job blizz...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When the tournament starts, is there a set amount of pools that spawn all over STV? Or do they respawn throughout the 2-hour period? Also, are there any specific areas where tasty fish pools spawn more often than others?</div>
