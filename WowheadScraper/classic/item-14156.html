<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6460</b></h3>Instead of making/buying this bag -- pick up the supply bag from the turn-in AD quest at LHC. There are much better uses for core leather -- unless you raid constantly and the guild back is full of it.<br /><br />You can save a ton of cash/mats if you attain revered before doing quest.<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=9226">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=9226</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>750</b></h3>The problem with the &quot;Supply Bag&quot; that rlyeh is suggesting is that it is unique. You can only have 1 &quot;Supply Bag&quot; - it's not a repeatable thing. You might as well suggest going to slay Onyxia for Onyxia Hide Backpacks ( <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17966">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17966</a> ) while you're at it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kokek</b></h3>theese bags are worth it. Mats are simple and eazy to get if you are in MC farm guild, much better sollution than waiting for onyxia bag or ZG panther drop! Having this reciepy is a moneymaking machine basicly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6828</b></h3>These sell for nearly 250g on my server (Mannoroth) and don't seem worth it to me. You might as well just get the AD bag and buy all of your bank slots and save the money until the expansion.<br /><br />Onyxia isn't difficult to down either so that may also be an option. Same goes for Panther boss in ZG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6901</b></h3>I don't know, I think these are definitely worth it (or, they were when I bought them a few months ago; see below for info). I pack a lot of crap in my bags like resistance gear and food for pets, and there's nothing worse than running out of room. Plus when doing farming runs, you want the maximum amount of space available before heading back to town in order to save time. I don't mind dropping some gold on these to save pains down the road. (And yes, AD bag is great, but unique)<br /><br />I'm curious to see if bags like this become considerably cheaper with the expansion. Maybe we'll get 20 slots? In any case, maybe it's better to save gold and find out if these drop in price with BC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tilgare</b></h3>The thing about these bags is it takes 12 MOONCLOTH... with a 4 day cooldown, it would take almost 2 months to make it... not worth it in the long run imo... unless you REALLY need the space, otherwise get the raid drops or mooncloth bags... now, it may be worth it to buy mats on AH and sell if they can really sell for 250g... you won't spend that much on the mats unless your economy is REALLY inflated. Mooncloth go for 10g each on Darkspear. You may spend 200g on mats and make 50g off of the deal... but try it with one or two before you start making a ton of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8919</b></h3>This has to be 1 of the rarest patterns, when you do get it the mats are too expensive.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8149</b></h3>If only it was bottomless... /le sigh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>4 day cooldown? :D Someone confirm that :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes they are expensive, but these 18 slot Bags are very convenient for those that really need the space...<br /><br />I am a Lvl 60 Druid on Kil'Jaeden Server and as a druid, I am always carrying around extra sets of armor for different purposes to suit my multipurpose class... it wouldn't be smart for me to try tanking with healer gear on, nor would it be right for me to try healing with crit gear on... just not efficient at all... so bag space is valuable for me.<br /><br />besides being a druid, i am also an engineer and an enchanter... all the trinkets i have collected take up more than a full bag , and i plan to collect more...<br /><br />so needless to say i am constantly fighting my inventory for more room.<br /><br />I would imagine you warlocks have the same inventory issues with all the soul shards you have to carry around taking up a bag slot for EACH ONE.<br /><br />so there is plenty of reason to spend all that fat cash on these bags... if anything they should be more expensive. and if you are complaining about the price, you probably dont need the room as badly as i do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On my warlock I currently have a Core Felcloth Bag, a Panther Hide Sack and two Bottomless Bags. I gave up 500g for the two bags. <br /><br />This gives me exactly 100 bag slots with 28 of them only able for shards.<br /><br />Now the question is, was thoose four slots really worth 500g to me? You bet they were!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually, bag space is more important for {class}.&nbsp; With all the gear for {job-1} and {job-2} and {job-3} I've eaten up tons of slots already.&nbsp; Then I'm a {profession-1}/{profession-2} which consumes a bunch more slots.<br /><br />I also reserve a few slots for {mana or healing} pots and {reagent} and {bandages}.&nbsp; Don't forget my conjured {water or food} from a mage.&nbsp; With all that stuff and five 16 slot bags I only have {random 1-32} slots for picking up stuff.<br /><br />All you {other-class} are second to {class}, we should always get first priority.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I hear so much chatter about these bags it makes me laugh.&nbsp; First of all, its not for newbs alright? Alot of us that are in End Game content really dont have much use for gold as we have 1000's in our guild bank and in mine.&nbsp; Second, after raiding for so many months now, most of us have two or 3 bags equipped and plan on adding more as time goes on.<br /><br />This really makes a difference for us to have extra spots to bring back up gear incase we wipe in BWL a few too many times.&nbsp; Or farming out in Felwood we dont have to run back to the bank to unload.&nbsp; Most of the alchemists in our guild have all 18 slot bags as they bring all the mats to guild raids and we just whisper them what we need and he makes it on the spot.<br /><br />So really, if you think 300g or the mats for the Bottomless bag are too high, all that is saying is that you need to go back and focus on playing more rather than what Mr. and Mrs. Smith have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With a name like bottomless you think i would be bigger then 18 slots</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the cost of making this bag has tripled at least.<br /><br />from 4 to 12 mooncloth, and also requiring 2 core leather, which I have yet to see at the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>noob question:<br />why is it so special? reading the thread it appears to me that you CAN'T stack thing indefinitely... so that looks pretty much like a 18 slot bag that takes ages to create?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If i could...wich i cant....id be getting 4 for my extra bag slots and like a full bank with em....i c y they r pricy b/c u use the freaking expensive mats to make it but what i just said in:in my dreams&quot; lol</div>
