If anyone has gotten more unlucky than this let me know. Here is all I've learned during camping it:\r\nYou all probably already know the four spawnpoints of the prince, the best way is to use mutliple accounts of cooperate with others rather than compete with them, to stay on top of all spawnpoints so you don't have to waste time swimming there for 4 seconds, maybe losing the tag to competitors. \r\nBuy [item=6372] and [item=7052] to move faster underwater. If there is opposite faction competition and you can't work out any sort of deal with them, your best bet is to get killed and stay in ghost form in the middle of all the four spawn points, have [item=18639] and [item=4984] as well as your faction pvp trinket in case of warlock death coil, mage sheep, rogue blind etc. you can make a \"panic\" macro using all these items simultaneously when you hear your unitscan go off. Speaking of; get the addon 'unitscan' it is 100% required unless you want to sit there spamming a \/target macro for 16 hours. add prince nazjak to the unitscan list and it'll make a loud-ass sound when it spawns.\r\nEven if you don't physically see anyone else there, they might be sitting there as a dead body, having intentionally drowned themselves to protect against blinds on prince spawn etc. \r\nFrom server reset, the first window opens up 32 hours after, meaning if the server reset at 3am on wednesday, the first window will start at thursday 11am and the window is open for 16 hours. I've seen it spawn after just 15 minutes upon window opening and just 5 minutes before the window closes, so both are just as likely. After the prince dies, the new window will be 32-48 hours. He will never spawn before 32 hours and never after 48hours, so optimally you want to cover the entire 16 hour window.","date":"2020-06-25T07:24:38-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":58,"id":3214773,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Artclass","body":"Writing my attempts \/ spawns of Prince Nazjak\r\nI found a lot of conflicting information about whether weekly reset will affect his current re spawn timer, so I tested it out\r\n1st kill (not by me, but I witnessed) NO drop @ 10:46 AM Sunday (WESTERN SHIP)\r\nnext spawn was supposed to be around 4:46pm Mon - 8:46 AM Tuesday....

Crap loot.<br />5- Inside north ship. Soloed him and I got my trinket! =:D<br /><br />The shortest respawn rate I could record was 1 day 12 hours without server reboot, so the 7 day respawn rate is not true nowadays.<br /><br />I guess that the trinket is not heavily camped in my server, and I think that the Prince pops without the need to kill nagas, its just a random spawn.<br /><br />I'll be camping Prince to get the trinket to all my (small) guild, so i'll tell you if I can find more facts about him.<br /><br />Bye,<br />6ptas</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I came to the area where the Prince spawns and made a macro (/target Prince) to see if he was up.&nbsp; He wasn't there, but I swam around killing the mobs in the area to see if he would eventually show up.<br /><br />After every kill I would press my macro to see if he had spawned.&nbsp; I was there for about 10minutes and to my suprise my macro picked up the silver elite :)<br /><br />I found him in the hull of one of the sunken ships (the ship closest to the dock). What I found interesting was that I hadn't touched any of the mobs in either of the boats, I was only killing the mobs in the ruins and those wandering on the sea floor.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting to find him so fast, and I was very suprised that he had what I wanted on the first kill.<br /><br />I hope this information helps and goodluck on getting this nice trinket :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the Charm today.&nbsp; Tried the level 1 Rogue camping trick and after about 2 weeks I logged on today pressed target /prince macro and there he was by the statue head below me. About 4:15pm on a Sunday.&nbsp; I will point out I got ganked by a 60 rogue 10 minutes later and he resisted the charm.&nbsp; Odd item to resist. 15 min cooldown and creates a 3 minute timer on Rocket helmet for you engineers.&nbsp; Looks like a green Warlock pet summon spell over the head when cast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If any item is deserved of the title &quot;Green Epic&quot;, or rather an item that is as good as a purple, this would be it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Third Time's the Charm... as they say.&nbsp; After a 10 day camp, i finally got it on 3rd kill of the Prince.<br /><br />First pop was in the bottom north hull of the easternmost ship, 2nd pop came in the middle of the bottom hull of the westernmost ship (the one right beside), and the third was over the partially buried head statue just to the south.<br /><br />I used the Lvl 1 Alt trick, but with a twist. I had my char die next to the stone arch north of the head statue.&nbsp; Once dead - but without rezzing - I was still able to target nearby mobs in range (including the Prince with the macro).&nbsp; One advantage of this is that on a PvP server i didn't have to worry about being seen, plus your Lvl1 will still aggro on the surface if a Naga happens to swim under you.&nbsp; Plus, since this can be a long and intensive grind, it doesnt hurt to be able to swim around a bit at times and view the scenery and what your Alliance friend are up to.<br /><br />For what its worth, here are the Server times that it dropped for me.&nbsp; Tue 12:05AM; Sat 12:20AM, and Sun 11:20 AM.&nbsp; From my experience, killing Naga has *no effect*, although i can't be certain that killing some Naga *may* shorten the time somewhat, but i doubt it.&nbsp; Also, it is definitely not on a fixed 32 hr spawn, but I'm sure its in a range close to that.&nbsp; For example I checked 32 hrs after our Realm went up this week, and no Prince.&nbsp; Now, I was able to get what I think were two kills in a row, so this is what the time looked like based on that.&nbsp; Fri 12:20AM -&gt; Sun 11:20AM = 35hrs.<br /><br />gl to all who are after this. To sum up, there are basically 2 methods on obtaining this.&nbsp; The Dirty Harry &quot;Do I feel lucky?&quot; method - which means you will occasionally log in to your alt to see if the Prince is there, or the hardcore &quot;I WANT this!&quot; approach, which means you drop everything else (questing, raiding, etc.) and park your Main close by and click away at all hours of the day and night.&nbsp; I took the approach that I was doing some kind of crazed faction pvp-rank grind, so it made it the boredom a bit more tolerable.&nbsp; And oh.. if you have mining as a skill, you can at least mine any of the 14 nodes close by while you wait.&nbsp; After 10 days i got mithril and iron coming out the yin-yang!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>Obtaining the trinket:</b><br />I decided to take the semi-hardcore approach about three weeks ago now. I signed up for arath basin, in arathi highlands, then just ran down to the spawn place as soon as I got out of a game, I didn't actually catch him quite this way though.<br />Funnily enough I joined a pvp group from a mates guild and they had coincedentally chosen to sign up from arathi. After first game, I run down and find him straight away, in the bow of boat. I quickly dropped group ;) Got it first kill. <br /><br /><b>Using the trinket:</b><br />Godly item for PVP. I got a resist the first time I ever used it, just as another person said(obviously by chance). It almost made me cry. I've since had very few resists. <br /><br />I have &quot;use trinket slot1&quot; bound to E, makes timing the use of this powerful trinket a lot easier. <br /><br />This is perfect for stopping mounted runners, the range is something like 30 yds. A lot cheaper than discombob too!<br /><br /><u>The trinket STUNS the target, meaning you can dps all you like without breaking the stun.</u><br /><br /><b>Why shaman should farm this:</b><br />You have no way of stunning a person so that they can't act.<br /><br />Farming the naga around the prince's spawn points will get you plenty of shiny fish scales and fish oil.<br /><br />It's like another earthshock when your earthshock or grounding totem are on cooldown.<br /><br />Two free heals or if you're feeling lucky, one big one.<br /><br /><b>1.10 means using items in ghost wolf... chase and stun!</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Crusader Strike has been shoved from a 6s to a 10s cooldown.&nbsp; The reason for this was most likely because a Paladin could open up with a melee, Crusader strike, and possibly a third with JoC, and then immediately stun for 6 seconds with HoJ, whipping out a couple more 2h attacks and, as soon as the stun ends, they CS again.&nbsp; Woah.&nbsp; Lots of damage, and there's little the enemy can do.<br /><br />Consider, however, that with the Tidal Charm, you can still perform the same stun-damage combo and leave your opponent totally helpless.&nbsp; However, CS alone is not the reason why Tidal Charm is incredible for Paladins.<br /><br />Judgment of Command does double damage against a stunned target.&nbsp; The final rank (at present) is somewhere around 500 damage if the opponent is stunned.&nbsp; Consider also that in BC, not only will there probably be a higher rank of Seal of Command, but Retribution-specced Paladins will have a 15% base bonus to their critical strike chance with Judgments.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; And with Judgment of the Crusader on the Paladin's opponent, consider the insane amount of damage a JoC crit would unleash.&nbsp; Pile on Avenging Wrath, 20s worth of 30% extra damage (and some badass looking angel wings to boot).<br /><br />So, perform the following combo, as a level 70 Paladin with Tidal Charm equipped and ready, for instant-win:<br /><br />Avenging Wrath<br />Seal of the Crusader<br />Judgment of the Crusader (before entering melee range)<br />Seal of Command<br />Melee, Crusader Strike (for 8s, until Judgment cooldown is up)<br />Hand of Justice, immediate JoC and refresh Seal<br />Consecration (Rank 6) (granted, the mana cost is greater than the total damage output, but it's a 592 damage DoT which will probably do more with JotC up on the foe)<br />Melee, Crusader Strike (CD should be up for CS, just whack until Judgment timer is up)<br />Tidal Charm, immediate JoC and refresh Seal (3 seconds more of stun, and since your Judgment timer is up after 8 seconds, and your stun total is 9 , you can perform a full-on JoC TWICE.)<br />Melee, Crusader Strike (Timer should once again be up for it), and you should be able to melee your foe to death after that, if they aren't already dead.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He has a spawn time range from 12hrs-48hrs<br />I've seen him killed 2 times in one day and i've seen him spawn after 42 hours.<br /><br />Killing naga won't help, IF YOU DO KILL HIM and don't get the trinket you will at least know what time he was killed so you can start checking after 12hrs. <br /><br />He spawn in 4 places:<br />-In the tample <br />-outside the tample (by a big head) <br />-in both boats<br /><br />What i think you should do is:<br /><br />1. Make the macro /target prince <br />The range of that macro is VERY VERY FAR infact you can target him and have no idea where hes at.<br /><br />2. Check every hour when you can.<br /><br />3. Keep the toon you want the trinket for there<br />because there are more people then you think&nbsp; that want this and if you find him killing him in a fast AND SMART way is the best way to do it.<br /><br />4. STAY CALM (Make sure you dont aggro everything around him because you will die really fast if you're in the late 30's and early 40's)<br /><br />!KEEPING YOUR TOON THERE IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT!<br /><br />If you keep trying you will get it, im still out here looking for him myself but i had some friends that needed it more then me at the time. I've seen the trinket drop quite a bit but i think the drop rate is more like 30-20% and not as close to 50%<br /><br />DON'T GIVE UP!<br /><br />Hope this helps all of you</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This trinket works on lvl 70s. I was in the arena wit my parnter 2v2 Nagrand. The opposing team had this s.o.b. We went up against them 3times and i was stunned THREE times. woot &gt;.&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>15 minutes.<br /><br /> I don't think the trinket is used in random fights, but against elites or in duels this thing will give you the edge.<br /><br />I got Prince Nazjak yesterday, but he didnt drop it :s</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>does anyone know the range on this..? would be good for stoping fleeing foe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Killed him twice now and no trinket T_T</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was doing the quests from Faldir's Cove and saw Nazjak by chance. Just before he died he ran in to the large stone roof/platform and was apparently unlootable. Fun stuff.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 25th 2007 9:08pm by Stinkyman</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Very Nice, although a bit of a long cooldown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How often does he spawn?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got one!<br />After week twice a day checking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this trinket is in fact very nice. I highly recomend it for druids, esp feral druids in pvp, since it gives you another caster interupt. also handy fro frontloading damage on an elete if you have brutal impact and inproved shread... you can pounce then charm for 6 seconds of stun to build combo points, then rip, heal, and get to dire bear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I decided to wander over there today, and behold, found him withing 5 minutes, killed him, and he dropped it. Total of 15 minutes out of my day round trip... :) He was down by the temple looking thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's easy to find him, and as he is not elite very easy to beat.<br /><br />To find him, just make a macro with &quot;/tar Prince Nazjak&quot; and swim around the area where he spanws.<br />Found him by the ruins. <br />You best check twice a day, to make sure you get to find him first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>UPDATE - <br />After killing him five times the spawn rate is between 36 and ~44 hrs. I had it at exactly 36 hrs and up to 44. <br /><br />I now have 2 of the charms but they unfortunately share the 15min cool down. So no point in killing twice...<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 20 13:42:24 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What kind of cooldown does this thing have?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Atleast twinks can still make use of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>its not unique, but would they share the same cooldown? if not 6 second stun after cheap shot would be 8 then up to 13 if you used kidney shot :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This trinket is, hands down, just about the most useful thing in the game I have ever found. Getting one can be a pain; you have to walk way the hell off the beaten path in Arathi to find one elite who isn't guarenteed to drop it the first time you kill him.<br /><br />But the effort is completely and totally worth that effort. The stun is useable on just about any mob, except those otherwise immune to stuns anyway (like bosses). Even raid mobs are vulnerable to it, making it useful for God knows how many things (from stopping runners to buying you precious seconds to save yourself). I shouldn't even have to note it's use in PVP; it gives classes without such an ability three beautiful, precious seconds to do any number of life-saving things.<br /><br />And yet... this is the most unsung trinket in the entire game. People are constantly asking me where I got mine, and it seems that nobody ever uses it.<br /><br />Best tactic is to alternate between this and other trinkets; when you use the Tidal Charm, switch out to something else while it cools down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First try in 2 days of farming : loot :D<br />/love</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After many many hours of never even finding Nazjak, he spawned in the ruins area found him using the /target Prince Nazjak macro. Dropped the charm first try. Building a nice collection of charms for myself now. Arena Grandmaster, Master Angler and now Tidal Charm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just got this first try when i logged my camped warrior on friend's acc and my 39 rogue twink. it doesn't always stun for 3 secs, which is annoying. going for arena grand master trinket now =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bandersnatch</b></h3>So I spent many days and hours farming Prince Nazjak for the Tidal Charm. These were my findings:<br /><br />1. I assumed he had a spawn timer of 32-48 hours. This is was I researched and what was told to me by many others (this spawn timer held true).<br />2. He spawned in 4 different locations for me:<br /> a. Inside the Bunker<br /> b. Inside the Western Ship<br /> c. Inside the Eastern Ship<br /> d. Next to the half buried head in the ruins<br />3. The times between my kills were 33 hours 54 minutes, 44 hours 18 minutes &amp; 43 hours 3 minutes<br />4. He dropped the trinket 2 times in 3 kills (1 kill I wasn't able to tag in time and don't know what he dropped)<br />5. I used the Unitscan addon to help find him<br /><br />Good luck finding your trinket!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wowZhenek</b></h3>Saw corpse, waited for 32 hours and came back to camp. 14 hours later it spawned. Got the trinket</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Baracuda</b></h3>Seems to resist a lot lately, wouldn't recommend getting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tytytyty</b></h3>Finally got the trinket after killing Prince Nazjak 10 times. If anyone has gotten more unlucky than this let me know. Here is all I've learned during camping it:<br />You all probably already know the four spawnpoints of the prince, the best way is to use mutliple accounts of cooperate with others rather than compete with them, to stay on top of all spawnpoints so you don't have to waste time swimming there for 4 seconds, maybe losing the tag to competitors. <br />Buy <a href="/classic/item=6372/swim-speed-potion">Swim Speed Potion</a> and <a href="/classic/item=7052/azure-silk-belt">Azure Silk Belt</a> to move faster underwater. If there is opposite faction competition and you can't work out any sort of deal with them, your best bet is to get killed and stay in ghost form in the middle of all the four spawn points, have <a href="/classic/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector">Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector</a> and <a href="/classic/item=4984/skull-of-impending-doom">Skull of Impending Doom</a> as well as your faction pvp trinket in case of warlock death coil, mage sheep, rogue blind etc. you can make a &quot;panic&quot; macro using all these items simultaneously when you hear your unitscan go off. Speaking of; get the addon 'unitscan' it is 100% required unless you want to sit there spamming a /target macro for 16 hours. add prince nazjak to the unitscan list and it'll make a loud-ass sound when it spawns.<br />Even if you don't physically see anyone else there, they might be sitting there as a dead body, having intentionally drowned themselves to protect against blinds on prince spawn etc. <br />From server reset, the first window opens up 32 hours after, meaning if the server reset at 3am on wednesday, the first window will start at thursday 11am and the window is open for 16 hours. I've seen it spawn after just 15 minutes upon window opening and just 5 minutes before the window closes, so both are just as likely. After the prince dies, the new window will be 32-48 hours. He will never spawn before 32 hours and never after 48hours, so optimally you want to cover the entire 16 hour window.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Artclass</b></h3>Writing my attempts / spawns of Prince Nazjak<br />I found a lot of conflicting information about whether weekly reset will affect his current re spawn timer, so I tested it out<br />1st kill (not by me, but I witnessed) NO drop @ 10:46 AM Sunday (WESTERN SHIP)<br />next spawn was supposed to be around 4:46pm Mon - 8:46 AM Tuesday.... I go there early and hard camped...(I even did an all nighter to be sure)...he didn't respawn before the 8am weekly restart so turns out IT DOES completely push back his timer to 32h-48h after Tuesday Morning reset. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;CONFIRMED 1000% PERCENT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let that failed all-nighter camp not be in vain!<br /><br />2nd kill was @ 4:12pm Server time on wednesday EXACTLY 32 hours 12 min after weekly server restart (no drop) (EASTERN SHIP)<br /><br />3rd kill was @ 11:55am Server time on Friday, 43h 33 min (no drop) (WESTERN SHIP)<br /><br />4th kill was @ 2:48 am Server time on Sunday 39h 53 min DROP BOOYAAAH (IN RUINS)<br /><br />Tips:<br />UNITSCAN - get this addon it's essential....]] - Makes a loud noise when he spawns so if you're afk you can hear his spawn<br /><br />Macro: Use this macro below, it will target it him and mark him with a green triangle, super important otherwise it's hard to find him and people will beat you to him (happened to me the first spawn)<br /><br />/target Prince<br />/script SetRaidTarget(&quot;target&quot;, 4)<br /><br />Bring Swim Speed potions.... they are NOT optional... there are so many people who come or camp this spot, and you need to be able to get to the spawn first, and popping helps A TON in pvp encounters (I had to fend off about 3 or 4 Grand Marshals throughout one night)<br />Azure Silk belt for 15% swimspeed<br />Deepdive Helmet for engineers to hide for long periods of time / water breathe (potions work too/noggenfoggers).<br /><br />I'm on a Medium pop server and there's almost always someone camping it or looking for timer. Since Spawn window is 16 hours, knowing the timer is only knowing when to hard camp, he can pop @ ANY time of the hour, it is not tied to a specific time he was last killed at. I sat here for a week and devoted my life to this charm. Any questions... hit me up!<br />GOOD LUCK<br />LIVE BY THE CHARM<br />DIE BY THE CHARM</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xeptra</b></h3>Just want to confirm, Nazjak does spawn in SoD phase 2. Just killed him and looted Tidal Charm.<br /><br />There was a random server restart at saturday 3AM, and I killed him sunday 23:50 PM, roughly 45 hours after the restart.<br />Still can't 100% confirm if his respawn timer is reset with every server restart, but I do believe so based on other comments and what I've seen personally.<br /><br />Xeptra, Living Flame EU</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>smivylol</b></h3>For those of you trying to farm tidal charm in SoD, here's some helpful info.<br />1. 32-48 hour spawn window<br />3. Tuesday server reset DOES reset his spawn timer. If servers open at 10:00am Tuesday, he can spawn anywhere between 5:00pm Wednesday and closes at Tuesday 9:00am.</div>
