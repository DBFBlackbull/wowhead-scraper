<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Man i maybe been farmming in Un Goro for 1hr 30min, killed around 30 Elite Stone Guard's and only 1 dropped! They got to make the drop rate higher for the Essence of Earth!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks, good to know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this drops off of desert rumblers in NW silithus, coordinates around 23.18. this is also a good place to get essence of air because it is surrounded by other types of elementals that drop that, got 10&nbsp; air in 3 hours. unfortunately, i have killed around 100 of the rumblers and recieved nothing, will keep trying.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Drop rate was VERY good when compared to the Essence of Air from Silithus and also the Essence of Water from Felwood. I did one swipe through their corner and killed them all, and picked up four Essences in that one run, three of them in a row.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Maybe I'm just getting unlucky, but i've farmed for essence of earth here all day and haven't seen one. Now the essence of air has fallen like candy. The Dust Stormers have dropped like 12 of them. Need EoE though so I'll get back to it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Of course as soon as I open my mouth two drop...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to Silithus and farmed for 2.5 hours.&nbsp; Killed 350 mobs and here's what I ended up with.<br /><br />- 3 Essence of Earth<br />- 124 Core of Elements<br />- 17 Core of Earth<br />- 2 Star Rubys<br />- 6 Uncommon (green) drops<br />- 180 Solid Stones (my bags were full or else I would've had more)<br /><br />On a side note, if your profession is mining, I also got <br />- 32 Mithril Ores<br />- 2 True Silver<br />- 20 Thorium Ores<br />- 1 Azerothian Diamond<br />- 27 Dense Stones<br /><br />This was done on a 70 paladin with no downtime. I did group up mobs for 1/2 of the time and maybe that's why my ratio was lower?&nbsp; Also, nobody was on the map the entire time.&nbsp; <br /><br />For the first 160 mobs, I didn't get anything. All 3 Essence of Earth dropped from the the west side mountain range. (A bit more west from the above posters location)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Around 23, 14 in Silithus.&nbsp; Since nobody posted Coords,&nbsp; Figured I would help some of the people out here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Guardians are ok but there is very few of them and the amount of time it take to kill one I could have killed 4-5 mobs in silithus.<br /><br />Yes they drop stones, but if all you need essence of earth silithus guys are the best spot.<br /><br />Guardians are good if you only need 1 or 2 essence cause they have a high chance to drop em, but if you need more then that you can get it faster in silithus.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>NW corner of Silithus on the Elementals. I've found 3 of them in an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Un'goro Crater. Stone Guardians. Yeah, those level 60-61+'s. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have ben farming in silithus for 2 hours in NW corner at the desert rumblers, and havent got a single one!<br />Think im gonna try in Felwood on the Infernal bodyguards.. They have better droprate then desert rumblers. Hope it'll get better :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What are they used for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found 2 in the SW corner of Silithius in 4 trips and about 3.5 hours. Need more to make a Hammer of the Titans. Lots of grinding for little return to be honest, but AH prices are too high most of the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Their drop rate on useful items seems pretty high.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CCow</b></h3>Easiest way to farm for this Essence seems to be The Crystal Vale, in northwestern Silithus (around 24, 14).<br />The <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11746/desert-rumbler">Desert Rumbers</a> there can drop it, the droprate isn't the best, but at least its non-zero.<br />They don't have any relevant abilites, so they are quite good for doing AoE pulls.<br /><br />As of right now it's quite a pain, though, since a lot of players are still doing them for the <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=6805/stormers-and-rumblers#comments">&quot;Stormers and Rumblers&quot; </a> quest you get from <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13278/duke-hydraxis">Duke Hydraxis</a>.<br />This will likely be less of an issue a couple of months into Classic, still don't expect 0 competition on these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Budden</b></h3>I got out of MC last week at around 4000/6000 Hydrax rep. Thought I would help out an old friend with his Archmage chest, Over the last few days of sporadic farming, I'm sat at 5700/6000 Hydraxian rep, which puts me at about 340ish mobs killed, I have 2 essences to show for it. The drop rate is substantially lower than it was in vanilla. Probably been adjusted because of the phasing.</div>
