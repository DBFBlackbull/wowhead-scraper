I am on moonrunner, BTW got it off the 3 kill by the island on the frozen lake, south eastern edge on lake by the building. heard its the most common spot to drop from and they were correct or i was very lucky</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I would like to add something too the discussion.<br /><br />This enchant is not useless. It might not proc often but the 20% slower attack speed works on ALL bosses even in NAXX! That means 20% less damage for 5 seconds. Even if it procs only a few times it's way better then crusader on a tank weapon. Crusader heals about 150 and gives more ap but who cares for a tank really? He needs to sunder anyway for that reason i think icy chill &gt; crusader on the weapon of a tank.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have seen a very wide range of prices on this formula. One day, there will be 10 of them on the AH from 2-8G, then a week later somebody will be trying to sell one for like 60G.

You can't see the sword, just a big old white blob... Kind of depressing. :( When I'm stealthed it calms down a bit and looks nice I spose, but still a beacon to any ally within 5 miles :O hehe..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I put this on a rather fast off-hander, and it procced about as much as much as firy :) Sethac, I'm pretty sure you're right.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, i've seen a lot of people complaining about the proc rate of this compared to fiery. Well, if i understand it correctly icy has to do with the speed of the weapon, and fiery is per minute. I also have seen that most that complain are using slow weapons with it. <br /><br />My question is this: Have rogues with a fast off hand found this to be useful at all?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol bought it for 2g :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>weibe23</b></h3>in Classic WOW hopefully icy weapon enchant works again..as it originally did. <br /><br />bllizzard broke the enchant going into BC, when players noticed icy weapon was doing nothing, in a BC patch blizzard said <b>icy weapon is now working as intended</b> players tested it and it was still doing nothing.<br /><br />i did a GM ticket back then on it, (when you got GMs in 40 minutes or less) the GM was seriously evasive on the issue of this enchant working even as the tooltip states, ended GM ticket with <b>working as intended</b> and the standard joyous send off.<br /><br />working as intended, means not working as it should, but the way blizzard wants it to, but won't openly respond why. i believe blizzard removed the slow, because they did not want too many classes having access to a slow or on some classes additional slows</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mairwyn67</b></h3>I wanted to post here as I have just finished farming for this enchant on the <b>Remulos</b> server. <b> It took me 5 hours and 8 mins</b> on my Holy Priest. I know it took that long as I used my Sacred Candle buffs whilst doing it. I don't know if that is any help to anyone. It is the longest it has ever taken to drop. When I farmed it in vanilla, it dropped within an hour. I even farmed it for friends and I have had it drop within a few kills. But this time...oh Lordy....twas a bit niggly in the pain department :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Protag1</b></h3>Took me 2 days with my Lv58 mage(50-80kills) for it to drop. Gl bros</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aikoo1211</b></h3>Farmed today during TBC CLASSIC. Took about 50-60 kills. just around an hour of killing. (Which i know is much luckier than most) Goes for pretty cheap on Herod, but I got cheap and decided to farm it out.</div>
