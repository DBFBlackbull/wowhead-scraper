Dont bother with any of the mobs outside, just run right through. You'll get nonstopdazed, and your VW will be sacced when you almost get to the tower. If you manage to lose aggro, hang out in front of the tower and get another void out. If you cant lose agro, Die and Res. Then get another void out. Try to run up the stairs; the two tortured whatevers will daze you and then the four wasps will insta-appear and kill you by the time you make it to the top, if you get lucky. Run back to your corpse at the top and res, get another void out and loot the bag, bringing 2 lvl 57's out (be sure you're at full health\/mana). Jump off the tower and run as fast as you can, saccing your void and running, and see how far you get before dying. then Res and you're done! Only 4 stones used! \n\nThis is assuming you dont want to spend 30 minutes getting to the top, and you want to do it in 10. If you want to try to kill everything, well, you're still probably screwed by the two tortured druids you cant separate at the start of the tower, who will auto-spawn 1-3 wasps when they die, making it 2-4 mobs you have to fight. Of course, if one of them is a tortured druid, it complicates things even more. So plan on dying and running a lot. ^^","date":"2005-07-06T15:57:11-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ReikaLB","importedSubject":"How to do as a 57 Warlock"},{"commentv2":1,"number":4,"id":2703749,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"talk to Umber in moonglade, follow a quick 3 step quest completion, and you get a great ring and 14k XP!\n\nworth doing.","date":"2005-07-06T15:57:11-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"reeks","importedSubject":"this quest is great"},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":2703762,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"it's hard, i'm a lvl 55 priest... :(","date":"2005-08-12T03:57:11-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"BlitZan","importedSubject":"<Blank>"},{"commentv2":1,"number":6,"id":2703771,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"If you're a hunter, this worked for me.&nbsp; Put a frost trap outside of tower, pull two guys inside to frost trap and then charge in and up tower.&nbsp; Feign at top.&nbsp; Now here i had a little engineering to help.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>make sure your VW is out and you are Soulstoned. Dont bother with any of the mobs outside, just run right through. You'll get nonstopdazed, and your VW will be sacced when you almost get to the tower. If you manage to lose aggro, hang out in front of the tower and get another void out. If you cant lose agro, Die and Res. Then get another void out. Try to run up the stairs; the two tortured whatevers will daze you and then the four wasps will insta-appear and kill you by the time you make it to the top, if you get lucky. Run back to your corpse at the top and res, get another void out and loot the bag, bringing 2 lvl 57's out (be sure you're at full health/mana). Jump off the tower and run as fast as you can, saccing your void and running, and see how far you get before dying. then Res and you're done! Only 4 stones used! <br /><br />This is assuming you dont want to spend 30 minutes getting to the top, and you want to do it in 10. If you want to try to kill everything, well, you're still probably screwed by the two tortured druids you cant separate at the start of the tower, who will auto-spawn 1-3 wasps when they die, making it 2-4 mobs you have to fight. Of course, if one of them is a tortured druid, it complicates things even more. So plan on dying and running a lot. ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it's hard, i'm a lvl 55 priest... :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're a hunter, this worked for me.&nbsp; Put a frost trap outside of tower, pull two guys inside to frost trap and then charge in and up tower.&nbsp; Feign at top.&nbsp; Now here i had a little engineering to help. Wait for FD to recharge.&nbsp; Put down one frost trap. Pull the goo out of the case and two mobs will spawn. Hit the one that isn't frozen.&nbsp; I had engineering here so I used &quot;The Big One&quot; to do some damage and help me out but i would suggest being ready to use a good heal potion.&nbsp; Anyway, kill one and loot it before you die. I had a parachute cloak so i just jumped and feigned at the bottom of the tower.&nbsp; There is probably an alchemy alternative.<br /> I did this at 55.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as a 54 rogue getting to the top of the tower was easy, just distracted the 5 things at the base and stealthed my way up ... but the hard part was killing the bugs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if i a priest at 58 can solo this quest line free their souls and clear the tower you guys shouldn't have any problems and I'm not even a shadow no one said every quest was made to be soloed any way just cause your gimp doesn't mean you should turn others away from a quest if you did 5 out of 8 quests why give up when soo close to end of chain it was great xp while getting items for quest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just did this quest as a 55 Ice Mage.&nbsp; Was pretty flawless, just ran up into the top of the tower and died then rezed.&nbsp; Then killed the drones and used slow fall to jump out of the tower.&nbsp; Only died once. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lev60 Frost Mage..<br /><br />there are 2 Undead and 3 Drone guarding the base of the tower..<br /><br />Blizzard once outside, frost nova, blizzard again..<br /><br />Ice Barrier, Arcane Exp them =)<br /><br />You are the winner!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just take off all your gear, run to the top of the tower....die instantly.&nbsp; Spawn at the top, put all gear back on...heal up, grab the item...kill one, grab other item...jump for your life (will probably die).&nbsp; Rez, then run and turn it in...this was a lot easier than killing 8 sentinels and 8 druids IMO.<br /><br />Solo'd.....56 Warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im i the only one that got like 4 silithid goo becasue i keep on getting them then what i whent there for</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you need to kill the ambushers (green wasp-looking things) to get the encrusted object&nbsp; (encrusted silithid object is a DROP off the ambushers . *not* in the pot of goo). i killed one of the ambushers and looted it right before i died. thankfully it was on the first one i killed. after looting, i ran off the edge, died, spirit healed and went to valor's rest to cash in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>OneEyedLeftist</b></h3>If you are doing this quest in WoW Classic, before you go in, TURN OFF AUTO LOOT. DON'T TAKE THE GOO. You don't need it, but if you pick it up silithid will constantly spawn on top of you. And if you delete it, it will delete the quest and you'll have to do it all over again!<br /><br />The goo isn't needed and just seems to be there to kill you.</div>
