Distract works nice here as you weave through them.<br /><br />There are 2 guards immediately at the books location (For me the guards were paladin it may vary though)<br /><br />Sapping one and throwing a blind powder at the other will give you all the time you need to loot the book (around 5 seconds to loot it) and get out of there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's in the town hall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Alright. I ran into Hearthglen, lost the beginning gaurds, summoned voidwalker, then individually made him aggro all the gaurds around the book. Grabbed the book, sacrificed the voidwalker, and ran like hell...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This can be soloed as a Hunter, albeit with one death unless you get really lucky.<br /><br />Send your pet in to aggro into the building.&nbsp; Follow him in and have him attack the guy down the hall to the left, and then into the main room to the right to attack the guards in there.<br /><br />Run into the main room turn right and run towards the podium.&nbsp; If you can make it all the way there, feign death there.&nbsp; If not, when you rez, rez at this end of the room because two scarlet guards take up position at the opposite end of the room.<br /><br />After you rez or get up from FD, rez your pet and then send him at the two guards.&nbsp; A freezing trap pet pull might get a little extra time.&nbsp; It didn't help me much as the pet's target got the trap.<br /><br />While your pet fights, run and shift-click on the BOOK on the table.&nbsp; There are several chairs around the table.&nbsp; Be careful not to shift-click on a DAMN chair.&nbsp; You will be stuck in it while you try to move and will sort of be stuck under a table or something as the guards kill you...<br /><br />Once you get the book, run back towards the podium and FD.&nbsp; You'll be safe to hearth out from there.<br /><br />As an added convenience, if you're an engineer and have a gnomish cloaking device, though, you can run out.&nbsp; Before rezzing my pet, I switch to cheetah and cloaked.&nbsp; The 10 seconds was enough time for me to get out of the building and downt he road a little ways (still within the city) to a safe area where I was able to rez the pet and hop on my tiger and run away.</div>

I was suprised to see so many rogues had trouble. <br /><br />Its just distract guards by the entracne, then you go in to the little room to the left. There there is another one that is very close to you. Now you simply distract again run in and then you sap and blind the 2 by the book, open it and vanish then run.
