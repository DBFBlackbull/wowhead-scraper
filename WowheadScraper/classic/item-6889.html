I couldn't find any cave but there were plenty outside the small caves and in the area.<br /><br />Last year I remember killing birds in Moonbrock, Westfall, on the graveyard. About 10 sec respawn and a lot of birds but I couldn't find any birds there this year so I guess Blizzard removed them from the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Orik</b></h3>For you Hordies out their, small eggs can be Farmed in Mulgore From Plainstriders and Swoops. Swoops have the highest drop rating For eggs. I barely even got one From a plainstrider. Swoops recommended.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9558</b></h3>I've found recently that farming in Mulgore is difficult because the Swoops spawn slowly (and this is mostly what everyone is looking for/killing) and the Plainstriders have a next-to-nothing drop rate. There are, however, Dire Condors in the northern and southern parts of Redridge Mountains (twink alliance territory) - I picked up around 12 in about 10 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>249</b></h3>South of MoonBrook is an excellent farming spot for these eggs.<br /><br />It is quite easy to get to for Horde, and even easier to get to for alliance.<br /><br />Horde: Simply catch the zep to Grom'gol, ride/walk/swim up the coast until you reach Westfall, easy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I love opportunist scalpers, 2g for small eggs, just because they're use on a christmas quest!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Glad to see the christmas spirit so alive and well and thriving in the auction houses.<br />It must be hard for the horde to get enough eggs, if they have to hunt the few Swoops flying around in Mulgore to extinction.<br />Clearly only an effortless quest for the alliance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>high demand = high prices, no need to get upset.&nbsp; head out and find your own if you dont want to pay, takes a few minutes is all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sounds like there's a lot of fools being easily parted with their money on some of the realms.<br /><br />On Hellscream I've been selling the cookies already made, often with milk for 50 silver.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The best place to farm these BY FAR is Moonbrook, Westfall at the graveyard, 2 Fleshrippers spawn every 10 seconds and half of them have eggs.&nbsp; Also got like 3 lowbie green items in about 5 minutes, kinda odd.&nbsp; The only hard part is spacing out their corpses.<br /><br />Ended up getting about 120 eggs in 15 minutes</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what zone do these drop most in?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those on Alliance, by far the best place is Darkshore, just east of Auberdine. Kill Moonkin, they drop them like crazy... In less than 1 hr I got over 120... Use AOE and slaughter them all.</div>

If you are too lazy to get the eggs, but dont want to pay 3 gold for a stack, then that's your problem, not the seller's.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How ironic that we're celebrating the Tauren legend of rebirth and renewal by hunting these little &amp;*!@ers to extinction so we can make some cookies for a fat old orc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just farmed up 80 eggs in 20 minutes on my Orc Hunter in Darkshore, killing Moonkin southeast of Auberdine. The Moonkin are real close together and spawn crazy-fast. Definitely recommended to everyone, including Horde. I saw a few low-level NEs questing, but no one else. Darkshore is pretty quiet, I think (I'm on an old server, as well).<br /><br />Last year I farmed owls on Teldrassil with my paladin alt, and got a nice stack of gold to buy bags with. The owls there can even drop two eggs at a time, so it might even be faster than Darkshore for a high-level character.<br /><br />I can't recommend Mulgore; the swoops do drop eggs at a fair rate but they're ridiculously far apart. Not for people wanting to mass-produce, at all.<br /><br />Happy farming! These cookies make me want to make some real ones...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was so dissapointed that after BC came out, the Dragonhawks outside of Silvermoon City in the Bloof Elf starting zone have a 150% drop rate for small eggs (1 or 2 per kill). The auction house prices shot down to 50s from 2g but they're slowly rising again. Made about 15g this week from them, so I'm not terribly complaining, but I'd rather be making 25g!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Um. . . hello?<br />Im a level 8 night elf, and when NOT in the christmas, i made 5gs selling these eggs.<br />How, may you ask?<br />Simple.&nbsp; In Teldrasil, there are like, level 3 owls, that drop like, two each.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Mulgore.&nbsp; Westfall. tsk tsk tsk.&nbsp; Shame on you all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is there no place for the Horde like the cemetary behind the Moonbrook schoolhouse? This is fun as well as profitable. They almost got my level 30 last week because they came so fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I find the moonkins very good.. they drop ALOT</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yet another thing in which the Horde gets the short end of the stick...swoops are totally rare in Mulgore, the one Horde area that they hang out in, compared to the Vultures in Westfall and Owls in Darkshore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Beat the inflated prices at the AH by farming these yourself. It's cheaper AND you can sell the extras for the same exorbitant fees that they command this time of year.<br /><br />There is a small field in Westfall, just east of Sentinel Hill and North of The Dead Acre where only birds and pigs spawn. They seem to be place holders for each other and constantly spawn. If you kill all the birds and only pigs are left, start killing the pigs and the birds will repop. Much easier than trying to grind Swoops in Mulgore (which seem to go extinct this time of year).<br /><br />If you are Horde, you can still grind here. If there are Alliance players questing in this area, they will be in the high teens to low twentys and will probably leave a higher level alone. There are more than enough mobs to go around--they continually spawn.<br /><br />Sorry I do not have more precice coordinates to give for this field. It's the one with all the birds and pigs that's just East of Sentinel Hill and a bit North of the Dead Acre (which also has some birds in and around it--you can make the circuit). You should be able to find it.<br /><br />Happy Egg Farming<br /><br />edited spelling<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 2nd 2007 3:45pm by stevenator</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The gold farmers in my server (warsong) had these eggs on the AH at 2/5 buyout the morning that the Christmas holiday started.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I farmed 50 small eggs with my level 16 Horde rogue in Darkshore. If you're lucky enough to have a flexible schedule, just do it past midnight when hardly anybody's playing. Much easier. I had 45 eggs before people who cared finally spotted me and started patrolling the moonkin areas, so I just grabbed five more to make it a round number and hearthstoned out. Wonderful fun. :)</div>

Then I farmed like 60 or something in a very short time, and put em all on AH .. When I came back from school I had gotten 6g :)<br /><br />Atm. I have 40g as lvl 16 :b</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DoctorBunny</b></h3>Hey, Horde players: I ran myself ragged getting from Ogrimmar to Darkshore, for that was supposed to be the closest place to farm small eggs.
