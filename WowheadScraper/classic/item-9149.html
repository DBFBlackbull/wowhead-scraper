Saturn is symbolic of fears, restraints, discipline, bondage, limitation, material greed (a need for more no matter how much already has), using money to bond others (such as what corporations do who don't treat their employees well), etc. Kabbalistically (mystical kabbala, not orthodox\/tradition jewish kabbala), it represents Binah.. but that's a whole  book in itself.\n\nGold of course represents the sun, the core essence or Higher Spirit. The equivalent in christian understanding is one's Holy Guardian Angel who knows all what's best and tries to guide one. Doing what is good for one's spirit naturally, working for both the good of oneself as well as others. Kabbalistically, this is Tiphareth.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>...rather, the cooldown is on your character.<br /><br />The various transmutes activate your character's Transmutation cooldown with varying durations (depending on the transmute) but the stone itself does not have a cooldown.<br /><br />So, no you cannot get around the cooldown by using multiple stones, etc.<br /><br />By the way, this is how item cooldowns work in general. They are tied to your character, not the item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Philosiphers' Stone is used for Transmuations. Can only use it once a day apparently. (24H cooldown.)I assume the Alchemists' Stone is the same deal with a significantly shorter cooldown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got one of these from a Mithril Deposit I was mining (in Arathi Highlands, I believe but it may have been Alterac Monutains). Only the second gem I have ever goten from a Mithril Deposit (usually just Mithril ore and maybe Solid Stone. The other gem was a Star Ruby the following day).<br /><br />You might try giving some Mithril ore to a jewelcrafter and letting him use Prospecting on it (basically converts 5 ore into a random gem (sometimes two) and mithril dust, but maybe this reagent might result also?). Mithril is too valuable to me right now as a Blacksmith to roll the dice on some random gems (I send any copper, tin, or iron ore I collect to a friend. He prospects it and tells me what he got (yes I trust him that much. I know him in RL). We usually split the gems based on what each of us can use for crafting purposes).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Achieving the Philosopher's Stone is the Western Tradition's equivalent to the Eastern Tradition's &quot;Nirvana&quot;.. aka Enlightenment.<br /><br />Due to Christianity's desire to stop people from from learning the Hermetic Sciences (aka Metaphysics, aka Magick), very little is known about it by the general public, however, there are many people who actively study and practice.<br /><br />In symbology (from alchemy to astrology), iron represents saturnian energies. Saturn is symbolic of fears, restraints, discipline, bondage, limitation, material greed (a need for more no matter how much already has), using money to bond others (such as what corporations do who don't treat their employees well), etc. Kabbalistically (mystical kabbala, not orthodox/tradition jewish kabbala), it represents Binah.. but that's a whole book in itself.<br /><br />Gold of course represents the sun, the core essence or Higher Spirit. The equivalent in christian understanding is one's Holy Guardian Angel who knows all what's best and tries to guide one. Doing what is good for one's spirit naturally, working for both the good of oneself as well as others. Kabbalistically, this is Tiphareth. When actively seeking enlightenment, we are just below it (on the ascension to &quot;heaven&quot;), and when one is able to come into full harmony with what one's True Will is (not self-will), then they reach such a state of enlightenment where everything they wish to do, to accomplish, just happens without suffering (saturn). etc etc</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If it's a 48 hour cooldown, does that apply only to arcanite? More specifically, can you transmute Iron &gt; Gold 24 hours after using it to transmute arcanite? I'm betting the answer is no, but wouldn't it be funny if they screwed that up?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the Philosopher's Stone.... harry potter and the Philosopher's Stone... heh heh heh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><i>The goal of the Great Work of alchemy, called also the Art, is the &quot;Philosopher's Stone&quot;. The Stone was viewed as a magical touchstone that could immediately perfect any substance or situation. The Philosopher's Stone has been associated with the Salt of the World, the Astral Body, the Elixir, and even Jesus Christ. The Elixir of the alchemists has essentially the same ability to perfect any substance. When applied to the human body, the Elixir cures diseases and restores youth. <br /><br />The alchemists' dream is to attain knowledge of the mysterious Philosopher's Stone, or &quot;that Elixir by which such wonders are performed&quot;.<br />The Stone is &quot;a blessing beyond all blessings upon earth... given to but very few, and to those few rather by revelation of the good angels of God than the proper industry of man&quot;.</i><br /><br />(Excerpt from <a href="http://www.world-mysteries.com/awr_alchemy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.world-mysteries.com/awr_alchemy.htm</a>)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Each stone is on a global Cool Down. You can have more then 1 stone for more then 1 transmute a day (or two). Or so what Worldofwar.net says. Also, no, it is not consumed. any other idiot questions?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got it for 80s from vender.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Heh.<br /><br />Sorry, I had to make the obvious reference there. But, to have some validity to my post and not make it seem like &quot;OmG ThIs ITeM IS TeH UBAr!1!1!&quot; fluff...<br /><br />How does a Philosopher's Stone relate in the real-life legends of alchemy? Every time I see alchemy, I almost always see a reference to a philosopher's stone...and since a lot of content in video games is modeled after legends and myths in real life, I was wondering what the stone was supposed to have done in the alchemy myths.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the cooldown is global for all alchemist recipes that require it, and even worse, its 48hour for all of them if you do arcanite</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For those of you interested in the history of the Philosopher's Stone, it was a magical substance or stone that, when added to a chemical reaction, sped it up/enhanced it without being used up itself. Sound familiar? Grade 10 chemistry anyone? It was a Catalyst, the first formally discovered. They couldn't explain how it enhanced the transmutation yet wasn't consumed itself, so they assigned magical properties to it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This thing isn't consumed in the process of transmuting is it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am not to the level yet but where can I find the recipe to make one?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Iron to Gold resulted in a 24 hour cooldown.<br /><br />Mithril to Truesilver resulted in 48 hour cooldown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Roininish</b></h3>While there's great discussion on what the Philosopher's Stone is and some really great lore, a lot of people want to know where to get the recipe.<br /><br />You get it in Gaget<br /><br /><a href="/classic/item=9303/recipe-philosophers-stone">Recipe: Philosopher's Stone</a>#comments</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SharkROAR</b></h3>If you are visiting this page looking for a way to get this Item for your TWW Thamaturgy: Instead of grinding Classic Alchemy to get this particular Stone, do the following:<br /><br />Get 3 Golden Lotus (Cheap on AH), train Pandaren Alchemy (e.g. in Klaxxi'vess) and learn the Zen Alchemist Stone recipe. Craft that one instead. Much cheaper and works just as well.</div>
