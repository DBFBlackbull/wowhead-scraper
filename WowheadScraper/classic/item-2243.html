I agree, somewhat.

In instances, MOST stay back and heal, and avoid meleeing entirely. And while soloing and PVPing, most go feral if they're going to melee.\n\nSo yes, I would say that although this is a good weapon for druids, and maybe priests (don't know how often they melee, but I NEVER see them do it in instances), shamans and paladins would get way, way more use out of it.

Also ... if you can use it in moonkin, I have seen posts saying the proc gets wasted on instants ... does shifting out of moonkin count as one of these instants it gets used up on?  If so it would only work for damage instants not healing, unless I meleed out of moonkin form.

It makes the next spell you cast within the next 4 seconds after proc'ing instant cast. This includes everything from Lightning Bolt to your Hearthstone. The only thing I know it doesn't make instant are thrown grenades and the like.<br /><br />Most players take the proc as the spell needs a 4 second or less cast time to be instant, when it doesn't. Any spell becomes instant cast, but the buff only lasts for 4 seconds.<br /><br />I've heard that if it procs it'll instant cap AB flags, but I haven't tested it myself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5637</b></h3>This item will be Main-Hand only in the Burning Crusade. Unfortunate for the to-be dual wielding shaman.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5519</b></h3>This used to make all kinds of stuff instant. Mounting and battleground flag caps for example but I guess most of them are now fixed. No idea if it still can be used for anything else than spells...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Falcore</b></h3>In the expansion this weapon is changed from One-Hand to Mainhand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9590</b></h3>This is a GREAT item for anyone who can use one-handed maces and is a caster. However, it is VERY expensive, i've seen prices up to 800g for this thing. If you have the time or money and really want this, go for it. But if you're level 57, you might want to wait until 60 and get an item from one of the endgame instances.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elementra</b></h3>Currently this weapon proc is not functioning correctly. It appears as if it will only take 2 seconds off cast time.<br /><br />Not to mention it procs about once every 5-6 fights.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This weapon does NOT proc near as much as people are suggesting I would say you would get about 1 proc in 50 seconds of straight swinging with windfury.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; After multiple hours of testing and calculating (Yes thousands upon thousands of hits) I find that the proc rate is 2.5%, actually my results show a 2.7% proc rate but chances are blizzard isn't going to be that specific and I just got extra lucky.<br /><br />Hope that helps everyone decide if they want to dish out the 2000g for this weapon or not.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The 4-sec &quot;Focus&quot; buff on proc is no longer used up by instant-cast spells as of the last patch.&nbsp; Very happy about that.&nbsp; Now whenever it procs I will cast Stormstrike for the 20% nature damage bonus, cast instant lightning bolt, then follow up with an earth shock.&nbsp; Can be a devastating 3-sec burst of damage, esp. if one of the spells crits.<br /><br />All in all, a great fix that I never expected Blizz to make.&nbsp; Great weapon, worth spending my 1200g life savings on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This dropped in Garona off a trash mob in Molten Core. I am a paladin and have had it for several days so let me answer some of the quesitons that people here are asking. First of all you do get notified when you are supposed to cast the spell, the proc gives you a buff called focus which is what you're looking for. Another thing I want to comment is the proc rate. Although most people are happy with the rate a few on here said that it wasnt that great... I should slap you. As a paladin with seal of crusader this mace has a 1.14 attack speed and having it proc 3-4 times back to back on one mob does not shock me anymore, for it is not uncommon in the least. Overall I am very happy with this weapon, and when I am running a 5man or 10man or even 20man I often just smack the MA target and watch the instant heals go off. If you have any questions are play on Garona send Aranir a tell and ill help ya out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Haha, the first thing i tested when i got it was instant Heartstone, and it worked! ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this one in Winterspring from a Chillwind. :)<br />(was doing some Wintersaber Trainers rep.)<br /><br />very nice mace.<br /><br />Gave it to a guildmate.<br />i know i could have got alot of money for it on my realm(Khadgar), but ill prefer to make a guildmate happy instead of making myself happy with money i waste on stuff anyways xD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Any body got a link for good mod to use with this wep so i dont miss the instant cast please?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Having had the mace on my shaman for a level now, here are my experiences. <br /><br />The proc rate is nothing special. It can proc 2-3 times during a fight, or no times at all. Nice when it happens, but nothing to rely on. You'll die if you wait for it to proc so you can instacast that 2k heal.<br /><br />Being a fast weapon, it loses durability fast, and I saw my repair costs bumped up a bit.<br /><br />There is a very small window when the Focus procs (4 or 5 seconds, I think), and it's easily missed. Get ScrollingCombatText from Curse-gaming.com, edit the sct_event_config.lua. I edited the nightfall-part (my warlock doesn't have nightfall) with the following line:<br /><br /> = {name=&quot;*** FOCUS ***&quot;, search=&quot;You gain Focus&quot;, r=256/256, g=256/256, b=256/256, ismsg=1, soundwave=&quot;Interface\\AddOns\\sct\\ding.wav&quot;},<br /><br />You'll also have to put a wave-file called &quot;ding.wav&quot; inside the sct-folder. Also adjust the placement of messages using /sct menu. This will put the words *** FOCUS *** with big letters on the middle of the screen, accompanied by a sound.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase (550g and 150-200g for +30 spell power).. throwing out 1.5k chain lightning crits in AV is lovely. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you want maby the best BoE item you can find in the entire WoW, this is it. <br /><br />Bought it from a nice friend for 900g. Usually sells for 1600-2000g on my server. (haumarush)<br /><br />I can outlast almost anyone in PvP now, its a great fun weapon to use for both paldins and shamans :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Paladins and shamans definetly have the win on this one. Not that I don't like druids, but I don't really want to waste 45.0 DPS on a druid that will not be attacking as much. Shamans probably need this more than paladins, but for paladin tanks the proc is incredible. Usually they can't throw in heals to themselves, but with the proc it would be wack, wack, boosh-wack, wack. And also auto matic hammer of wrath makes me drool. Druids on the otherhand, you are third in line for this. Its stats ARE good, but I think you should just chill. Moonkin form would benefit from this, but for the restoration druids, really what the hell do you want with this?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Kaino, 60 paladin Aggramar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>does this have a proc per minute or a proc on per hit? it would seem like it would be on hit with the speed being so high, it appears as though it might be the fast one-handed mace in the game</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I always thought chance on hit was melee. Does this also proc on spell hits?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bought this straight out of the trade channel for 750G and I can't say enough about it. :) It prots almost once a fight, sometimes up to 3 times. As a 60 Pally it's very nice for tanking (which I hate to do but still) and healing alike (so long as you don't steal aggro from the tank(s)). The only two real spells you'll be using a pally with it our holy light and wraith. But this can be extremely helpful in almost any situation, esspecially against undead. Definately worth the gold. :) I can only imagine how much more powerful it would be in the hands of a shammy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dude first learn to play your class then post, thats a shammy weapon a paly can use it too but the shammys get more benefit using that mace, windfury increase your dps a lot and when it procs its useful for an instan heal or an instan cl or cheap mana lighting, and for the paly that said he owned 2 rogues and a warrior dont lie dude.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It went to the best warrior? What a waste. That should definitely go to a Shaman or Paladin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What's the chance that this drops twice for the same guild?<br />Well, Northern alliance on Ravencrest have had it :&gt;, first dropped from some $%^&amp; some time ago in scholo and the second one today from a flamewaker elite, GG :&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How about Druid -&gt; Shaman -&gt; Paladin?<br /><br />Druids are healing oriented.. Shamans got instant offensive spells and for self heal they got the fast Healing Waves.<br /><br />Druids are support healers with Healing Touch at 3.5 sec cast.. With Omen of Clarity plus this proc we would get a free instant Healing Touch.. Outweighs an instant Holy Light or Healing Wave since Shamans are melee hybrids where as Druids are healing hybrids. You got Windfury, give us this weapon.. Kthxbye!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I use Hand as my 1H and because of the poor proc notification I use a mod called ProcWatch which I set up to notify me onscreen when Hand procs. The text you need it to notify on is &quot;You gain Focus&quot;.<br /><br />In general it's a fantastic weapon but all too easy to waste the proc on an instant shock spell during frantic combat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got it on my pally, but i only use it in instance raids... Farming and pvp i use two hand... And also for a pally in MC it dosent proc at all almost. You just stand and heal so it dosent proc unless you hit boss/mob for mana regen. It it procs then, you have so little mana that its almost useless...<br />I almost regret i didnt sell it :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Im just a bit confused. When it says &quot;Within 4 seconds&quot; does it mean a casting time within 4 seconds or that the buff lasts 4 seconds?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped last night in a fun run in MC off of a trash mob Molten Giant, I believe). Got it with a high roll in loser's lotto, and put +55 healing on it, since I've already got an Aurastone Hammer with +22 int for endurance healing.<br /><br />Anyway, after playing around with it for 30 minutes and getting six procs, I'm very pleased with this mace, and when I put it on with my full +healing gear, I'm up to +481 healing. Insta-cast Healing Light is great, but I think the best thing about this mace (on a paladin) is how, during fights that turn out to be endurance fights, this could really be a life saver. Judge Wisdom or Light on your target, then cast Seal of the Crusader = 1.14 seconds/swing. Superfast mana/heal regen - especially if you have at least 3 pieces of your tier 1 armor on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a paladin with the mace. It is good for holy light as people have said previously but also for holy wrath if fighting undead, but (of course) if I use wrath it will break sheep and shackle. Very useful for soloing, sometimes procs twice in a fight. I respecced to a 1H/shield spec not long after I got this.<br /><br />In a raid scenario I do not think it is not a good mace for a priest since the proc is on hit; I agree it might be good for soloing I suppose.<br /><br />For info mine dropped in upper BRS from the mobs between rend and the beast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I agree with half the people in here;<br /><br />Horde drop -&gt; Shaman<br />Allie drop -&gt; Paladin<br /><br />If they don't roll on it, I would let druids have the next go and priests after that. I know that both those classes *could* use it, but the previous two are going to use it more. Also, it's not up to one person who will get it (unless you have it master looter and the ml is a bias cancer^&amp;*!@), it's what the raid has to say and what the rolls have to say.<br /><br />From a shammie point of view, druids should understand you only get NS every 5 minutes. Unless I am a main healer or in some place like MC or BWL, I will be up beside the tank smacking the mobs. If it procs, free heal on anyone who needs it without having to be bothered with being slowed down by getting hit. And if I don't need to heal anyone, I just hit Lightning Bolt because it's the cheapest way to add an extra 500dmg.<br /><br />All hypothetical though, if this dropped, I wouldn't be bothered to roll on it because there is usually an Enhancement/Elemental shaman who can use it more than me for damage dealing. If no one needs, I would roll and sell to guild, 250g. Out of guild gets the fair price of 1000g.</div>

Right now I'm a 30/0/21. NS is useful at times, but wondering if Flurry would actually be more useful. Crits+Flurry+WF=Proc more often. If you could let me know if you think NS is still very useful for endgame raids, pve, and some pvp that would be great.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First off, I do more DPS against melee with this mace and my Unmoveable Object Shield than I do with my Unstoppable Force. I'm Prot/Holy and I do a lot of PvP and this mace let me kill 2 rogues and a warrior in while guarding LM in AB without help. I just judged light on rogue #1 and then used seal of light the rest of the way. Constant holy shields brought me to 70% chance to block, 100% chance extra attack when critted, constant stuns, a mana pot, a BOP with bandage, Barov Peasant Caller, about five instant cast heals, and a layon for the win. I wish I would have had those three on vent just to taunt the bejesus out of em. But with any other pally, any type of ranged attack and I would have been toast.<br /><br />I bought this mace for 400g from an old guild-mate and that one experience made it worth every copper. If you can afford it, buy it the second someone has it in AH or spamming the trade channel.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I very much want this as a Druid. When I'm healing and there isn't much AoE, I'm in the middle of the fight with everybody else adding Melee Damage.<br /><br />The chance of a NS:Heal Effect without the cooldown really sounds nice.<br /><br />Even more, the chance for an IC Starfire in PvP is awesome -- if I can get it and have time to play around (test) some, it might even convince me to respec to Balance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone who thinks this would be a waste on a priest doesn't really have much of a clue or plays on a pve server.<br /><br />Since I can't actually kite anything (trinket = gg fear) I have no option but to always be in melee range when fighting rogues/warriors. And you can't tell me an insta cast 3k heal isn't greatly beneficial (or maybe an insta cast smite/holy fire for some added dps if the fight is going well). <br /><br />In fact I would almost go so far as to say priest has priority over a shaman on this (actually I would just say that to troll, but I'll give you the reason anyways). Shamans already have good dps with shocks (instant) and can use NS if they have spec'd that way (I don't even have the option). But like I said, I would just be purposly trolling. <br /><br />I'd have no prob losing this to a shaman, druids I don't know if they still get procs when shapeshifted (If they don't then stay away from this mace). And any rogue that rolls, wins and equipes this needs to be tossed into a mental hospital and pumped full of thorazin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>All of you who say druids &quot;never melee in caster&quot; are idiots. I always melee in caster in instances unless there is a chance I can die from AoE. I know there is no way I can pull aggro in caster form by attacking, so whenevr I'm not healing, I am gonna be throwing a little DPS in to help out even that little bit. This is faster than my +healing mace and I would gladly one hand this over any other +healing mace, even in MC when I am Main Heal I migth go in and melee got example when against the Surgers who knock you back every 15 seconds, so if I can get another instance 2.5k dmg heal, well hey, why the hell aren't you giving it to me? I could save your sorry ass with this thing. Think about that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It just dropped in MC for my guild, and I was up for loot :D. The proc rate isn't too high, but considering the very fast speed, Windfury, and the Flurry talent, it procs nicely :). The sucker's basically a free Nature's Swiftness every time!<br /><br />To those saying it's good for a priest... you do realize it's a melee proc? If you're melee'ing something you're either a) /oom, and your group is screwed anyway; b) someone's in your face in pvp and you're gonna be dead any second; or c) flippin' crazy. Druids rank a little better, but if they're meleeing they are a lot better off in bear or cat form... neither of which consider weapon damage or procs. There's only two classes which can use this weapon to it's fullest: paladins and shamans.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Shamans get Clearcast Pom, does same thing, 15secs to cast 100% less mana next spell.<br /><br />I think this is more a shaman/pali wep then druid wep. WF Means more chance for wep to procs, and culd use it for so many good things. Ever druid I see tends to stand back and heal, or use there bear form to attack and since it wouldnt proc in bear form I dont see any use for a druid having this.<br /><br />Pali culd use this to cast an instant heal aswell.<br /><br />But what ever.<br /><br />For anyone that does have this does it proc very often?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Haha. Dropped in Strath/Baron yesterday and our Pally had d/c'd like 15 minutes ago. I was Master Loot and said that me and the druid should roll on it. One idiot Hunter who was guildless cliamed that he would use it if he got it rofl and everyone else was demanding that it be a free roll. I eventually decided that me and the druid roll on it and i got 66 then he rolled 50 :P I honestly dont melee that much but now that i've got this I will definitely be getting my mace skill up. It will be useless in MC/Ony But for everything else im sure my group would rather have an extra instant prayer of healing rather than the little bit of extra dps i would contribute from getting my wand out. It has some nice stats increases as well and at the end of the day it's an epic so i will look elite when i carry it around.<br />This is definitely more of a Paladins weapon, if he hadn't dc'd i might have passed on it entirely.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't see why not being able to switch weapons and keep the insta-cast proc makes the item worthless, slap a +30 spell damage enchant on it an you are good to go. It is hard to argue with the ability to insta-cast chainlightning or a heal. If you are shaman, windfury makes the weapon even better.<br /><br />If you are shaman, there are three procs you can get on this weapon with enchantments:<br />1. the focus proc<br />2. windfury<br />3. crusader, lifestealing, fiery, etc.<br /><br />Three procs on a weapon, with stats and good dps (though the crits aren't as hot...) is nothing to scoff at.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Obvious druid shammy weapon. Too bad the only two that have dropped so far on our servers are equipped by priests. What a waste</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>By the way, for everyone saying that a druid or priest has the right to roll on this... I agree, somewhat. But to be honest, I, as a level 60 druid, would only roll on it if the paladin in my group was okay with it, and the same would go for shamans if I was horde.<br /><br />I don't know about priests, but MOST druids don't melee in caster form at this level, and if they do, it's not enough to get enough use out of the proc. In instances, MOST stay back and heal, and avoid meleeing entirely. And while soloing and PVPing, most go feral if they're going to melee.<br /><br />So yes, I would say that although this is a good weapon for druids, and maybe priests (don't know how often they melee, but I NEVER see them do it in instances), shamans and paladins would get way, way more use out of it. To tell the truth, if I was a shaman or a paladin and lost it to a priest or druid, I would be slightly annoyed. It's not that all four classes can't use it, it's that two of them would get MORE use from it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Though it may seem hard to believe, as a rogue, i would DEFINETLY not only roll on this item, but i would pay upwards of 1000g for it. If you failed to notice, this is the fastest 1h mace in the game. As a mace spec'ed rogue, this would not only increase my overall dps (currently using Mug o' hurt at level 60), but would increase my chances of procing poisons and Mace Spec. Stuns. Doesnt matter what the stats are, this mace is the best off hand in the game for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well, i'm going to put my neck on te line here and say only the shamsn and pally's should roll on it. the proc is uselss for a priest, as we should never, ever, get into combat. as for a druid, it is debatable, as if you're in combat you're going to be shifted so no chance for a proc. must admit it looks tasty. priests should stick to Garr's, thats my aim anyway, as the chances of me getting anathma are slim</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This mace is Awesome I just got +22 Int on it too, I've had it proc 5 times in one fight before, though it doesn't proc as often as that usually. I was in a 15 man UBRS group when I got it. <br /><br />The group had 4 shaman, a druid, priests and 2/3 rogues one of the shaman passed O_o the other two rolled and I got a 99, Even the rogues passed, not the 'It has high dps' crap this time ^^. <br /><br />The only bad points are it's very high speed and that it doesn't notify proccing other than a flash of light around your player (ofcourse it shows the buff though) this doesn't help in a crowd though.<br /><br />EDIT: Here's my Profile<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jul 28 18:14:53 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Not all Shamans have flurry.....<br /><br />I know my role in instances, I heal. Matter of fact, I was in an UBRS group with 2 priests, one healed 20% of the damage, the other healed 25% of the damge, I healed 46% of the damage. <br /><br />But, that does not mean I would not get use out of this mace. I melee when I am solo, and this would help while I am soloing and farming. It would also help any priest or druid while they were doing the same thing. <br /><br />It really annoys me when someone say's &quot;This is clearly a &quot;insert class here&quot; weapon&quot;</div>

Also ... if you can use it in moonkin, I have seen posts saying the proc gets wasted on instants ... does shifting out of moonkin count as one of these instants it gets used up on? If so it would only work for damage instants not healing, unless I meleed out of moonkin form. Please help if you know anything :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this weapon has druid written all over it. of course i say that because i am one, but even so imagine this combined with omen of clarity. instant cast with no cost, which would be best in my opinion for healing (group members, solo'ing, dueling, etc), instant full life at no cost (of course you have natures quickness, but not if you're balance/feral)<br /><br />also good in a group situation because i find myself meleeing as well quite often, unless there's major aoe going on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Im a druid and just got this. To be honest its more a shaman or druid weapon then anything else.<br /><br />Its really nice for soloing when farming and its nice for pvp when it procs. I dont think it procs very often in pvp anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this months ago in Eastern Plaguelands from a level 59 Dark Adept. Solo grinding, and as a Paladin I decided to keep it.<br /><br />Don't use it much anymore, it sits in my inventory along side my shield collecting dust. Two handed weapons are almost a necessity in PVP, and also no reason to use a one hander inside instances when im not going to be tanking or off tanking anything. Sometimes I throw it and my shield on when I'm going to be healing/cleansing all day. Beating on mobs with it while im healing anyway, at least I can get a couple instant heals out of it.<br /><br />Would be nice if the proc didn't get wasted half the time though. By the time I realize it has proced and actually go to use a spell, it's over half the time anyway. The other half, while I'm in the middle of switching seals or blessings or whatever it procs and is wasted on an instant seal (which is already instant to begin with). Kind of dissappointing, but what can you do?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>&quot;In fact I would almost go so far as to say priest has priority over a shaman on this (actually I would just say that to troll, but I'll give you the reason anyways). Shamans already have good dps with shocks (instant) and can use NS if they have spec'd that way (I don't even have the option).&quot;<br /><br />its like a mage outrolling a priest on an item that has +healing and magical damage on it. a priest would only melee occasionally in PvP because of the pvp trinket. in pve, its worthless. same as the item i mentioned before... mages would use the magic damage but have no use for the healing increase. i'd say shaman -&gt; paladin -&gt; druid -&gt; priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's a bind on equip, meaning it's a random world drop, not drop from one specific guy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have to disagree with those who say its proc is good for paladin. Mostly because almost all the paladin spells have the lowest casting time of all. The only spell by a Paladin that takes the longest casting times are Turn Undead and Holy Wrath. There is Holy Light with 4 seconds, but most competent paladins have Spiritual Focus and use the combination of Blessing of Light + Flash of Light for quick healing. Almost all the paladins other spells are already Instant Cast. This is coming from a lvl 60 Paladin mind you, I would prefer increased chance of spell crit for spells like Holy Light for Illumination bonus and Exorcism against Undead targets.<br /><br />Personally, I be more focused on giving this weapon to a Shaman, Druid, or Priest. Especially a Priest above all else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's bind on equip so its worth a good deal of cash in AH. I'd roll with any class because im selfish.<br /><br />:D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a 60 priest on a pvp server, I dont see this weapon getting much use from a priest in high end pve (molten core / onyxia).<br /><br />However, what i do see, is this weapon getting used alot in solo pvp (vs rogue and warrior specifically). Vs a good rogue, the only spell you can hope to get off is an instant cast one. That means renew (heal over time), shield, shadowword: pain, so what is a <u>non shadow spec</u> priest going to be doing whenever he/she isnt refreshing those 3 instant cast spells? Meleeing of course. Btw please dont mention fear, any good rogue would know that priest fear is a joke these days. Having this weapon proc vs a rogue would be a guaranteed win for the priest with an instant cast greater heal.<br /><br />If that wasnt enough, imagine an instant cast mind control, nuff said.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>An oxymoron, I know, Paladin Tanking, but it's actually very very useful. I know from my experiences it procs like mad. I've gone into fights and had it proc two or three times. I genuinely can rely on it to proc at least once per fight. It's nice for paladins who HAVE to tank or offtank because it's got a good, fast attack speed, nice 1H damage, and the proc chance. The +int is nice too because of how all-important intellect is for the tanking paladin. I even went so far as to add an additional +22 intellect to it.<br /><br />This is my favorite paladin tanking weapon because the proc allows instant, uninterruptable heals in case things are going sour. Also, if you're... say... assaulting Thunder Bluff when you get bored one evening and find yourself surrounded by hunters and rooted by a druid, it's nice to watch it activate and hit your hearthstone to instantly be whisked away to the safety of Ironforge.</div>

Look at item proc: Chance on Hit. How many hits are u goin to do playing priest/druid character in instance? I can say when i use that mace it procs 1 time during 100-200 strike. Now tell me how many hours do druid/priest need to deal 150 strikes as average. So dont shake the air around claimin about it's proc.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't know if the arguement is moot at this point or not, but I think that a moonkin druid has as much claim to this weapon as pallies or shamans. It has good stats and an amazing proc that does work in moonkin form. With the armor bonus of the moonkin form, this weapon makes it viable to be a melee caster in moonkin form for several reasons. In moonkin form, the druid can really become a melee-combat/caster class built on procs:<br /><br />1. The Omen of Clarity melee proc<br />2. The Edward the odd proc<br />3. Nature's Grace casting proc<br />4. Starfire stun proc<br /><br />I really believe that druids do have a legitimate claim to use this weapon. It might not be as perfect for a druid as it can be for a shaman or maybe even a paladin, but it still a good druid weapon. To say that druids don't melee in high end raiding is not a great arguement against them using it because paladins don't do a ton of melee in high end raiding either (by that I mean BWL and MC). I don't know much about shamans high end though, so I won't comment on them.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Feb 28 14:57:59 2006</div>
