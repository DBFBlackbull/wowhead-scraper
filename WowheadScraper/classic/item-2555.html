When leveling your alchemy try making as many swiftness pots as possible. Very useful in pvp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8661</b></h3>A low level potion maybe, and I never really used it myself, However, I have found myself famring these for my guild. <br /><br />Before a BWL or AQ20 run, I circle saround darkshore for about an hour in travel form and grab every briarthorn and mageroyal I can in hopes of getting enough swiftthistle. I then make up 4 stacks and hand a stack to each tank.<br /><br />In BWL they will be used to kite around the humaniods, and in AQ20 they will be used to drag Buru and Ossirian arond the rooms. <br /><br />This is a VERY valuable potion in raids, and i hear of people never leaving home without them for soloing. I just happen to have dash and travel form so I don't use them myself :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8748</b></h3>this potion is very useful if you play warsong gulch alot, if your an alchemist or if you just wanna run fast alot. if your an alchemist then you should make the potion alot and put it on AH</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The reason to that this can be expensive is that a lot of people need this for PvP, mainly Warsong Gulch I'd say to make it easier to capture the flag.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the recipe as a drop in Wailing Caverns. I think it is a random world drop and farming an area where someone else found it will not give you any special advantage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I soloed WC as a 35 Warrior and had this drop. Auctioneer said it had sold a few times for 50g so I decided to throw it up in the AH for 40g...50g BO. It sold within 2 hours :). Because of that, now I can afford a mount :). For those that complain about the price, think about it, it's a very rare world drop. I was the only one at the time selling it in the AH and the big thing is...once you buy it you'll make up the money selling the pots in no-time...they are in high demand. I will certainly be buying them on the AH for BGs and world PVP.</div>

Don't you know allahs #1 function is telling you where to get things at the top of the page? People who are noobs on WoW typically are noobs in RL apparently. This is a world drop, you can't farm for it. In essence, because of the practicallity of the potion, and despite its alch req of 60, it has the drop rate of an epic. i repeat its a WORLD drop. it can not be farmed anywhere by anyone on any mobs. the only way to get this is right place right time or cough up the cash on the AH.</div>

Reading here would make it seem this is a great money making venture, but after some time it will not be. On my server this runs for under 25s. I bought it for 5s. The potions go for 15-30s. But since an alt makes swift boots, it's worth it for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think this is a very handy recipe, and even more if you are an alchemist. Have you guys read what it allows you to make? SWIFTNESS POTIONS... and that makes you go 50% faster! That really is handy, for mountless players. It dropped for me in the Barrens, and I felt lucky, but in fact I was looking for another recipe, the &quot;savory delight&quot; one, which has a little higher drop chance but didn't drop (and I tried for two days...). So I called it a day and left. Anyway I dont think Im gonna sell it, althoug if I run poor I already know what to do... :P<br /><br />PS: stop in$%^&amp;ing each other, it's stupid!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mozi</b></h3>Being early days in the Classic WoW servers means you can find some pretty good bargains. I just got this of the AH in Hydraxian Waterlords EU server for a little bit over 1 gold.<br /><br /> Granted, we are still in Phase 1, but this baby and the potions will go up in value from Phase 2 onward. Try to grab it now cheap!</div>
