It's just like the 7.5 ticks over 15 sec, because here, you don't know if the card procs before or after a tick. \n\nI got confused reading about X, Y, in5sr and the numbers 100 and 50.

The other mana classes will regenerate 65 mana\/tick (http:\/\/www.wowwiki.com\/Formulas:Mana_Regen)\n\n2.5 procs * 7.5 ticks * 75 mana =  1406 mana - priest\/mage\n2.5 procs * 7.5 ticks * 65 mana =  1219 mana - all the others\n\nThere you have it. This is for a player with 250 spirit at 100% mana regeneration. I don't think mana regeneration can stack to more than 100%, if you have talents plus the card and what ever. Keep in mind that this is for constantly casting a 2.5 sec spell over a period of 4 min and 10 sec.

The general rule of thumb is if you have 300+ spirit that this card pulls ahead over the long term.   Be aware though that the % chance nature of this card makes it unreliable in that regard.   Assuming Spirit levels rise with The Burning Crusade release, I expect this card to be much better long-term than the Mindtap Talisman. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that there are a few ways to take full advantage of this trinket.

Also, if you finish a spell just before the effect ends, you don't go into the 5 second rule afterward so you're effectively extending the benefit of this trinket.

You gain somewhere between 30 and say 200 mana every tick from your spirit.\n\n2- When you are in combat (or literally, casting things), the Five Second Rule kicks in and you stop gaining mana. Your mana regeneration rate drops to zero when the Five Second Rule is on you. You can't see this \"debuff\" but it's part of the game rules- you just don't gain any mana for five seconds after you cast anything. You're at zero mana? Tough. You have to stop casting for 5 seconds and then your spirit starts trickling in more.\n\n3- What this card does is lets you override the Five Second Rule when it procs. Instead of your mana regen from spirit rate dropping to zero for 5 seconds after you cast, it stays at 100%, casting or not. This card turns off the Five Second Rule and lets you keep casting while also gaining precious mana.\n\nSo what does it mean? It means that in long, drawn out boss fights, you can keep casting and casting, and when it procs, your spirit will keep filling up your mana even while you fight and heal.\n\nThis is perfect for druids, priests, paladins and shamans casting lots of small heals in a row in big boss fights. Take Firemaw for example. Ordinarily the fight is maybe 10 minutes long, and you have to keep casting all the time to heal everyone. Firemaw&nbsp; tries to melt the face off of everyone he can see, so you have to constantly spam heals the entire fight. Someone pinned down by the five second rule would never regain any mana until their mana was out and they couldn't heal anymore. Then they wait five seconds. Then they slowly start gaining mana. Someone with this card spamming heals is going to proc the card a couple of times in ten minutes, and when they do, they start gaining mana from their spirit, ignoring the 5second rule. How much mana does your spirit restore if you were out of combat in 15 seconds? 200? 400? Maybe even 800 if your spirit is really high. In a long boss battle, every time this procs, it gently adds another 400-800 mana to your pool.&nbsp; How many other trinkets can keep doing that with no cooldown? This card is like a Second Wind that never stops.","date":"2006-01-15T04:21:29-06:00","rating":38,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"MarlanD","importedSubject":"5-Second Rule"},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":2651983,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I was led to believe that Blue Dragon procs on wands and even a TICK of a renew, but this is FALSE.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4336</b></h3>That's some fine calculations you have there. However, I have some comments. &gt;:D<br /><br />The proc rate over a time span of 250 sec and 100 heals is 2.5. This makes more sence in theory, since the chance for the card to proc gets bigger as you use more spells. It's just like the 7.5 ticks over 15 sec, because here, you don't know if the card procs before or after a tick. <br /><br />I got confused reading about X, Y, in5sr and the numbers 100 and 50. I couldn't make sence of them, and I didn't want to waste any more time looking at them. Here's my take on the situation:<br /><br />A priest/mage with 250 spirit will regenerate 75 mana/tick. The other mana classes will regenerate 65 mana/tick (<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Mana_Regen" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Mana_Regen</a>)<br /><br />2.5 procs * 7.5 ticks * 75 mana = 1406 mana - priest/mage<br />2.5 procs * 7.5 ticks * 65 mana = 1219 mana - all the others<br /><br />There you have it. This is for a player with 250 spirit at 100% mana regeneration. I don't think mana regeneration can stack to more than 100%, if you have talents plus the card and what ever. Keep in mind that this is for constantly casting a 2.5 sec spell over a period of 4 min and 10 sec. Taking breaks and casting longer spells will reduce the chance of a proc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3118</b></h3>This is the only Darkmoon card that will scale well at 70 and beyond. Get your cards/deck now while people are still farming the instances, as soon as BC comes out prices will rise OR the cards will just never show up. % based items are the only ones that will still pull their weight at 70.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8765</b></h3>At one point in time this card used to proc off of wanding and creating tradeskill items. It aslo used to stack with the 15% meditation and 3 piece transcendence bonuses, so you'd get 130% mana regeneration for the duration of the proc if you had both bonuses. Now, however, none of these work. If it procs, you get 100% mana regneration for the 15 seconds and that's it. <br /><br />People most compare it to the Mindtap Talisman out of DM West. The general rule of thumb is if you have 300+ spirit that this card pulls ahead over the long term. Be aware though that the % chance nature of this card makes it unreliable in that regard. Assuming Spirit levels rise with The Burning Crusade release, I expect this card to be much better long-term than the Mindtap Talisman. <br /><br />It should be noted that there are a few ways to take full advantage of this trinket. If you do no casting after it procs, you're really only getting 5 seconds of &quot;benefit&quot; out of the proc. That is not to say that you should just cast spells for the sake of casting them, but if anyone needs their health topped off now is the time to do it. Also, if you finish a spell just before the effect ends, you don't go into the 5 second rule afterward so you're effectively extending the benefit of this trinket. This trinket is also considered an excellent choice for people who are on decursing duties during boss fights.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9590</b></h3>This is a very useful item for casters in my opinion. It can really help in a pinch in boss fights in endgame instances. If you have the money or are willing to farm for it, definitely go for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25099</b></h3>I always hated this thing on my Priest. In fact, I totally gave up and ended up vendoring it for a few gold when TBC hit. I just found it far to random, it would proc when I didn't need it, and when it would have been life saving it never happend. Thats fine and dandy for a DPS class, but for a healer I need reliability and consistency, not unpredictability. I went with a pair of &quot;lesser&quot; trinkets, that give me reliable regen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TyrionFarseer</b></h3>Even at level 70 this trinket is very strong for a healer. A priest stacking spirit can easily regenerate over 1500 mana from a proc of Blue Dragon.<br /><br />Notably, this trinket scales with the rest of your gear, and also benefits from raid buffs (DS, Kings...). Pre-TBC I had over 600 spirit on my priest fully buffed making this trinket a veritable powerhouse - especially on fights where I was decursing.<br /><br />The trouble is making spirit work for you. You have to really pay attention to the 5-second rule, and heal in bursts.<br /><br />I'm yet to see a better mana-regen trinket for healers in long fights.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Scenerio: 5 minute fight. Assume 50% within the 5-second rule, and 348 spirit. <br /><br />Mindtap Talisman restores 660 mana in 5 minutes.<br /><br />Blue Dragon procs an average of once each boss fight (50 casts of Flash Heal * 2% proc chance). 50 FH = 19k mana used, a high but attainable number. If it does proc, 700 mana is restored. (100 mana/tick * 7 ticks). However, if it procs during a period where you aren't going to be within the FSR already, then the proc is a waste.<br /><br />So, you can get Mindtap Talisman, a blue and easily attainable in a 5-man run of DM west, or you can spend alot of time instancing random mobs and spending money on the last few cards you need to collect to create an item that does the same thing in a less predictable manner.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />If the trinket was activateable with a 5-minute cooldown, then at least it could be counted on for fights less than 5 minutes long, in periods you know you would be casting (so you can take full advantage of being within the five second rule). In that case, it would clearly be better than Mindtap Talisman and worth it's epic status. As it exists now, it's a pile of crap for being epic.<br /><br />Priests with 5/5 Meditation reduce the effectiveness of the Blue Dragon trinket as they are always regenning 15% of their mana. With 3 pieces of Transcendence, it's 30% regeneration which further makes the Blue Dragon trinket less attractive.&nbsp; Same goes for mages with Mage Armor and Arcane Meditiation.&nbsp; Therefore, to even compete with Mintap Talisman or Shard of the Scale, this trinket needs to add +100% mana regeneration instead of giving a flat 100% mana regeneration.<br /><br />I'm willing to put money on the procbuff being dispellable too, further reducing this trinket's usefulness in fights like Garr and PvP -- any situation where buffs can be dispelled.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It depends on the situation.&nbsp; First off it's entirely spirit-dependent.&nbsp; If you get more than 100 mana regen per tick from spirit then this trinket could be considered epic for you.&nbsp; For fights where I do a lot of dispels this is likely to proc more than once every 5 minutes. Including dispels I easily do more than 50 spells every 5 minutes vs. say, Baron Geddon.&nbsp; <br /><br />Furthermore, atm it procs on everything that could be considered a &quot;spell&quot; including wands and creating items.&nbsp; For a non shadowpriest that makes it a powerful item for soloing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Let's review the basics. <br /><br />1-Spirit gives you mana back if you haven't cast any spells in a while. You gain somewhere between 30 and say 200 mana every tick from your spirit.<br /><br />2- When you are in combat (or literally, casting things), the Five Second Rule kicks in and you stop gaining mana. Your mana regeneration rate drops to zero when the Five Second Rule is on you. You can't see this &quot;debuff&quot; but it's part of the game rules- you just don't gain any mana for five seconds after you cast anything. You're at zero mana? Tough. You have to stop casting for 5 seconds and then your spirit starts trickling in more.<br /><br />3- What this card does is lets you override the Five Second Rule when it procs. Instead of your mana regen from spirit rate dropping to zero for 5 seconds after you cast, it stays at 100%, casting or not. This card turns off the Five Second Rule and lets you keep casting while also gaining precious mana.<br /><br />So what does it mean? It means that in long, drawn out boss fights, you can keep casting and casting, and when it procs, your spirit will keep filling up your mana even while you fight and heal.<br /><br />This is perfect for druids, priests, paladins and shamans casting lots of small heals in a row in big boss fights. Take Firemaw for example. Ordinarily the fight is maybe 10 minutes long, and you have to keep casting all the time to heal everyone. Firemaw&nbsp; tries to melt the face off of everyone he can see, so you have to constantly spam heals the entire fight. Someone pinned down by the five second rule would never regain any mana until their mana was out and they couldn't heal anymore. Then they wait five seconds. Then they slowly start gaining mana. Someone with this card spamming heals is going to proc the card a couple of times in ten minutes, and when they do, they start gaining mana from their spirit, ignoring the 5second rule. How much mana does your spirit restore if you were out of combat in 15 seconds? 200? 400? Maybe even 800 if your spirit is really high. In a long boss battle, every time this procs, it gently adds another 400-800 mana to your pool.&nbsp; How many other trinkets can keep doing that with no cooldown? This card is like a Second Wind that never stops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was led to believe that Blue Dragon procs on wands and even a TICK of a renew, but this is FALSE. It does, however, proc on in the initial cast of a renew, as well as other instants such as shield, inner fire, fortitude, etc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay,<br /><br />Here comes the maths:<br /><br /> - When spamming spells you have a fairly constant probability of this trinket being up.&nbsp; The probability is: 1-(98%)^(15/spell speed)<br /><br /> - This is the probability that one of your spells in the last 15 seconds would have tringered the trinket.<br /><br /> - this means that spamming a 1.5 spell gives you a 18% chance of having this trinket up at any given moment.<br /><br /> - With a spirit of 300, you should have an OOC regen of about 188 mana/5 sec.&nbsp; Therefore, you will effectively gain 18% * 188 = about 34mana/5secs while spamming a 1.5 spell.<br /><br /> - Priests need to remember to remove 15% from any of these figures if they have meditation.<br /><br /> - When spamming 2.5 spells this goes down to 22mana/5sec, while when spamming instant spells this goes up to 49mana/5secs<br /><br /> - therefore, as long as you have a high spirit and plan on spamming spells in end-game content, this trinket is excellent!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>okay,<br />there is a lot of debte as to the usefulness of this trinket.<br /><br />I will make the assumption that your are spamming spells with around a 1.5s casting time as this is what I usually do on my paladin - either cleansing or FoL healing.<br /><br />At any one point in time we need to know the probability of the trinket being up. We do this by working out the probability that the trinket did not fire in the last 15 secinds, then 1- that number is or probabiliy.<br /><br />If you cast 10 spells at 1.5s per cast in the last 15 seconds, the probability of the trinket not being up is 0.98 * 0.98 * ... * 0.98 or 0.98 to the power of 10 = 0.817.&nbsp; Therefore the probability of the trinket being up is 0.183.<br /><br />Spirit regen with 250 Spi is 13 + (Spi / 4), or 75.5 mana / 2s or 188.75 mana / 5s.<br /><br />Therefore, on average you will be regenning 188.75 * 0.183 = 34.52 mana / 5s<br /><br />This is much more than mindtap or even double the onyxia trinket (that I almost fell into the trap of bidding DKP on the other day - thank you maths!).&nbsp; That is only looking at my raid buffed Spi which is usually between 250 and 300 - imagine this on a fully spi buffed priest and you will realise the power...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>TalShuler's math is correct about the 18.3% average regen with 1.5s casting, but with one addition.&nbsp; At the begining of a fight, boss or otherwise, the chance that the proc fired in the last 15 seconds is zero.&nbsp; You can discount this over the long run, but 10 casts is significant for short fights.<br /><br />On first cast, the chance is 1-(0.98^1)=2%.&nbsp; On second cast, 1-(0.98^2)=4%.&nbsp; And so on...<br />Cast&nbsp; % Active&nbsp; &nbsp; Average Regen<br />1st&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.0%<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.0%<br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.9%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.9%<br />4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.8%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.9%<br />5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.6%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.8%<br />6&nbsp; &nbsp; 11.1%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.8%<br />7&nbsp; &nbsp; 13.2%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.7%<br />8&nbsp; &nbsp; 14.9%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8.6%<br />9&nbsp; &nbsp; 16.7%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.5%<br />10&nbsp; &nbsp; 18.3%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10.4%<br />11&nbsp; &nbsp; 18.3%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.1%<br />12&nbsp; &nbsp; 18.3%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.7%<br /><br />This means that after 10 casts, you're averaging 10.4% regen over the entire fight (averaged 1-10).&nbsp; (The rest of this is specific to me, a shaman with 224 unbuffed spirit and 6600 mana). The most I estimate I can keep up is around 18 consecutive casts... gives 13.9% average regen.&nbsp; With my spirit, that puts me at 21.5 average MP5.<br /><br />But, if you have to pause due to fear, changing targets, etc. your % regen rate decreases to 2% within 15 seconds.<br /><br />For me to beat Mindtap, I have to cast 7 consecutive casts.&nbsp; Shard of the Scale takes 10 consecutive casts.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>One thing you have to realize is this. As a mage, single cast spells like frostbolt or fireball only cast once and take mana on succesfull cast (end of channeling.) Spells like blizzard and arcane missles have multiple chances of finishing a cast, as they are doing multiple points of damage. I remember reading blizzard alone has 4-5 chances of proc'ing something.<br /><br />Best way to look at it is with Clearcasting. (10% chance of proc for your next spell to have mana cost reduced by 100%) Sometimes it will happen right away with AM or Blizz, other times mid channeling.<br /><br />If same holds true, great item IMO. If any of my thoughts here are not correct, by all means please correct.</div>

Proc % in WoW doesn't necessarily work the way many of you seem to think.<br /><br />There are -many- trinkets in WoW with a 2% proc chance, heck, look at the trinket that has a 2% chance to increase attributes by 25, and that goes off very often.<br /><br />Many of you seem to be taking the general consensus that low % proc items are somehow automatically divided by a raw number and a guaranteed proc.<br /><br />Do you really think that the trinket will proc only once every 50 heals? I challenge any of you to say yes after the first week of August, because I guarantee you that you are wrong.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Blue Dragon or mindtap? The answer is simple.<br /><br />If you have high spirit (200+) this is better. If you have low spirit (&lt; 150).<br /><br />A proc on this means an extra 500-750 mana if you take full advantage of the proc.<br /><br />To use this well, do the following. When you are low/out of mana wand with a fast wand. Once the blue dragon procs (yes wands proc it), cast all you can for 10-15 seconds (anything past 10 seconds will put you in no-spirit land for a bit).<br /><br />However, for an epic, it should be a higher % Proc. A mindtap is so much easier to get and almost as good, sometimes better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd like to ask you if it is possible to equip 2 different darkmoon cards for example: <br /><br />Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon<br />AND<br />Darkmoon Card: Twisting Nether<br /><br />I know they're unique but thats for the exact same card isnt it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Flash heal may be only a 1.5 sec cast, but it costs 380 mana. Ratio that out and if it were a 2.5 cast it would cost 633.3E mana.<br /><br />On a mage your Frostbolts {2.5 cast of course} only cost 260. So a mage will be casting a LOT more, and since a mage is pure damage (as opposed to healing every now and then) they'll be casting continuously and it will proc MUCH more on a mage in long fights (where it's actually useful) such as Onyxia.<br /><br />So.....Definitely a <b>mage</b> item <i>:)</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm normally using the DM priest trinket + the onyxia shard.<br /> I've had this trinket for quite a while though and tonight I tested it.<br /> I replaced the shard.<br /> We were doing an AQ40 run and it didn't procc more than max 2 times before the twins (about 3hrs raidtime). <br /> I was just saying in our priestchannel how worthless it was but I kept it on for the twinsfight. It procced 5 or 6 times during that fight (a ~15 mins fight) and regenerated more mana for me than the shard ever would.<br /><br />I'm still not sure if I should use it or not. Seems you have to be a bit lucky with the proccs for it to pay off.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I one of the better guilds in the EU and pretty much all our priests have this now. <br /><br />We have done excessive testing which involves using it on various raids, pvp and boss's such as ragnaros and razergore (we have them on farm).<br /><br />In MC it procs for me countless times. I have duel mindtaps usually, the mana regen from them is good, but u do not feel it, however when aura of blue dragon procs it is 3 flash heals within 5secs, also if it procs when u are about to rest on healing rotation, the mana regen is huge, esp with a soulkeeper with +20 sprit (hitting 350 to 360 spirit +15% talent regen). <br /><br />For someone who hasnt got much money and doesnt raid the whole of MC, duel mind taps are alot better, but this truely is the hand of justice of casters (HoJ being sword spec rogues or any warriors best friend)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, this thing really needs a buff to state itself epic. Now it just removes the 5s spirit penalty.<br /><br />4% proc to get 150% manaregen and 100% manaregen while casting. Like Innervate but a very nerfed Innervate.<br /><br />Only then would it become epic in my book.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Oct 10 06:20:19 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Regardless of gear the proc-chance on this is way to low to replace a mindtap/shard.<br />Dont waste any gold in getting this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Basically, if your amount of spirit sucks, this card will suck for you. Since it just allows you to have normal mana regen while casting for 15 seconds (plus any bonuses such as Meditation and 3-piece Trans bonus for a priest, to 130% regen), this item goes off of your spirit.<br /><br />It's great for priests with high-end gear, and I'm sure druids with proper talents and 3-piece Stormrage would like it too. But for mages, warlocks, or any other mana-using class for which spirit is a limited attribute, you're most likely not going to see an &quot;epic-quality&quot; proc from this trinket since when it procs you won't regen near as much as someone with alot more spirit and regen bonuses.<br /><br />It says it has a 2% proc rate, but after spam testing for an hour one day I discovered that it's more like a 4% proc rate, which is fairly often given the number of insta-casts such as Renew that someone will be using in a raid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK, I have this card. It DOES have to ability to proc with instant casts, as some people have asked, I have had it go off with Moonfire and Rejuvenation. <br /><br />It has a 2% chance to proc each cast. You have to take each cast as a seperate event, you can't just say &quot;if I cast it 50 times it is bound to go off&quot;. No. It may go off every time. Or it may not go off at all for 500 casts. After saying that though, I have found that is usually procs every third or fourth spell cast.<br /><br />I have found that it is an awesome little trinket for higher end instances, as when it goes off, my mana is regenerating while I am still throwing a heal on the MT = more mana to throw around during the fight.<br /><br />I got about 4 of the cards in drops, including the elusive Ace from The Beast (also got Finkle's Skinner at the same time, skinned the beast and got Pristine Hide of the Beast, yay for me!) so it only cost me about 25g in total. Completely worth it in my opinion.<br /><br />Hope this cleared up some issues.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Apr 29 10:27:35 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This trinket seems like it was designed for priests, but..<br />The proc % is too low imho, its only use is in a pve enviroment during a boss encounter. And even then, a chance of 2% is not something to rely on.<br />Maybe if you could get 2, but its unique.. a mistake.<br />Overal, the effort to collect all cards to get this is not worth the trouble.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Jul 15 09:29:24 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is not a Mage Trinket its a Priest Trinket.<br />Flashheal only has a Casttime of 1.5 sek so it procs every 75 sec.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>during the magmadar encounter i use about 30k mana .. mostly flash heals and renew with a ratio of 3:1. i guess the trinket would proc 1-3 times. with my current spirit setup i would get 1400 mana per proc. mindtap talisman regenerates about 1000 mana in this encouter. but i still wonder whether it stacks with meditation.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think this card is really good for Boss fights - that's the only time I equip it. But for those fights it is simply awesome.<br /><br />For example during long fights such as Hakkar, it'll typically proc 4-6 times adding up to 2400-3600 mana.<br /><br />For trash mobs, or general fighting I don't use it but during end games boss fights it really shines!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Profits</b></h3>Does not have an ICD. I've had it proc and then proc again while the first proc was still active.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>XiZ0r</b></h3>As a paladin in classic I figured I'd give this a go as the BiS items up until p6 has a lot of spirit on them. This paired with spirit being an unused stat. <br /><br />Going with the previous calculations of roughly a 1/5 uptime it's a bit hit or miss.<br /><br />On paper it looks fantastic with full bwl gear around 27mp5. In reality it is really unreliable, but so is crit for paladin.<br /><br />Sure try this out if it fits your playstyle (FoL spamming). But don't expect miracles. <br /><br />I'm still going to use it but if you have doubts I wouldn't recommend.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lakiozoon</b></h3>If I land a spell just before the Aura of the Blue Dragon ends, will I still remain out of 5sr after it ends?<br /><br />Did some observations on my mana ticks and it seems that:<br />1. You get out of 5sr instantly when it procs.<br />2. Once the buff ends you will enter the 5sr depending when your last spell was cast (even during the aura).<br /><br />So there really is no way to play with it (extending it) using Inner Focus once it ends:/<br /><br />Do correct me if i'm wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>webphut74</b></h3>I love mine. I have weak auras 2 set up to show me when it turns on.

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
