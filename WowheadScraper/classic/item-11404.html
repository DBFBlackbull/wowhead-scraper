These didn't drop a lot of eyes, and also often yielded thick leather instead of rugged leather. In addition, the poison debuff they give make you walk slower, having to remove poison all the time to farm faster was annoying.\n\nMoved on to [i]Monstrous Plaguebats[\/i]. These have slightly more health, and have silence, so is not recommended if you are a spellcaster. But as a melee they were better for me, they yielded more eyes, and gave me rugged leathers. The downside is that they're somewhat spread out.\n\nNext up: [i]Plaguebats[\/i]. There are a few downsides here: The first is that they have a screech that fears you for 3 seconds. This happened about once, 50% of the fights. The second is that they are also object of a quest, so in peak hours you might have a lot of competition. Also, the droprate seemed to be a bit worse than the Monstrous version. The upside is that there a lot of them, and the sheer amount of them made up for that, especially since I was skinning them. Though these also give a combination of thick and rugged leather.\n\n[b]To sum up: It was a decent farm, as long as I was skinning.[\/b] I used the rugged leather for rugged armor kits (more tickets), and made the thick leather into nightscape tunics to vendor. I preferred the Plaguebats and Monstrous Plaguebats. On off hours, Plaguebats might be better. Droprate for eyes with the Noxious bats might usually be better than what I had, a longer farm is needed to make sure. But with the slow debuff, I think I'd skip them anyway.\n\n[b]I personally do not recommend this farm for Evil Bat Eyes alone[\/b], there are probably many better farms for gold, which would make buying the eyes an better option.\n\nFarm time: 2 - 2 1\/2 hours.\nEyes: About 10\/hour. Would be more if I didn't skin, but not substantially.\nGold from vendor greys: About 7g, after repair. Also got 2 greens (4,2g if vendor).\nSkinning: About 100 rugged leather, 60 or so thick leather. 10 hides.\n\nHope this was somewhat helpful, have an enjoyable Darkmoon Faire!","date":"2020-02-11T07:30:49-06:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2020-02-13T19:36:25-06:00",2,"7ammerheart"]}];

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Monsterous Plaque bats I find are better for mele classes since their only ability is a silencing one.&nbsp; The Noxious bats have a DOT poison and slowing poison which are very annoying (esp for rogues) and only slow your farming down.<br /><br />Skinners &amp; LW can kill two birds with one stone using the Monsterous as well.&nbsp; Not only do they have a chance to drop the eyes, but can also be skinned for rugged leather (and in turn the armor kit turn-in) 40 Rugged Leather or 10 bat eyes = 1 turn in = 20 tickets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>do not do the same mistake as i did! do no waste time on killin these bats! evil bat eye is as good as glowing scorpid blood, but has a MUCH lower droprate!<br /><br />save your time, and travel to silithus where the blood drops 25% off the scorpions!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dunno. About 2 months ago, I could go get 10 eyes in 30-40 minutes on my 60 mage. I'm lucky if I get 3 in that time span now.&nbsp; Has the drop rate been nerfed again? Maybe I've hit a run of back luck the last 4 days. Gonna try the scorpids in Silithus. Although, I don't recall the drop rate being tremendous there either.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>from my experience, if you want darkmoon rep, start with getting as many vibrant plumes as you can before you max out from your rep. then stick to farming scorpids in silithus for the blood rather than bat eyes. make no mistake though, it will be alot of farming.<br /><br />Edited, Thu May 18 01:43:20 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Then just sell those plumes for a ton of cash, which you can then use to buy Scorp Blood and Bat Eyes. And the Scorps are much easier to farm. They have a higher drop rate and are more concentrated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LW's get to farm these and scorpids, pick up Rugged leather for armor kit turn ins...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This seems to be a joke.<br /><br />After being farming vibrant plumes for days i realize that you can just deliver some before your faction goes high enough you cannot deliver anymore, so big time wasted.<br /><br />When i go to farm evil bat eyes, soon i discover that after installing wowvid and watching two movies while farming bats in western plaguelands, 3 hours, i ONLY get 15 evil bat eyes.<br /><br />Should i quit farming? I understand that the final point of this game is blizzard's interest in getting players play and play more to get their money, but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />Maybe i have to buy all the series of tarzan :-P, farm while watching all of them and still i would have 1/10th of the tickets necessary for the amulet. <br /><br />Ok, i will do it ! :D :-P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ShaunDreclin</b></h3>Vendor trash until Darkmoon Faire is added</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7ammerheart</b></h3>Darkmoon faire is open, so I decided to farm some bats.<br /><br />Started out with <i>Noxious Plaguebats</i>. These didn't drop a lot of eyes, and also often yielded thick leather instead of rugged leather. In addition, the poison debuff they give make you walk slower, having to remove poison all the time to farm faster was annoying.<br /><br />Moved on to <i>Monstrous Plaguebats</i>. These have slightly more health, and have silence, so is not recommended if you are a spellcaster. But as a melee they were better for me, they yielded more eyes, and gave me rugged leathers. The downside is that they're somewhat spread out.<br /><br />Next up: <i>Plaguebats</i>. There are a few downsides here: The first is that they have a screech that fears you for 3 seconds. This happened about once, 50% of the fights. The second is that they are also object of a quest, so in peak hours you might have a lot of competition. Also, the droprate seemed to be a bit worse than the Monstrous version. The upside is that there a lot of them, and the sheer amount of them made up for that, especially since I was skinning them. Though these also give a combination of thick and rugged leather.<br /><br /><b>To sum up: It was a decent farm, as long as I was skinning.</b> I used the rugged leather for rugged armor kits (more tickets), and made the thick leather into nightscape tunics to vendor. I preferred the Plaguebats and Monstrous Plaguebats. On off hours, Plaguebats might be better. Droprate for eyes with the Noxious bats might usually be better than what I had, a longer farm is needed to make sure. But with the slow debuff, I think I'd skip them anyway.<br /><br /><b>I personally do not recommend this farm for Evil Bat Eyes alone</b>, there are probably many better farms for gold, which would make buying the eyes an better option.<br /><br />Farm time: 2 - 2 1/2 hours.<br />Eyes: About 10/hour. Would be more if I didn't skin, but not substantially.<br />Gold from vendor greys: About 7g, after repair. Also got 2 greens (4,2g if vendor).<br />Skinning: About 100 rugged leather, 60 or so thick leather. 10 hides.<br /><br />Hope this was somewhat helpful, have an enjoyable Darkmoon Faire!</div>
