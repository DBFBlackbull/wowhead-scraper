The vendor that sells it is on a small outcropping on the ocean in Azshara. Some have reported that it only takes 20 minutes for this to spawn, but I waited over two hours before finally giving up. Your best bet is try in the early morning (or very late at night).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Like any other difficult vendor, you just have to camp the little bastard for a few. I bought his other pattern and just waited, it took about 20 mins or so.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have seen both recipes vendored at the same time.&nbsp; I would not expect buying one to get the other to be valid with this having been observed.&nbsp; However, shortly after I saw both items vendored at the same time, one of them disappeared and I was the only one present.&nbsp; Good Luck with this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i worked on getting this pattern for a few days....in the end, it came down to luck and following the advice of some of these posts.&nbsp; i finally found the chimerac pattern, and bought 2 of them, to buy it out. i then had to talk to him a few times before the blue dragonscale pattern appeared.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can't get this pattern, I've bought two of the chimeric patterns, and still no sign of the Dragonscale pattern.&nbsp; /cry</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've bought 4 chimeric patterns and still no sight of the BP =(&nbsp; Anyone know how this vendor thing works?<br /><br />-Edit: Recieved it after the fourth pattern was bought.&nbsp; I think the restock time is 30 mins and it is random what he restocks with.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I checked about 4 times over a few days and finally found it there....didn't have to buy any other pattern there first, and didn't have any high level recipes in my inventory...hope that helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>that buying of the other lw pattern is bull*!@# first, i cant imagine why blizzard whould do something like that....<br /><br />i walked to the seller, he didnt had it, waited 15 mins and he had the dragonscale pattern.<br /><br />What the person above had with buying the other first is just luck, prolly someone bought both before him and both had the same cd left with a few secs difference. He bought the other pattern which respawned first, then the dragonscale pattern respawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>exactly where in Azshara can I find this guy?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the 2 npcs&nbsp; one engineerring sells deep dive helm and other 2 leather working patern and tailoring supplies is in azshara&nbsp; over looking The Ruined Reaches&nbsp; you comein&nbsp; smack between the bluscalebanes and the giants (ohh fun) a small path leads down to em from the tops of the cliff. there in a gnome hut .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just confirming.&nbsp; No patterns were there when I arrived... I sat in front of him for 15-20 minutes checking for the pattern every minute.&nbsp; Both patterns appeared at the same time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It does not seem necessary to actually purchase the Chimeric pattern from this guy prior to the dragonscale appearing.&nbsp; There must be some window of opportunity where it becomes available.&nbsp; It appears that there is some logic built into the game where if you buy one pattern, another will show up in about 7 minutes or so, if you purchase the second it can take upwards of 20 minutes for the pattern to show up again.&nbsp; But I have found little consistentcy in how things appear, I think it is a roll based drop after a given period of time... so hopefully you are just simply lucky enough to be around at the right time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive been camped here for a week, bought the tribal form and he hasnt had any form since</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been flying to Azshara every day for the last 5 days.&nbsp; I've bought the tribal piece, and it sold in AH for a descent amount.&nbsp; Just now when I logged in, I flew in, and went to the vendor, and there it was, a Pattern: Blue Dragonscale Breastplate.&nbsp; You just need to be patient.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I camped there for another 20 min, and another Pattern: Blue Dragonscale Breastplate cam along.&nbsp; I waited for about another 40 min to see and no more.&nbsp; So i bought the tribal one too and sold that as soon as I got to Ogrimmar.&nbsp; It covered the cost of buying all three patterns.&nbsp; Now lets see how much will Pattern: Blue Dragonscale Breastplate sell for in AH.&nbsp; BTW, I went in the morning, around 4am server time.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Baught it in Gad AH for 95s, not even a leather worker but figured a guildie could use it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I only waited about 15 mins when it appeared I managed to buy it twice, this will make me some good money on ah selling the pattern and making the armor :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I visited this guy many times over the course of days, but he never had it. Today I decided to just camp and wait for it. I bought the Deepdive Helmet thing, and waited like 15min,then this&nbsp; popped. It seems a lot of people say it popped after 15-20 minutes of waiting...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>no mystery to it - it depends on who gets there first - my first time and I got it... if someone else gets there first, it's gone... 1 per day...<br />you can also get the schematic for the deepdive helmet there from his wife...<br /><br />another thing that helps is to get away from the vicinity - go somewhere - I came back like 10 mins later, and they were there - but I once left it there for like 1 hour and nothing...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm not gonna say anything like &quot;This guy don't stock it&quot; or &quot;It doesn't spawn&quot; because so many people have said they had it off him...<br /><br />However... is the respawn time days, weeks or months? Just curious!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>no way is the respawn on this days. ive just got 2 within an hour. id say the respawn is 30 minuits or so<br /><br />wonder how much this'll go for in AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, so I log in with my alt to get the flight path in Azshara.&nbsp; I figure, while I'm here, check for the Breastplate right?&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; So I work my way down, through the folks who want to kill me, and check.&nbsp; Bing!&nbsp; It is there!&nbsp; But I notice I don't have the 2.58g (or however much it costs) that I need!&nbsp; So, I log on my hunter (who needed the pattern anyway).&nbsp; She is in Silithus, but hearths to Gadgetzan.&nbsp; So off she goes.&nbsp; With the new flight paths, it still took her forever to get there, but not as long as it would have.&nbsp; So she lands, hops on her tiger, and rides to the little guy but Eh?&nbsp; Chimeric gloves pattern!&nbsp; WTH?&nbsp; So I close the dialog window.&nbsp; But then I'm thinking, meh, buy it anyway, so I do...but then they are gone.&nbsp; Like that quick.<br /><br />Anyway...camp 'im is all I can suggest.&nbsp; Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the DS pattern after 10 min or so... When I came he only had the chimeric one, and so I waited... My luck<br /><br />I reckon the restock time is longer than your lowlevel Item, if its anything like the green DS pattern. I spend days getting that one... <br /><br />Anyhoo good luck to you<br /><br />the guy is at 45,90</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Arrived and no breastplate pattern but there was one pattern for chimeric gloves - bought this to sell. Then checked on Jubia and bought one deepdive helmet paatern. Went off to kill some blue dragonkin, came back in ten minutes, one more deepdive helmet pattern was there. Also bought this. went to kill more dragonkin. Got killed. Rezzed. Came back and one more Chimeric gloves pattern had appeared. Bought this. Went to kill more dragonkin. Ten minutes later came back and there it was - one blue dragonscale breastplate pattern. Bought it. went out. It hadn't appeared in my bag - went back in and checked if i'd made a mistake and another chimeric had appeared. Bought this and both appeared in my bag. I just hope all this stuff sells for something close to the price I paid for it all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I suspect the patterns pop one after the next because the previous visitor bought them both one after the next... suggesting both patterns use the same duration timer.</div>

About 7 minutes later he had another one, 10 minutes later the Chimeric Gloves, which costs 1g20 and sells about 3g.<br /><br />The lady had the Deepdive Helmet schematic.
