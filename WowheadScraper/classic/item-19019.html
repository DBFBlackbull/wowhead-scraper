The raid has has to deal with a remarkable lower amount of damage on the tank and consequently there is less healing needed.\n\nThis debuff is the reason why warriors of the top guilds like Nihilum or DnT still use this weapon...provided that they got it.","date":"2007-03-17T11:49:23-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2007-09-25T02:31:21-05:00",2,"Skyfire"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":15,"id":58556,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"14808","body":"No, the TF affect and Thunder Clap don't stack.","date":"2007-03-28T10:30:10-05:00","rating":279,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":16,"id":71959,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"44372","body":"I am offhanding TF on my combat rogue and while yes the 1.9 speed does lower the chance for combat potency procs, the large amount of unmitigated damage from the TF proc makes up for this.

I thought I'd do what I can to clear some of it up, and make a post actually worth reading.\n\n[b]Loot priority[\/b]\nFirst and foremost. This is obviously rogue\/warrior first. In almost all cases, your raid is far better served having this on a warrior than on a rogue. It is also more effective for dps on a warrior than it is on a rogue, since rogues rely on sinister strike (goes off weapon damage) for dps. Dual wield (fury) warriors rarely use abilities that go off weapon damage, making this ideal. There are a number of weapons in-game currently from naxx that are upgrades from Thunderfury for a rogue, however this is still the top dps (and hence, tanking) weapon in the game for a warrior.\n\n[b]Threat generation[\/b]\nIt's probably a bad idea to give this to DPS class if you don't already have a tank with one, due to the threat generation of the proc effect. Every proc from a Thunderfury generates threat equivalent to two applications of [i]Sunder Armor[\/i]. This is why it will help a tank retain aggro very well. The proc that bounces to 4 targets does [i]not[\/i] break CC such as sheep, sap, etc. It does generate threat on them, at the value of over 1\/2 of an application of Sunder Armor.\n\n[b]Farming the mats[\/b]\nGenerally, a guild will supply a player on this quest with the Fiery Cores and Elementium Ore, as these are acquired through raiding. You will be expected to supply the 100 Arcanite Bars and 30 Elemental Flux yourself. \n\n[b]Thunderfury and The Burning Crusade[\/b]\nIn TBC, improved thunderclap is being upgraded so that it's effect reduces the attack speed of the afflicted by 20% (bringing it in line with the Thunderfury debuff). This will help players upgrade to better weapons without being pressed to continue using Thunderfury for the debuff. It's extremely likely that epic drops at level 70 will out-class it.\n\n[b]Actual DPS[\/b]\nTaking the proc effect into account, Thunderfury is an ~85 DPS weapon. However, it's important to note that a large portion of this dps (the proc) does not scale with gear. This means that as a player reaches higher and higher levels of AP\/crit, Thunderfury becomes less effective. This also makes it good for a tank - a tank's AP\/crit scales at a much slower rate than a DPS class (tank gear focuses on stam\/armor\/avoidance\/defense). \n\n[b]Thunderfury proc crits[\/b]\nThe Thunderfury proc does crit, but very rarely. The crit chance is based off a player's spell critical chance, rather than melee. Effectively, when unbuffed a warrior\/rogue's spell critical chance should be 0%. With buffs, this moves up slightly. Certain buffs that increase spell critical chance have a noticable effect on the Thunderfury proc, such as the Onyxia buff, and the buff gained when fighting Loatheb.","date":"2006-09-19T08:00:20-05:00","rating":66,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"xarg","importedSubject":"Thunderfury: Facts not fiction"},{"commentv2":1,"number":23,"id":2721448,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Numidia","body":"...

Look at last patch and all the caster items they added. Don't open your mouth if you don't know what you are talking about.

If [i]anything[\/i] is given +damage\/healing, it detracts from the stam\/int it could normally have, effectively neutering our damage.\n\nThis means that while casters pretty much have to give themselves a +damage set that screws their stam and int for PvP that's different from their PvE switch, you will rarely see a physical attack class have a different switch unless they have a wild spec, such as pure crit %, that would be total suicide in an instance.  It pretty much boils down to a mana pool.\n\nOh, and uh...so this is on topic, nice sword.  I think flair is really BS, it's just superficial and has no real use, like those women who buy those freakin mega$$$ prada purposes that can barely hold a napkin.

The Debuff lowers NR and decreases attack speed.  In essence it lets allows the healers to heal 20% less ( = less mana usage) on the MT.  People dont realize since more then 50% of this weapons DPS is derived from the proc and Nature damage it is a rare sword that DOESN\"T depend on Gear to be useful.  That means when a rogue upgrades his attack power\/agi\/%crit and strength, 50% of that melee dps stats is not effected by the usefulness of Thunderfury.  Now take a tanks gears into consideration.  He gets tier 1 and upgrades to tier 2.  ALL the tanks gears are damage reduction and higher HP based.  Guess what... since 50% of the sword's damage comes from the proc that means the warrior doesn't have to have uber DPS stats to make good use of the sword becuase its Proc isn't based on physical DPS based.  This doesn't mean a rogue can't make good use of this sword.  It just means that Rogues can get swords with higher Top end damage that are more effective as they get better gear.  Tanking warriors don't focus on these stats so a sword that derives 50% of its damage through a proc is an ideal tanking sword.  This explaination should let Guild leaders know how to distribute the

It's got good dps, it's 9 foot long, and has a paragraph proc.  Oh, and an orange name.  You want it SOOOOO bad!  The girls will want to be with you and the guys will want to be you.\n\nYes.  It is awesome.  But is it worth it...?\n\nIt took me 8 months, 2 guilds, and 10k gold.  But the price you pay doesnt end there, and Im not talking about the 4.5g repair bills on it alone either.\n\nFor every 1 compliment you get, you get 3 counts of harrassment, and there are ALOT of compliments.  You can't walk anywhere with it equipped without starting\na conversation, or more likely an argument exactly like the ones here.  But onto the damage.\n\nIn 5 man dungeons, solo, and pvp, you will own.  It will be as good as you expect.  In the mainhand I get around 9 procs per minute over long term and I slice and dice fairly frequently.  In PVP it's total confusion with lightning and tornadoes hitting all thier d00dz. However, in raids, I don't notice NEARLY (repeat NEARLY) the dps boost I had expected.  Perhaps an extra 20 dps on a rough guess.  But while I was thinking about how expensive a moderate dps boost in a raid that was, I realized something.\n\nTF's main benefit is not damage.  TF's benefit is the proc.  Not the 300 (I've got a 495 max) damage.  It's the -25% attack speed.  On a raid boss, that's 25% less physical damage.  So, obviously, it does benefit the tank, but also the tanks healers, which leaves more mana for them to heal everyone else.  It doesn't matter who has the sword in the raid as far as SOMEONE has it.  \n\nThe argument about causing way too much aggro gain is like most of the arguments about Thunderfury.  They're made by people who haven't used one.  I've noticed very little increase in nasty aggro situations and certainly nothing uncontrollable.  \n\nIn regards to the Off Hand\/Main Hand argument.  Anything short of a Grand Marshal's sword, Main hand it.  Period.  Don't care about your math, Ive tested it long term.\n\nSo, in conclusion:  Guilds should open up to the idea of a rogue having it.  I'd say it's benefitted my guild just as much as if the tank had gotten it and Im sure they'd agree.\n\nIf I could go back and had the choice to bid on that first binding again, would I?  No.  I would pass on it.  The effort put in is not worth the end result, in my opinion.","date":"2006-12-17T05:48:52-06:00","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Casmin","importedSubject":"Thunderfury on my Rogue:  Retrospect"},{"commentv2":1,"number":153,"id":3071631,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Beastly weapon, has great skills and also has some awesome stuff","date":"2007-03-22T23:05:31-05:00","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"WoWmanAddict","importedSubject":"You find this that great? well hell ya!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":154,"id":3071632,"nreplies":10,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Guess it'll be nice for warrs and pallys, but useless for rogues. \n\nNot worth the effort :\/","date":"2005-07-07T03:19:20-05:00","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Why is this useless for a Rogue?","creationdate":"2005-07-07T03:26:29-05:00","id":1281712,"rating":3,"commentid":3071632,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"jamesjiao","importedSubject":"Why"},{"body":"Having 115 max damage, 1.9 speed, and it being main hand only kind of pooches it for combat rogues.

Yes, the sword is a quest reward. A reward for the quest where you need to kill Thunderaan. And to summon Thunderaan you need both bindings of windseeker and 10 elementium bars and some other nice crap. So, there will be no \"ninjaing this thing from Thunderaan\" nor any n00b rogues with this weapon. No worries there.\n\n2. It's definitely a weapon for a tank. It couldn't be any more tanky even if the words \"For tanks\" were written on it. Also, checking the dps and max damage, no pvp warrior would specifically want this weapon either. The proc is awesome for both pvp and pve, but for pvp there are other very good 1handers that are easier to get.\n\n3. Thunderaan is very easy to kill. I was there when my guild did it. We were a full 40-man raid just because everyone wanted to see the boss, but I'm sure it'd go down with like.. 10 people. Very easy with a few good healers and a good tank. I'd say a load easier than most MC bosses. Thunderaan obviously does nature damage, so if you are having problems (which I would find weird), drink a few nature resist potions. All that Thunderaan manages to do is hit the MT and use some weird multitarget lightning bolt that does something like 1k+ damage. I'm guessing it also has some melee hit that sends one flying, since I saw some guildies fly in air.\n\n4. I doubt any server will see much rogues or paladins with this weapon. It clearly requires a LOT of work to get, and any guild that gets one will surely give it to their MT. Only if they get a second or third one, I could see a rogue or paladin getting it. I doubt there are any pvp-oriented guilds that even have this weapon.

(Although single target this weapon is legendary quality for a rogue or anyone else, from what I've heard about the procc rate)\n\nEverything else in this thread is either wrong, skewed, upside down or backwards. One cute example is the attack power in relation to weapon speed diagnosis.\n\nSince the servers are down and I've got nothing to do, I'll correct you, poor misguided uncle's son.\n\nAttack power functions this way, for everyone: 14 attack power translates to 1 dps. So if you're swinging a weapon with 1.0 speed 14 attack power is going to give you 1 extra dmg per swing (assuming your target has 0% armor reduction). Continuing on, if you're swinging a weapon with 4.0 speed and you have 1400 attack power you're getting 100 DPS, and if you're swinging a weapon with 1.0 speed and you have the same attack power, guess how much DPS you're getting? 100 (That's okay you'll get it next time, I'm sure). The only difference is that you'll be getting 400 damage a swing from your attack power with the 4.0 speed weapon and 100 damage a swing with the 1.0.\n\nIn short: you're wrong, Attack power translates to the same net damage (on auto-swing, for instant attacks slower weapons will receive a bigger boost from attack power) regardless of weapon speed.\n\nSomeone else (who demonstrated correct understanding of the effect of attack power) said that Ashbringer is bad for Mortal Striking. Quite the hilarious statement considering Ashbringer is a 489 top end Two handed sword with a 4.0 speed off Nefarious. You meant Thunderfury is bad for MSing, and it's clearly intended to be used for heroic striking.\n\nGreat warrior weapon, decent rogue weapon. Paladins and hunters aren't real people. They're zombies.\n\nEdited, Tue Jul 26 15:14:59 2005","date":"2005-07-26T19:00:15-05:00","rating":-15,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Your analysis of the damage dealt per swing is great but it neglects to consider that as a rogue only 30-40% of my damage comes from normal mellee.

There you will find that at times there are many more then 5 mobs in your face at any given time.  Also people should note that the proc AOE effect is a debuff and causes no damage in and of itself.  Pretty much anyone who attacks one of those mobs will still draw the agro as it takes almost no damage to draw more agro then debuffs. So dont think the proc is going to steal mobs from other tanks.

Have you never been in a guild where the MT actually had Tfury? I've seen a guild with 7. Every single one of the people who had it was a tank. (With the exception of 1, who was a rogue). There's a reason the weapon proc slows down enemy attack speed, and I'll tell you this, its not so the rogue has to dodge less. End of Story, Tanking weapon. Level 70 Prot warriors still prefer Tfury over any other tanking weapon, no matter what its top end dmg is, because the procc holds a hell of alot more aggro than anyone thinks it does, and ontop of that, it procs on enemies who are CC'd, and doesn't break CC. As in, you sheep 2 targets and seduce 2, the tank's proc will hit the guy he's tanking, and the 4 others next to him, thus gaining aggro on 5 mobs at once, without breaking CC. And like I said, its a damn good amount of aggro for it being a simple weapon proc.\n\nTanking weapon mainly, so shut it rogues, you get plenty of &*!@ thats much better, you just want it because its orange. As for pallies, well, I haven't seen much pally action before TBC, but as of 70, i've seen pallies tank as well as warriors, so in what i've seen, they're a viable player to recieve one, as long as they're protection specc (or whatever its called for pallies)\n\nThis comes from a priest who's seen just about every instance out there (including naxx).

My dream. It's absolutely beautiful. For anyone who thinks otherwise, here's a few examples.\n\nProtection-based warrior: IMO this sword would sit best with a protection Warrior. The aim of a protection warrior are mainly just to hold mobs and provide support to other classes, right? Right. Not only does this sword massly decrease the nature defense of enemies, making your Druid and Shaman teammates do more damage, not only does it lower an enemies attack speed making you take less damage, but it also hits, in effect, 6 enemies. This is basically an area-effect taunt. It would not only do great damage to 5 enemies near you and lure them, but it would also do mass damage to the enemy you target, basically buff druids and shammies, and is 1-handed. It's also quick, meaning you could keep steady threat being generated and increase the effect of the talent and defense-stance given threat bonuses. It's absolutely best suited to a defense warrior, I believe.\n\nRogue: Rogue have poisons, poisons are nature damage. Buff yourself.\n\nHunters: Hunters also have nature damage. Same as above.\n\nPaladins: Paladins have a lot of useful things that effect lots of enemies, such as auras. Once again, like Protection Warriors, it would make a lot of enemies want to attack you, making you the main focus of the area, and also lure a lot of them to attacking your nice little Aura of Retribution.\n\nOverall, I think this sword is best for Protection types, but it's really good for any class that can get it. You'd have to be careful however, as it could also work against you if you're in a large place where there's lots of enemies, and you have a number of tanks who each take a couple of enemies, since you could unwittingly attract more enemies than intended. Likewise for Hunter and Rogue, you could pull enemies that haven't been aggro'd by anyone yet. Due to this, you'd have to take serious caution with this weapon, and maybe even put it away during certain battles where you can't afford to attract too many enemies.\n\nBut all in all GOD I want one.","date":"2005-07-08T19:03:12-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"\"+ 16 - 30 Nature Damage\" IS NOT THE SAME AS \"Increases damage done by Nature spells and effects by to 16 to 30\".\n\nCome on people, use your head (or heads if you're a 2 headed ogre).","creationdate":"2005-07-08T22:35:49-05:00","id":1281808,"rating":1,"commentid":3071729,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"kyouin","importedSubject":"RE: Beautiful"},{"body":"I know that, I was referring to the fact that it lowers enemy's nature resistance.

They do however still inflict extra damage in the amount specified in the tooltips. This is not noted in the combat log separately and is simply calculated as additional physical damage added to the weapon’s attack.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it has been noticed by players that when using an elemental barrier such as a nature\/frost\/fire protection potion or a shield that absorbs a specific element, you will see an “absorbed (X)” message in the combat log. This is also correct and working as expected, and such effects will reduce the damage of attacks by such weapons by the amount of extra elemental damage specified in the weapon tooltip.\r\n\r\nUltimately the way these weapons function is a very old quirk\/bug with how original World of Warcraft was built. While definitely strange and unintuitive, these weapons are behaving exactly as they did in the original game and we have no intention of changing them to behave differently in WoW Classic.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps provide some clarity around this very odd quirk inherent to these types of weapons!\"[\/i]\r\n[code]Blizzard post: https:\/\/us.forums.blizzard.com\/en\/wow\/t\/weapons-with-frost-damage-or-any-other-school-dont-work\/569190\/6[\/code]\r\n[code]Wowhead post: https:\/\/classic.wowhead.com\/news=316707\/blizzard-clarifies-that-extra-elemental-damage-from-weapons-is-working-as-intend[\/code]","date":"2020-07-05T05:39:00-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":301,"id":3216874,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"hengeveld1","body":"Do people still get this passionate about WOW anymore?

The proc does generate quite a lot of threat, but it is nothing too unmanageable for a Rogue to negate through the usage of Feint and Vanish.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to get the Bindings due to the fact that we already had a Warrior with Thunderfury already.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jerree</b></h3>The warrior/rogue debate has now become a moot point, being this close to TBC release.<br /><br />While this weapon will grab aggro on clusters of mobs, a rogue shouldn't be able to grab boss aggro from a good prot warrior. TBC is featuring far better, non-legendary, weapons for Tanks and as thus, this weapon can safely be given to a rogue.<br /><br />To strengthen this point. Once a Tank gets his hands on a +def weapon doing 89 DPS, he'll never again use his TF in PVE. Therefore, the raid just lost the proc... In this case, if a rogue had it, they could continue to off-hand it to keep the proc around for the guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skitzosmeagol</b></h3>Understand though, should a main tank get this weapon, he will generate more threat and allow in turn the whole raid to do more dps without the risk of pulling aggro, sure giving it to a rogue is understandeable, there is no problem with that. The guild decides who it goes to. However i feel the tanks will be able to generate more threat, and allow everyone else to do more DPS. Btw this weapon is amazing at DPS and threat generation!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7391</b></h3>I don't know who'd actually even consider crafting it now, with TBC around the corner. The costs are pretty steep and chances are you'll replace it in the not too distant future.<br />Maybe if you have tons of gold (*coughcough*) and just want it for the shiny legenardy factor, but else... why bother.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7968</b></h3>A once very rare weapon. Now obtained by luck. I've seen warriors, rogues, paladins, and even a hunter with Thunderfury. These days most guilds are in Naxx. Warriors have Widows Remorse, rogues have other Naxx weapons. Short story; Many guilds just give this out to whoever is crazy enough to spend almost all of their DKP on it. <br /><br />The reason why a lot of warriors don't take this weapon is due to the fact that it costs a fortune to craft. Warriors already pay a buttload of money towards repairs after raids. Especially tanks. Since the sword was awarded the right to be an offhand it has become a very much wanted item by Rogues. Even though the threat from the proc is insane, most rogues can handle it. <br /><br />I've seen a paladin with this sword too, he put +22 Int on it. I lol'd.<br />Also, I'd like to warn all hunters that want this weapon... Blizzard stated themselves it was a mistake putting them on the list. I've seen 2 guilds fall apart because they awarded a hunter with a set a lucky drop binding because he was willing to spend big DKP bucks on it. Then the tanks getting mad as they wanted it over a hunter (even though they didn't speak up when the RL asked if anyone wanted it)</div>

Unless the instanse your in requires Crowd Control, but I know I would kill for this(not literally :P ). I have seen this so many times in the battlegrounds. Does Great in huge parties of people. Very helpful in taking nodes in Arathi Basin. Not as good in Warsong Gulch as in Arathi Basin, but it does well holding off troops in the base as your friend grabs the flag and slips out with the defenders trapped in the Wind proc.<br /><br /> In Alterac Vally you could do just like Arathi Basin. Maybe while Fighting Drek'Thar'Vandeer you would be holding off the Horde/Alliance Defenders WHILE tanking the evil man. <br /><br /> paladins and hunters whould never have been able to get this. i see no point in a hunter having anything with good melee. as for a paladin I mean come on you would benifiet more from +healing or +intellect than this sword with DPS and great proc.</div>

Even with our best efforts to keep the summoning of Thunderaan a secret, half the server showed up for the event, and Thunderaan died quite quickly as a result. After defeating him, you loot the Dormant Wind Kissed Blade and have the now groveling Demitrian give you Thunderfury, Blessed Sword of the Windseeker. <br /><br />Source : Allakhazam.com / wow-europe.com</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>15764</b></h3>At level 70 my warrior is unable to find a better DPS one handed weapon because of the proc on this. The proc is what makes this weapon.. While I can equip other weapons that I can hit harder with and have bigger crits with etc.. This in the main hand is far superior when aoe'ing mobs with wirlwind/cleave.. The proc hits 5 mobs that are surronding me, so between that and wirlwind/cleave, I can out DPS any geared warrior in my guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9576</b></h3>In the the latest patch (2.0.10.6448) the threat generated from the Thuderfury proc was reduced. Still good for tanking but the effect of ThunderClap has been increased and is usable in defensive stance, thus making it less neccessary for a lvl 70 tank to use/want this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>13912</b></h3>I was testing and comparing tanking weapons in the last days a lot because I really wanted to know how much impact the newest changes on my loved legendary sword have. I don't want to talk about tanking (multiple) trash mobs in Karazhan ore elsewhere it's just not worth it.<br /><br />Thunderfury is still the most powerful high-end encounter tanking weapon out there after 2.0.10. It is not only the (nerfed) average threat generation which is still a bit higher then <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/i28749">King's Defender</a> much more important is the substantial debuff which reduces the target's attack speed by 20% and makes this weapon so powerful versus melee damage intensive encounters (i.e. Gruul, Prince phase 2). The raid has has to deal with a remarkable lower amount of damage on the tank and consequently there is less healing needed.<br /><br />This debuff is the reason why warriors of the top guilds like Nihilum or DnT still use this weapon...provided that they got it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>14808</b></h3>No, the TF affect and Thunder Clap don't stack.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>44372</b></h3>I am offhanding TF on my combat rogue and while yes the 1.9 speed does lower the chance for combat potency procs, the large amount of unmitigated damage from the TF proc makes up for this. This makes TF an excellent offhand choice for rogues in TBC.<br /><br />Since the debuff does not stack with thunderclap, and TC is the same 20% slow as TF, it isn't as vital in PVE as it once was. However, a rogue with it being there alleviates the tank from having to spend rage on keeping TC up.<br /><br />In addition, the -15NR debuff helps with poison (less resists) and increases the damage from nature based casters (shaman/druid).<br /><br />In pvp it is still awesome, the 20% atk speed slow affects enemy players as well and decreases the damage taken from all physical damage dealers. This essentially means the proc turns a warrior's 3.0 speed 2hander into a 3.6 (ouch). It is too bad it doesn't increase spell cast time as well, but that's what mind numbing poison is for :-P<br /><br />As a rogue, I've found that TF is most versitile, useful, and just plain coolest weapon a rogue could have. It's sad that because of TF's overpowered tanking factor that most of them went to warriors. <br /><br />Since the addition of new, high dps tanking weapons, the threat nerf to TF, and the change to thunderclap(usable in defensive stance now), chances are you will see less and less warriors using this weapon.<br /><br />It is still a very good rogue weapon though...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>23311</b></h3>Chances are you'll see less and less Warriors wielding TF because *no one runs the instances that you have to farm to acquire one*. Seriously, who the hell is going to re-farm MC and BWL for a TF these days? I'd laugh if one of my Rogues suggested we farm one or two of these up. Hard. <br /><br />My interest in TF is only renewed by a supposed questline to upgrade it; I firmly believe this is total bull, but the possibility is still mildly tantalizing. I still doubt it'll be worth farming one up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>23311</b></h3>How do guilds working on new content have &quot;a couple of hours&quot; to farm two legendary drops that have exceptionally low drop rates?<br /><br />If the drop %s were higher, if the instances were on a one day timer, that I could see.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I wonder what it disenchants into</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My favorite side effect of having this sword is heals in BGs.&nbsp; Healers notice the sword and figure it's a good idea to heal the wielder.&nbsp; Woot!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lots of fiction here, very few facts. I thought I'd do what I can to clear some of it up, and make a post actually worth reading.<br /><br /><b>Loot priority</b><br />First and foremost. This is obviously rogue/warrior first. In almost all cases, your raid is far better served having this on a warrior than on a rogue. It is also more effective for dps on a warrior than it is on a rogue, since rogues rely on sinister strike (goes off weapon damage) for dps. Dual wield (fury) warriors rarely use abilities that go off weapon damage, making this ideal. There are a number of weapons in-game currently from naxx that are upgrades from Thunderfury for a rogue, however this is still the top dps (and hence, tanking) weapon in the game for a warrior.<br /><br /><b>Threat generation</b><br />It's probably a bad idea to give this to DPS class if you don't already have a tank with one, due to the threat generation of the proc effect. Every proc from a Thunderfury generates threat equivalent to two applications of <i>Sunder Armor</i>. This is why it will help a tank retain aggro very well. The proc that bounces to 4 targets does <i>not</i> break CC such as sheep, sap, etc. It does generate threat on them, at the value of over 1/2 of an application of Sunder Armor.<br /><br /><b>Farming the mats</b><br />Generally, a guild will supply a player on this quest with the Fiery Cores and Elementium Ore, as these are acquired through raiding. You will be expected to supply the 100 Arcanite Bars and 30 Elemental Flux yourself. <br /><br /><b>Thunderfury and The Burning Crusade</b><br />In TBC, improved thunderclap is being upgraded so that it's effect reduces the attack speed of the afflicted by 20% (bringing it in line with the Thunderfury debuff). This will help players upgrade to better weapons without being pressed to continue using Thunderfury for the debuff. It's extremely likely that epic drops at level 70 will out-class it.<br /><br /><b>Actual DPS</b><br />Taking the proc effect into account, Thunderfury is an ~85 DPS weapon. However, it's important to note that a large portion of this dps (the proc) does not scale with gear. This means that as a player reaches higher and higher levels of AP/crit, Thunderfury becomes less effective. This also makes it good for a tank - a tank's AP/crit scales at a much slower rate than a DPS class (tank gear focuses on stam/armor/avoidance/defense). <br /><br /><b>Thunderfury proc crits</b><br />The Thunderfury proc does crit, but very rarely. The crit chance is based off a player's spell critical chance, rather than melee. Effectively, when unbuffed a warrior/rogue's spell critical chance should be 0%. With buffs, this moves up slightly. Certain buffs that increase spell critical chance have a noticable effect on the Thunderfury proc, such as the Onyxia buff, and the buff gained when fighting Loatheb.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok guys just incase you havent noticed, that on every single weapon except for this, your stats work alot on the weapon. Like lets say for a warrior with a normal 1h and a shield wants a good ammount of agi and str so they can hit hard with the sword. So stats make a big difference in weapons. Well not for this. Without this proc this sword is horrible..just horrible. But the proc happens so often that it is just an amazing sword. Now..as far as i know...agi and str have nothing to do with proc rate... For a warrior...You can focus ONLY on STAM and AR. But you will still hit the same as if u focused on str and agi. If you havent caught on... this sword makes itself not your armor. Imagine a warrior with 8K+ hp with 11K+ armor and having 100 dps...ouch<br /><br />Edited, Thu Sep 8 22:11:48 2005</div>

Don't open your mouth if you don't know what you are talking about. </div><br />Casters get t3h shaftz0r...while a good melee wep can increase your damage by a lot just by its DPS count, which is factored as +damage in weapon balancing, and still have nice +stats, caster weapons only provide the same +stats are reg weapons <i>without</i> the damage bonus from the dps of the weapon, even though it is still considered into overall balancing. If <i>anything</i> is given +damage/healing, it detracts from the stam/int it could normally have, effectively neutering our damage.<br /><br />This means that while casters pretty much have to give themselves a +damage set that screws their stam and int for PvP that's different from their PvE switch, you will rarely see a physical attack class have a different switch unless they have a wild spec, such as pure crit %, that would be total suicide in an instance. It pretty much boils down to a mana pool.<br /><br />Oh, and uh...so this is on topic, nice sword. I think flair is really BS, it's just superficial and has no real use, like those women who buy those freakin mega$$$ prada purposes that can barely hold a napkin. It's not worth obtaining just to look cool; there's plenty of other weps that look pretty nice you can buy for 20g off an auction house.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Everyone knows that Thunderfury is an amazing Tanking sword. The Debuff lowers NR and decreases attack speed. In essence it lets allows the healers to heal 20% less ( = less mana usage) on the MT. People dont realize since more then 50% of this weapons DPS is derived from the proc and Nature damage it is a rare sword that DOESN&quot;T depend on Gear to be useful. That means when a rogue upgrades his attack power/agi/%crit and strength, 50% of that melee dps stats is not effected by the usefulness of Thunderfury. Now take a tanks gears into consideration. He gets tier 1 and upgrades to tier 2. ALL the tanks gears are damage reduction and higher HP based. Guess what... since 50% of the sword's damage comes from the proc that means the warrior doesn't have to have uber DPS stats to make good use of the sword becuase its Proc isn't based on physical DPS based. This doesn't mean a rogue can't make good use of this sword. It just means that Rogues can get swords with higher Top end damage that are more effective as they get better gear. Tanking warriors don't focus on these stats so a sword that derives 50% of its damage through a proc is an ideal tanking sword. This explaination should let Guild leaders know how to distribute the bindings.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I agree that it's a good sword. But, it's not THE best sword anymore. Infact it's less powerful since the BC pack!. The proc alone is weaker and doesn't even proc as much. I have said this to many people who are noob enough to still use the sword. Yes, it can still hold it's own. but there are much better weapons in the game. I'm don;t care if your the #1 warrior in the game. Thunderfury sucks compared to Kings Defender and other blade you can get from Kara and Gruuls lair. It was funny to hear a person yell at me saying I'm retarted for say Thunderfury wasn't good anymore. But it's fact. The proc has been shot down by 20% and the effect of the proc isn't even NEARLY as powerful as it was. So my thought stands. If you don;t respect about what I think then you need to stop playing the game for more than 5 hours a day and get a real life.<br /><br /><i>Edited, May 8th 2007 1:00am by KingDhaos</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You figure since it's such an elemental (nature) based weapon it should be a dagger instead of a sword, at least a shaman would have fun with it. Surely the +16-30 nature damage MIGHT apply to our shocks/lightning spells. But I agree with many others, there's trully a lack of caster based legendray type items. Blizzard needs to make something a mage/lock would die for. <br /><br />Thunderfury = Rogue, Hunter, warrior, pally weapon(let's not start class discussion, just classes who can use it period).<br />Sulfuras = Warrior, Pally, Shaman<br />Ashbringer = Warrior, Pally, Hunter<br /><br />It's saddening that there's not a single weapon for caster classes (legendary that is). Sure there's the uber high dps wand crimson shocker with over 73dps. But still that's epic and offa MC.</div>

In this case, you are asked to gather a bunch of elementium and kill ragnaros for a quest. When you do gather these items, and turn the quest in, the NPC then gives you another quest to summon Thunderaan, which is an oversized elite whirlwind elemental. Thunderaan drops a quest item called something like a dorment blade. turn this back into the NPC and you will receive Thunderfury.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd say like this about what class that should have it:<br />Hunters: You have your epic staff and you suck melee (no offens :)so I bet this won't proc ranged.<br />Warriors: You have your Quel'Serrar atleast the MT's and the DPS Warriors should rather go for Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros then this. Sure the book is a rare drop but it's easier to get then this.<br />Paladins: Not really sure why a Paladin would want this, go for Herald of Woe or Finkle's Lava Dredger instead.<br />So my point is that this is best for rogues, yes it is also good for arms warriors but rogues and paladins is the only class that doesn't have a class weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay, you're a rogue. It's got good dps, it's 9 foot long, and has a paragraph proc. Oh, and an orange name. You want it SOOOOO bad! The girls will want to be with you and the guys will want to be you.<br /><br />Yes. It is awesome. But is it worth it...?<br /><br />It took me 8 months, 2 guilds, and 10k gold. But the price you pay doesnt end there, and Im not talking about the 4.5g repair bills on it alone either.<br /><br />For every 1 compliment you get, you get 3 counts of harrassment, and there are ALOT of compliments. You can't walk anywhere with it equipped without starting<br />a conversation, or more likely an argument exactly like the ones here. But onto the damage.<br /><br />In 5 man dungeons, solo, and pvp, you will own. It will be as good as you expect. In the mainhand I get around 9 procs per minute over long term and I slice and dice fairly frequently. In PVP it's total confusion with lightning and tornadoes hitting all thier d00dz. However, in raids, I don't notice NEARLY (repeat NEARLY) the dps boost I had expected. Perhaps an extra 20 dps on a rough guess. But while I was thinking about how expensive a moderate dps boost in a raid that was, I realized something.<br /><br />TF's main benefit is not damage. TF's benefit is the proc. Not the 300 (I've got a 495 max) damage. It's the -25% attack speed. On a raid boss, that's 25% less physical damage. So, obviously, it does benefit the tank, but also the tanks healers, which leaves more mana for them to heal everyone else. It doesn't matter who has the sword in the raid as far as SOMEONE has it. <br /><br />The argument about causing way too much aggro gain is like most of the arguments about Thunderfury. They're made by people who haven't used one. I've noticed very little increase in nasty aggro situations and certainly nothing uncontrollable. <br /><br />In regards to the Off Hand/Main Hand argument. Anything short of a Grand Marshal's sword, Main hand it. Period. Don't care about your math, Ive tested it long term.<br /><br />So, in conclusion: Guilds should open up to the idea of a rogue having it. I'd say it's benefitted my guild just as much as if the tank had gotten it and Im sure they'd agree.<br /><br />If I could go back and had the choice to bid on that first binding again, would I? No. I would pass on it. The effort put in is not worth the end result, in my opinion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone know what the proc rate has been lowered to since 1.9? The patch notes only stated that it had been lowered, not by how much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I guess there are still some things that are not clear.<br /><br />1. Yes, the sword is a quest reward. A reward for the quest where you need to kill Thunderaan. And to summon Thunderaan you need both bindings of windseeker and 10 elementium bars and some other nice crap. So, there will be no &quot;ninjaing this thing from Thunderaan&quot; nor any n00b rogues with this weapon. No worries there.<br /><br />2. It's definitely a weapon for a tank. It couldn't be any more tanky even if the words &quot;For tanks&quot; were written on it. Also, checking the dps and max damage, no pvp warrior would specifically want this weapon either. The proc is awesome for both pvp and pve, but for pvp there are other very good 1handers that are easier to get.<br /><br />3. Thunderaan is very easy to kill. I was there when my guild did it. We were a full 40-man raid just because everyone wanted to see the boss, but I'm sure it'd go down with like.. 10 people. Very easy with a few good healers and a good tank. I'd say a load easier than most MC bosses. Thunderaan obviously does nature damage, so if you are having problems (which I would find weird), drink a few nature resist potions. All that Thunderaan manages to do is hit the MT and use some weird multitarget lightning bolt that does something like 1k+ damage. I'm guessing it also has some melee hit that sends one flying, since I saw some guildies fly in air.<br /><br />4. I doubt any server will see much rogues or paladins with this weapon. It clearly requires a LOT of work to get, and any guild that gets one will surely give it to their MT. Only if they get a second or third one, I could see a rogue or paladin getting it. I doubt there are any pvp-oriented guilds that even have this weapon. So it's pointless to argue about which class would be best with this weapon, 'cause it'll go to the tank and be used in pve mostly.</div>

If it were upgraded in damage for being /gaps legendary, then maybe it would be worth it, but not now. The only reason a rogue/hunter would want this is for looks =p. The base damage on it is less than gutgore meaning your sinister strikes hit for A S S damage, on top of that it is 1.9 speed, where most sword rogues wont even consider using swords of 2.4 or lower that know what they are doing. If you want to be a sword rogue with any type of brain get a Brutality Blade or a Viskaag the Bloodletter which are much easier to get than this. This weapon should be warrior or paladin only.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Though this sword isn't as amazing as before for tanking, it is still a decent competitor. It's proc, though generating far less agro then before is still useful in raids, thanks to the 20% attack speed decrease. It's hard to call it the best now, with the new weapons in the expansion, but it can still hold its own.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow, slap that on a warlock, watch rogues #$%^&amp; even more because they can't have it. I get downright flamed sometimes for carrying a phantom blade with my warlock. Why do i do it? Look up there, see that word, Flair. Because it looks cool. I could careless about my stats as I'm yet to get into end game raiding. I think it'd be fun to watch all these melee classes piss a fit because a caster was wielding one of these. Har.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Whoever said a rogue wouldn't want this because it would instantly draw a severe beating onto said rogue was correct. (Although single target this weapon is legendary quality for a rogue or anyone else, from what I've heard about the procc rate)<br /><br />Everything else in this thread is either wrong, skewed, upside down or backwards. One cute example is the attack power in relation to weapon speed diagnosis.<br /><br />Since the servers are down and I've got nothing to do, I'll correct you, poor misguided uncle's son.<br /><br />Attack power functions this way, for everyone: 14 attack power translates to 1 dps. So if you're swinging a weapon with 1.0 speed 14 attack power is going to give you 1 extra dmg per swing (assuming your target has 0% armor reduction). Continuing on, if you're swinging a weapon with 4.0 speed and you have 1400 attack power you're getting 100 DPS, and if you're swinging a weapon with 1.0 speed and you have the same attack power, guess how much DPS you're getting? 100 (That's okay you'll get it next time, I'm sure). The only difference is that you'll be getting 400 damage a swing from your attack power with the 4.0 speed weapon and 100 damage a swing with the 1.0.<br /><br />In short: you're wrong, Attack power translates to the same net damage (on auto-swing, for instant attacks slower weapons will receive a bigger boost from attack power) regardless of weapon speed.<br /><br />Someone else (who demonstrated correct understanding of the effect of attack power) said that Ashbringer is bad for Mortal Striking. Quite the hilarious statement considering Ashbringer is a 489 top end Two handed sword with a 4.0 speed off Nefarious. You meant Thunderfury is bad for MSing, and it's clearly intended to be used for heroic striking.<br /><br />Great warrior weapon, decent rogue weapon. Paladins and hunters aren't real people. They're zombies.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Jul 26 15:14:59 2005</div>

Just too bad by the time you got it, you wouldn't be running instances where you can survive five mobs :(</div> Midvalleyzorz<br /><br />This sword is from MC and is the ideal sword for a defensive tank in Black wing layer. There you will find that at times there are many more then 5 mobs in your face at any given time. Also people should note that the proc AOE effect is a debuff and causes no damage in and of itself. Pretty much anyone who attacks one of those mobs will still draw the agro as it takes almost no damage to draw more agro then debuffs. So dont think the proc is going to steal mobs from other tanks. This sword is the ideal sword for black wing layer and I can’t wait to get one of my own. I have one half and im working on the arcane till I get the other half.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Why Warlock?<br /><br />Warlocks can melee, not well, but they can. The only classes they have problems with are all melee-based, and they can swing between casts and cooldown and/or silence. 300 nature damage AOE with -20% attack speed can really turn the tides of a melee-based battle.<br /><br />For everyone else, this is an offhand. Hunter would get the least use out of it, and now 41-point Rogues in the expansion will have that ability that attacks with both weapons at once. This means they can still spam attacks and proc it off.<br /><br />Fury Warriors might love this as an offhand and all, but seeing as they get a lesser use because none of their skills use the offhand, they aren't priority.<br /><br />So really, the first to get this should be 41 Assassination Rogues, followed by Warlocks. My guess is that your guild isn't going to be able to deck out all their Rogues with Thunderfury, so Warlocks probably will never get to see it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can't believe people are still QQ'ing about this sword. Have you never been in a guild where the MT actually had Tfury? I've seen a guild with 7. Every single one of the people who had it was a tank. (With the exception of 1, who was a rogue). There's a reason the weapon proc slows down enemy attack speed, and I'll tell you this, its not so the rogue has to dodge less. End of Story, Tanking weapon. Level 70 Prot warriors still prefer Tfury over any other tanking weapon, no matter what its top end dmg is, because the procc holds a hell of alot more aggro than anyone thinks it does, and ontop of that, it procs on enemies who are CC'd, and doesn't break CC. As in, you sheep 2 targets and seduce 2, the tank's proc will hit the guy he's tanking, and the 4 others next to him, thus gaining aggro on 5 mobs at once, without breaking CC. And like I said, its a damn good amount of aggro for it being a simple weapon proc.<br /><br />Tanking weapon mainly, so shut it rogues, you get plenty of &amp;*!@ thats much better, you just want it because its orange. As for pallies, well, I haven't seen much pally action before TBC, but as of 70, i've seen pallies tank as well as warriors, so in what i've seen, they're a viable player to recieve one, as long as they're protection specc (or whatever its called for pallies)<br /><br />This comes from a priest who's seen just about every instance out there (including naxx).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have heard from quite a few people that this is the best MT weapon period...I currently tank for my guild and find that damage output has absolutely nothing to do with holding aggro...it instead comes from skills like revenge and sunder armor (granted damage dealt does produce hate but not nearly as much as these skills) now im just curious, am I missing something...wouldnt this be better in the hands of a combat rogue then a MT?<br /><br />I mean personally I would rather have bloodlords defender than this...actually has stats that i want and none wasted that I dont need...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a ONLY MT weapon!<br /><br />1. perfect stats for tanking<br />2. high dmg = much aggro with spamming hs and sunder armor<br />3. the proc of this weapon slows ALSO BWL BOSSES to 75% (in 1.9 80%) af there attack speed -&gt; 25% less dmg to the MT.<br />4. the proc does not break CC effects so a sheeped target will not get unsheeped by the proc next to de main target...<br />5. any other class will not be able to use this waepon in pve because, hunters do ranged dmg, rogues would get aggro of many mobs by the proc -&gt; instant death (alos the stats are no good - cause the weapon is to fast), paladins are ment to heal...<br />6. with this waepon in the hand of your mt bwl is much more easy...<br /><br />so please all other classes - shut up!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon is... My dream. It's absolutely beautiful. For anyone who thinks otherwise, here's a few examples.<br /><br />Protection-based warrior: IMO this sword would sit best with a protection Warrior. The aim of a protection warrior are mainly just to hold mobs and provide support to other classes, right? Right. Not only does this sword massly decrease the nature defense of enemies, making your Druid and Shaman teammates do more damage, not only does it lower an enemies attack speed making you take less damage, but it also hits, in effect, 6 enemies. This is basically an area-effect taunt. It would not only do great damage to 5 enemies near you and lure them, but it would also do mass damage to the enemy you target, basically buff druids and shammies, and is 1-handed. It's also quick, meaning you could keep steady threat being generated and increase the effect of the talent and defense-stance given threat bonuses. It's absolutely best suited to a defense warrior, I believe.<br /><br />Rogue: Rogue have poisons, poisons are nature damage. Buff yourself.<br /><br />Hunters: Hunters also have nature damage. Same as above.<br /><br />Paladins: Paladins have a lot of useful things that effect lots of enemies, such as auras. Once again, like Protection Warriors, it would make a lot of enemies want to attack you, making you the main focus of the area, and also lure a lot of them to attacking your nice little Aura of Retribution.<br /><br />Overall, I think this sword is best for Protection types, but it's really good for any class that can get it. You'd have to be careful however, as it could also work against you if you're in a large place where there's lots of enemies, and you have a number of tanks who each take a couple of enemies, since you could unwittingly attract more enemies than intended. Likewise for Hunter and Rogue, you could pull enemies that haven't been aggro'd by anyone yet. Due to this, you'd have to take serious caution with this weapon, and maybe even put it away during certain battles where you can't afford to attract too many enemies.<br /><br />But all in all GOD I want one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd just like to comment to my fellow rogues who seem to think this will be a better sword for you than a warrior, especially a main tank warrior: it's not. Unless you are absolutely awesome at not pulling aggro, you better let your main tank or secondary/backup tanks grab these before you let your guild even consider you. The proc seems to, according to our main tank, occur quite alot. I'm not saying Rogues don't desrve this, b/c as a Rogue, if I were sword specced, I would LOVE it. But as far as getting it over a tank? You have to be out of your mind. :(</div>

If you think a hunter would actually get this you are really confused.<br /><br />A Warrior or PvE Rogue will get this over you, it's pure PvE yes you can use it for pvp, but you will see why it's for PvE if your a decent guild in BWL.<br /><br />Hunters are range keep it that way, the mats are hard to obtain, 100 Arcanite Bars, 30 Elementium Flux and 10 Elementium Ore, which drop off BWL Technician mobs, get about 2 per full BWL run. <br /><br />Essence of fire lord drops off of, Ragnaros when you have both bindings and are on the quest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me 2 years of playing WoW to finally finish making this sword. Innumerable repair bills, Geddon kills, and wipes, not to mention all the farming I did for the bars. Sword cost me well over 5 thousand gold, which took several months of farming in between raids (no pvp /wrist), but it was well worth it. I replaced my Edge of Chaos (I lost multiple Castigator/Servo/Sundered Bone bids in the mean time) with it, and my DPS jumped as much as 50. Whirlwind with it is a &amp;*!@ing joke, but that is to be expected; I raid in Battle Stance these days, as 3% crit isn't worth giving up Overpower. Enclosed in my signature are links to my raiding and pvp gear sets, and you can find a video of me PvPing with TF on Google Videos (lost that link a lon g time ago, sorry =/) and THERE I stay in Zerker stance, simply because in PVP I need the crit more than in endgame. I was 10% away from a Claw Of The Frost Wyrm at the time of Xpac, when I get some decent lvl 70 gear I'll update my sig, though most of my gear has yet to be replaced . Good luck to all of you who 10-man MC in Xpac, for this thing, it's awesome =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>According to the information wray provided in teh guide:<br /><br />isnt the actual dps of this sword is about 100?<br />not bad for a one hander.<br /><br />reasoning:<br />average hit = 79.5damage.<br />average nature added = 23 damage.<br />proc is 30%. so every 3 hits is +300 damage. <br />every SINGLE hit is +100 damage (on average)<br />SO average hit:<br />79.5 + 23 + 100 = 202.5<br />dps = average damage/attack speed<br /> = 202.5/1.9<br /> = 106.6 dps<br /><br />Not including nature resist, or the fact that if the proc is 30% the target is almost consantly 25% lower attack speed, or attack power. <br /><br />I'm pretty sure this logic holds! I'm not 100% though :)</div>

Not to mention you cripple 5 nearby opponents melee (reducing damage you take, and make targets more vulnerable to nature damages (poison).<br /><br />Interestingly the 16-30 nature damage on the weapon damage will go through physical invulnerabilities and can still cause a direct damage proc on the opponent. So it can proc through BoP, Inv Mail, and Inv Potions.<br /><br />~Shisho - The first Paladin to roll on a Legendary Warrior/Rogue weapon... and win.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I thought I would do u guys the favor of doing the Actual DPS of this freakin weapon. Which I am currently making :). This thing will still out DPS TBC swords without a Rumored &quot;Legendary quest upgrade&quot;.<br /><br />Ok the actual White damage on this thing is 41.84<br /><br />((44+115)/2)/1.9 = 41.84DPS<br /><br />Ok now I watched the low and top end damage on just the little nature damage that is &quot;standard&quot; to the weapon. It was hitting as low as 16 and as much as 94 thru the debuff.<br /><br />((16+94)/2)/1.9 = 28.94DPS<br /><br />OK now we getting some where! 41.84+ 28.94 = 70.78DPS! THAT IS THE ACTUAL DPS of the weapon with the WHITE damage + the &quot;Standard&quot; nature damage factoring the averaage damage with and without the Debuff :)<br /><br />THUNDERFURY HAS an Actual &lt;&lt;&lt; 70.78DPS &gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />We aint done yet! Now we gotta add the proc damage. I watched the video again ( I used 135k warrior video, its on the Neff fight :) ) It had as low as 300 damage and as max top end with the debuff (lowers Nature resists by 25) of 450.<br /><br />((300+450)/2)/1.9 = 197.36DPS<br /><br />Ok now we gotta factor the Proc rate. Well I have heard as high as 33%, that seems high, so im going to do 33% and 10% so we got an extreme and a minimium.<br /><br />197.36/3 = 65.78DPS (33%)Proc rate<br />197.36/10 = 19.73DPS (10%)Proc rate<br /><br />Ok hold on to your hats.<br /><br />70.78 + 65.78 = 136.56DPS (33%) Proc Rate<br />70.78 + 19.73 = 90.51DPS (10%) Proc Rate<br /><br />OMGZ the LOWEST DPS is &lt;&lt;&lt; 90.51DPS &gt;&gt;&gt; ! That beats TBC swords :P. GG TBC:P<br />Now that it is confirmed that its a 20% proc rate the DPS of the weapon is 110DPS.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 25th 2007 1:59pm by Ruelin</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GluthFroge</b></h3>War Tank or Rogue,<br /><br />Hello,<br /><br />The big question is to whom to attribute this weapon. <br />It should be known that only 2 classes can have it the rogue and the War Tank. Why not the war dps? because the war dps already has a big generation of agro and can't reset its agro.<br /><br />To have had TF at the time of classic, it is clear that the first Tf must go back to a tank. The allocation of the second if you have the chance. <br />Can be done on a rogue that will be a huge value on the raid. (It remains the best rogue/hunt/war weapon)<br /><br />TF Up dps Boss raid (full t3 bis):<br />Rogue: +200 DPS<br />war tank: +40 DPS<br />Hunt: +500 DPS (Boss only meele)<br />war dps: +120 DPS<br /><br />TF Up dps Aoe raid (Full t3 bis):<br />Rogue: +1500 dps<br />War Tank: +500 dps<br />Hunt: +600 dps (Meele + distance)<br />War dps: +700 dps<br /><br />But the most important rule is: Give to someone you trust because it's a lot of time for have it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GmWazzUp</b></h3>Can a Warlock wear this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nextlevelplays</b></h3>This is by an enormous margin the best tanking weapon for the duration of classic. The proc puts out an absolutely stupid amount of threat. Nothing, even in Naxx, comes close.<br /><br />For some context, a few days ago I was running MC on my mage who is basically full pre-BWL BiS, and I crit a trash mob being tanked by a Thunderfury tank 4 times in a row on my first 4 hits. I immediately checked my threat to make sure I wasn't going to pull aggro, and the tank had almost 3 times my threat. At least for a while, it is essentially impossible to pull aggro from a TF tank without any kind of threat drop mechanic.<br /><br />Relatedly, if you give a Thunderfury to a DPS before 1 or 2 of your tanks has it, you may as well assign a healer to res him full-time, because he is going to pull aggro <br /> on every single fight. If you thought 100 arcanite bars was expensive, just wait to see those repair bills ;)</div>

They do however still inflict extra damage in the amount specified in the tooltips. This is not noted in the combat log separately and is simply calculated as additional physical damage added to the weapon’s attack.<br /><br />That being said, it has been noticed by players that when using an elemental barrier such as a nature/frost/fire protection potion or a shield that absorbs a specific element, you will see an “absorbed (X)” message in the combat log. This is also correct and working as expected, and such effects will reduce the damage of attacks by such weapons by the amount of extra elemental damage specified in the weapon tooltip.<br /><br />Ultimately the way these weapons function is a very old quirk/bug with how original World of Warcraft was built. While definitely strange and unintuitive, these weapons are behaving exactly as they did in the original game and we have no intention of changing them to behave differently in WoW Classic.<br /><br />I hope this helps provide some clarity around this very odd quirk inherent to these types of weapons!&quot;</i><br />Blizzard post: <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/weapons-with-frost-damage-or-any-other-school-dont-work/569190/6" rel="nofollow">https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/weapons-with-frost-damage-or-any-other-school-dont-work/569190/6</a><br />Wowhead post: <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/news=316707/blizzard-clarifies-that-extra-elemental-damage-from-weapons-is-working-as-intend">https://classic.wowhead.com/news=316707/blizzard-clarifies-that-extra-elemental-damage-from-weapons-is-working-as-intend</a></div>

    "[item=19019] is the [color=q5]legendary[\/color] sword once wielded by [url=?npc=14435]Thunderaan[\/url], Prince of Air. The prince, son of Al'Akir the Windlord, was attacked by Ragnaros the Firelord, in an attempt to heighten the already impressive power that the fire elemental held.

What remained of Thunderaan was placed in a talisman of elemental binding, which was broken into two pieces.
