<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is one reliable EASY stranglekelp drop near the Zoram Strand.&nbsp; Swim out along the cliffs at the south end of the beach until you find it.&nbsp; I have made flights there for that purpose and it has always been there.&nbsp; of course, there are other drops in the area, but most are well guarded.&nbsp; Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stranglekelp is used in a bunch of alchemy recipies, especially any from 120 skill to about 180.&nbsp; One of the recipies is a water breathing potion (it also requires some blackmouth oil you get from, not surprisngly, the oily blackmouth).&nbsp; My utility gatherer is a lv22 Warrior with Skinning/Herbalism and FIshing, cooking and first aid.&nbsp; He gathers the kelp, fishes for blackmouth, then mails stacks back to the mage, who, in turn, sends back a stack of 5 water breathing potions, which give a lot of herb gathering time.<br /><br />If you're looking for spots, hit the Wetlands.&nbsp; Hands down it's the best place for mid-range characters (20-40) to gather kelp.&nbsp; But beware-- Blizzard has lvl 22-24 or better camping the areas where the kelp pops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Things I've done to farm stranglekelp effectively are:<br /><br /><ul><li>Use a druid, get druid to level 18 and get seal form.&nbsp; Swimming up and down the coast is much easier when you're fast and don't need air.<br /></li><li>Download the addon &quot;Gatherer&quot;.&nbsp; This will help you by keeping track of where stranglekelp appears.&nbsp; Herbs have pre-designated spawn locations, however they aren't always spawned.&nbsp; This addon will allow you to map out specific points so you can avoid areas that never seem to have it.<br /></li><li>Places I've found for stranglekelp that are fairly safe for level 18 are Westfall and Darkshore.&nbsp; I personally prefer Westfall because the coast is easier to navigate.<br /></li></ul><br /><br />I've been consistently selling stranglekelp for 3g/stack and haven't had much success at higher prices.<br /><br />I also send my kelp to another account which is stationed near the AH.&nbsp; There is an hour delay in sending items through mail, but it helps me avoid flying to IF every time I need to sell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On Earthen Ring, the single biggest users of Strangle are alchemists making Elixir of Defense for cloth and leather armor guys. Don't know a druid or rogue who would get into a fight without one of these; can't speak for cloth armor guys. Defense potions of all strengths are probably the biggest sellers at the ER AH, and while the prices might not be as high as some other servers, you will sell everything you can make within the 8-hour slot.<br /><br />Thanks for some of the hunting tips; my alchemist was having a tough time finding enough. She's a druid and aquatic form is simply killer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Zoram Strand is by far the best place to gather kelp.&nbsp; In about an hour and a half i had 43 stranglekelp total. <br /><br />I've been getting about <b>10-12g</b> (way too much IMO, but i dont complain) per stack of 20.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Several people here have said Wetlands is the best place to find this.&nbsp; I must agree, and there are enough unguarded spots that even at low levels it's not too hard to get.<br /><br />For those who are not:<br />A) undead;<br />B) warlocks with the breathing buff;<br />C) druids with aquatic form; or<br />D) using a breathing potion;<br /><br />There is a simple method to getting this seaweed without too much danger to oneself.&nbsp; Someone used the term &quot;water walking&quot;, and I think this might be what was meant.<br /><br />Basically, one swims across the surface of semideep water, with the Find Herbs function turned on.&nbsp; When stranglekelp is located, swim until you are practically &quot;on top&quot; of the stranglekelp on the minimap, then swim <i>straight</i> down.&nbsp; Once you spot the kelp visually, change your course to get close to it (if it's unguarded).&nbsp; Harvest it, then swim <i>straight</i> up.&nbsp; You should be back with plenty of breath bar to spare.<br /><br />It's best to use this method at Wetlands, some distance from shore.&nbsp; Generally stranglekelp far offshore is unguarded.<br /><br />Edit: Note to self, it's STRANGLEkelp, not STRANGEkelp.</div>
