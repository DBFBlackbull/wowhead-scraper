You have to bring back some parts to a master engineer in the alterac valley. If you bring him 'nuff parts he will give you this shredder.<br /><br />looks like the normal goblin shredder mech's.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I picked up this quest after joining the battleground at a point in which the horde controlled 75% of the map and Zinfizzlex was in Frostwolf. i gathered the materials and went&nbsp; back in the next day, but he wasn't in Frostwolf anymore. the quest mentions &quot;(After my capture).&quot; Will he not be in frostwolf till the horde catches him? And if so, Where can i find him at the onset of a battle to capture him?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This thing is great, only bad thing is, you only get it for 3 days.&nbsp; got mine with a group of 8 lvl 60s. when escorty the goblin out of the cave he starts to run and aggros everything he runs buy so be ready to fight a hard fight! The quest is repeatable but not sure if it's worth having to farm all that ore more than once. But i must say if you have a group that has about 10 or 12 of these you can really do some dammage to the opposing side.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so in return for over 10g in materials i will get a item i can only use for 3 days wow what a bargain</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>u dont really have to BUY the mats u could FIND them it ould be a lot of work killin and lootin but on top of that u get money and maybe some sick items</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got mine about 5 days ago. It hasn't left my inventory, but it also doesn't work right. Now, when I summon it, I can't control it. It just sits there and won't attack until something comes near it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The quest giver is located in the winteraxe troll cave.&nbsp; The mobs are 57-60 elites but you can send in a rogue to get the quest.&nbsp; S/he just has to sap one mob, talk to the goblin and release him.&nbsp; The goblin does not aggro the mobs and you do not have to actually escort him out.<br /><br />The mats do cost about 10-15g to make, so if you are really poor this probably isn't worth it (poor faction increase, etc).&nbsp; I can mine (rogue) so I mine the rich thorium in the cave to offset the costs of making shredders.&nbsp; <br /><br />Shredders are *great* in the hands of rogues though, as it allows on rogue to ninja a graveyard himself as long as there isn't an elite guard.&nbsp; It also provides a nice tank for taking out elites and korrak.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Shredder can be used for a period of 3 days, and has a 45 min cooldown, it is controlled through the shredders eyes. Lvl 60 Elite. lasts untill it dies, can be re summoned after 45 mins</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Guys - it is a '3 day' gametime cooldown - not 3 days RL - so you actually get quite alot of use out of this baby (true as of 1.7).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has s/o found out were he moved too, now that the Winteraxe cavern was &quot;wiped out by an avalanche&quot;?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can't hand in the quest to Zinfizzlex, although he stands right in front of me here in Frostwolf Keep, with a yellow question mark over his head.<br />I've got all materials, of course. Very wierd.<br /><br />EDIT: I read 30/30 Mithril Bars, but it's 30/50 I've got. The 20 others are on the bank, therefore it says the quest is completed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He can be found in Dun Baldur for alliance in the bunker next to the guy you go to to release the reavers! You must have all of the required materials with you...the only thing I can't find out is where the heck the lumber mill is for the Horde!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>FYI: The goblin guy is located behind the Snowfall Graveyard.&nbsp; He's surrounded by a ton of Winterax trolls in the beginning.&nbsp; He doesn't aggro Korrak, but if you encounter enemy wolf riders or other enemy npcs, he'll stop and fight. Basically, if you have Snowfall Graveyard, you should be able to do it solo as a rogue, in a pair with other classes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It sucks bad that it is just useable three days. Farming the materials takes too much time and is too boring to do this every three days...<br /><br />Information:<br />You can find Zinfizzlex lying between two winteraxe trolls at snowfall. Just talk to him and he will run to your base without gaining aggro from any neutral units.<br />Did this alone today with a level 60 hunter on terrodar (eu/ger)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is this one of those AV quests hat gives a huge amount of faction on your first turn in?&nbsp; I noticed that most of the repeatable AV quests are like that</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know the exact amount of faction for turning in this quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know why the shredder just suddenly stops working? I start controlling it for about 5-10 min, then it just doesnt work anymore and i have to wait the remaining time to summon him again... Can anyone give me an answer?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I saw this shredder a few months back on my main before i switched realms.. And just looked it up now to see how to get it.<br /><br />Only question i have is; is this quest repeatable?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>GUYS!<br /><br />How much time do i have to say it!<br /><br />This ROCK!<br /><br />it's not our 3 days but 3 days game time.<br /><br />And if a ppl play just 1 a day (tooooo bad for him)<br />he will have and play with it like 4 months so it wont go off you if you play and bit. <br />but if you play like 20h the day ofc it will go</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He use to be in the cave at winteraxe hold..now that the cave is gone where did they move him to. And where does he spawn now in the horde town once you do the escort?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He is laying on the ground near Snowfall Graveyard.&nbsp; Once you right click him you get a little speech about going back to your base and building the shredder.<br /><br />Then he begins walking back to your base, does not need escorted, and the quest is then doable.&nbsp; Just make a mad dash for SF at the start of AV and talk to him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Been a while since i played AV, realy since AB released a few months back. Alot has changed since then. Flipped through all teh patch notes adn caught back up on whats changed now except one thing.<br /><br />Can shredders still be healed by part members OTHER than bandages. If i remember correctly they could be cast healed before....everybody was telling me they couldnt heal him...is this true or are ppl just getting lazy on me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got this on Stormreaver, and the first time i used it, a Shaman was able to heal me..... But not all the time! :S - Druids are not able to heal it, dont know about priests... Anyone know?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As mentioned above, the 3 Day limit on the shredder is not a real time limit, it's a game time limit.&nbsp; For those confused about the distinction, please allow me to explain.<br /><br />Let's say you are relatively hardcore and even if you have work or school or whatnot you play WoW for 6 hours a day.&nbsp; Let's say this is average for a serious PvPer.&nbsp; The internal counter is not even quite accurate at that, it either rounds down or doesn't include loading times, etc, so you'll probably get away at any rate with 5 and 1/2 hours counting off your clock.<br /><br />So, in that whole &quot;day&quot; of playing 5 and 1/2 hours will be taken off your Shredder's 3 days.&nbsp; At that rate, you will have your shredder for almost 2 weeks, and 2 weeks of serious AV play is enough for almost any one to reach exalted!&nbsp; This is a great item, and in long BGs you can proc it 3 or 4 times for some serious damage.<br /><br />Again, most committed PvPers will have their shredder for 2 weeks.&nbsp; More than enough time to get your purple items ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is so annoying, just got done breaking my channeling without ever hitting anything... i hit &quot;1&quot; to auto attack but it thought i wanted to use my char to auto attack and it stopped channeling GG...<br /><br />careful and dont mistakenly hit any of your characters abilities while channeling</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is the shredder guy still available after the latest patch? Ive been in Av 5-6 times and he hasnt been there and we've got to sf gy first each time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah a gm said he was in there but couldnt tell me where, i ve been carrying all the bars of ore etc around since the last patch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There's an Engineer-Only Mechanical Repair Kit. It should Heal the Shredder.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've done tons of AVs on my 60 warrior on azgalor (Doisha) and i cant find him i have most of the items I need just cant find him if anyone knows where he is can you post a reply or send me a tell (im an alliance)</div>
