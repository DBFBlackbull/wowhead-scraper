He said the casters in your raid should be using this if possible. He said he'd eat the ones that refuse to use them.<br /><br />If I were you, I'd listen to him. Flasks make things much easier in raids. Just a few of them being active in your raid makes a difference.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There's an alchemy lab in Ras Frostwhisper's room in Scholomance, and in Firemaw's room in Blackwing Lair. The BWL one is nice because you can just walk right up to it at any time if you've cleaned out the room (thanks to the instance being saved for a week).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To post above: is there a problem with using BOTH?<br /><br />so + base mana and then x amount that ur mana pot will give you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you want to make money sell this potion to the mage class leader of the &quot;best&quot; guild on your server. The guild that has refused to open gates to ahn qiraj unless you pay them 5000g or something. At least on my server the mage class leader doesen�t�know what to spend his money on. He got fulll tier2 set and night elf epic mount. <br /><br />I think I can easily sell this pot for 50g. SO if I sell 10 flasks of supreme power I can buy epic mount =). Just go to Winterspring and get mats and if your guild does BWL you can go there and make these flasks, otherwhise you have to get a group for scholo =/.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When it says increases damage by up to X amount, it is not a random addition.&nbsp; The damage increase is relative to the casting time for direct damage spells.&nbsp; DOTs get the full bonus regardless of casting time.&nbsp; Spells with unmodified casting times of 3 seconds or greater also get the full bonus.&nbsp; Spells with casting times under 3 sec get part of the bunus with the lower limit being (I think) 50% for instant casts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In response to &quot;tankedmage&quot; a while back... &quot;i don't find this flask very useful&quot; and prefers the flask of distilled widsom.. haha? honestly... if your fireball hits for 128 more dont you think that if every fireball did that over 2 hours it would be a ^&amp;*! load of difference?<br /><br />If you were firing fireballs constantly for 2 hours say... you would prolly get around ~2000 off.<br /><br />2000 * 128... thats an extra 256000 dmg from the flask alone... yep this flask sucks........... i'd much rather have the flask of distilled wisdom that would give me 0 extra dmg.. haha!<br /><br />As for the AOE.. if you are hitting 20 targets at once and it does 25 extra dmg thats an extra 500 dmg per tick!<br /><br />DMG gear is the most valuable thing for a damage dealer in this game.. get as much as you can because it's the only thing that increases your dmg, not ^&amp;*!ty intel.<br /><br />Flask of supreme power = awesome.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No one is intereseted in reading that you won it last&nbsp; night in the instance and you rolled a need roll.... Dont you have anything to say that will actually matter? That might actually help ppl like where it drops and useful information.. I just cant see how its good to know that it dropped in your run in that instance on that server and you won it cause you were the only alchemist and sold it for that price too that guy... So plz; stop adding comments writing what i think most ppl just dont care about or forget in 3 sec... Thank you =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes the flask stackes with any other effect as far as know, ( exept the other flasks)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>to the person who said this flask is useless i can only say: get acquainted with end-game and stop talking bullsh1t to other people. flasks useless? esp. this one? i bet all your equipment doesn't add +150 to spell dmg because u are such a noob, but let me tell u, endgame mages and warlocks can get maximum +6-700 dmg from ALL their gear and a good gear too, only bwl+ gear can push it so far. and u sir are telling me that +150 is nothing? one flask gives 25% the dmg bonus from gear that is grinded for many months, useless? either u haven't even smelled endgame content or u are seriously retarded and should stop playing this game forever.<br />zacry u mate are not right either, this flask is PRICELESS for pve. aggro management is something completely different, no matter if u have +200 or +700 dmg u should know when to slow down or stop dps. that comes with experience. one other advantage of this flask is that u can use lower rank spells which cost considerably less mana. lower ranks for same dmg = more dmg / mana = a lot of mana conservation = a lot more than +2000 max mana from the other flask if u ask me. for pvp ofc this flask is 1000 times more useful. no aggro management, no lower ranks. just nuke the bastards:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Funny that nobody mentions it is also be used for recipes. This is an ingredient for a Sageblade (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=53286">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=53286</a>) and for Black Grasp of the Destroyer (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=53268">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=53268</a>) both epics. So people can also want this potion for not consuming it but using for an epic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got this today in scholo.&nbsp; Almost noone runs scholo anymore, and I thought I would have to get keepers of time exalted for the recipe.&nbsp; Good thing pallies still need dark runes for their mount.<br /><br />If blizz nerfs this with the 2.1 patch in the upcoming alchemy &quot;review&quot;, I will cry.&nbsp; Full raid flasks for some of these bosses is stupid.&nbsp; I agree, the mat farming must be hell.&nbsp; But ruining the only reason a mage would bother keeping herb/alch is stupider.&nbsp; Make em useable by only alchemists, if they're too overpowered.&nbsp; Tailors still benefit from chugging this flask, while alchemists can't touch spellfire/frozen shadowweave.</div>
