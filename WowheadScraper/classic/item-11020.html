He wants 20 Un'goro soils, which you give the to NPC behind the Arch Druids' tree. Talk to the Arch Druid again and he sends you to the NPC below him. That is where you get the Evergreen Pouch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This bag needs 2 Ungoro soil samples.<br />Every 10 minutes it will produce a shell out of which you get a random herb.<br /><br />If you are an Alchemist and quest in UnGoro from time to time (eg: Getting the crystals), this is handy thing to have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>is there any value at all to this thing? does it help in anyway?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been using this pouch for a while now, and all it's spitting out are random herbs - no morrowgrain.&nbsp; granted the herbs are nice, since i'm an alchemist, but as a lvl 300 herbalist you'd think i could get it right and produce morrowgrain...&nbsp; anywho - is there some trick to getting morrowgrain to pop out?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it is random... sometimes the bag produces the certain herb</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I buy a stack of seeds, and when i can i get the soil.&nbsp; sometimes it's in the AH for real cheap, othertimes people in UGC will fork some over if they have any and I ask.&nbsp; I make the casing, open it, and when I build up a stack of alchemy herbs i send it to my druid who when i start playing him I will make an alchemist.&nbsp; When i get Morrowgrain which isnt the most often i go and turn it in for the Cenarion Circle care package and the reputation.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Maybe just my imagnation, but the random herbs seem to be correlated to the map you're in when using the pouch -&nbsp; I get a lot of herbs that actually grow in these locations.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I cultivated the seeds while in Ironforge. the first two times I did it, I got 4 morrowgrain and 2 morrowgrain respectively. I went to Ungoro to get more soil and the first time I cultivated in Ungoro, I got sungrass. If you're having problems getting morrowgrain, try doing it in Ironforge. I can't guarantee but seems to work for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For horde:<br /><br />Use an Evergreen Pouch with a Packet of Tharlendis Seeds and two Un'Goro Soil samples to try and cultivate samples of Morrowgrain.<br /><br />Here's your Evergreen Pouch that you'll need to use the Tharlendis seeds with. You also need to have Un'Goro soil samples on hand to use as fertilizer for the seeds. Just use the pouch when you have everything; the pouch will take care of the rest.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3786/morrowgrain-research">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3786/morrowgrain-research</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's the best way to make gold while you're not actually playing... just set yourself up somewhere safe, use it, set an alarm to go off in ten minutes, go do something else IRL, when the alarm goes off Alt-Tab back into WoW, make another set of herbs, rinse repeat.<br /><br />Once you're ready to go back to actually playing hit the AH &amp; sell them all.<br /><br />FAT CASH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have no data to back this up, but it seems if you are an Artisan herbalist you get more herbs per herb casing</div>
