Coupled with the Parachute Cloak (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10518">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10518</a>), this item allows you to turn your target into a leper gnome, dismounting them from their gryphon or wyvern, and causing them to plunge to their demise.<br /><br />Get five kills and call yourself an &quot;Ace&quot;!<br /><br />Note: Be careful about using this on Mages or Priests. If they're quick enough with Feather Fall or Levitate, they'll be waiting on the ground for you, and most likely in a bad mood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>16843</b></h3>Last I heard, the dismounting bug was fixed, and it no longer dismounts enemies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9806</b></h3>Confirmed! You can no longer use your Discombobulator Ray to dismount foes on their flying mounts. A kick in the pants for a profession that's already down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>24221</b></h3>Wrong. This still dismounts people from their flying mount. Was flying around Halaa and a 70 rogue used this on me. Leper gnomes make a sickening crunch as they hit the ground from that high up...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can this device be used by any player or you need to be an engineer to use it?<br />Quite a few of the items engineers make can be used only by engineers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just get the delta acces card. go to gnomeregan and find the D-robotic thingy talk to it and u got it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Unfortunatley you do need Delta access card to get it, and about 2 weeks before i found out i needed i saw a few on the AH. of course no one had been selling them in a longtime so i knew i was screwed til i leveled up. i spent some time making somethings and then checked AH again and Bam! card for 25s. i bought it, grabbed a rogue buddy and we snuck into gnomer. got the schems and i just sold a blue item so i had 12g sitting around. i made 7 of these and just walked around IF lloking for ranked players. just a simple /w hey wanna buy a for pvp? and i sold 5 for 2-3g each saved one and put another on AH with the card back for 1G. i took this, net-o-matic, and shrinkray to scarlet monastary. every other person was netted, shrinked or gnomified, my group thought it was funny. Being a druid and having a priest i was able to hibernate the dogs and she mindcontrolled the others so crowd control was no problem. and the boss? eh gnomes arent that scary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is using this truely morally correct? Turning a person into a Leper Gnome! It's even worse than a Gnome! We need to look at the love... <br />Eh, I'm over it! YOU WILL ALL BE GNOMES! HAHAH! AND I, YOUR KING!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What's the cool down on them?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is the coolest thing since sliced bread. An out-of-nowhere, instacast gimpify magic beam. I use it all the time in pvp; favourite usage area is on people trying to escape mounted. The mount vanishes in a poof of air and leaves only a slow, weak and confused gnome.<br /><br />Smen</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First, it works on humanoids, but elites resist it.<br /><br />Second, it works on players extremely well. I don't leave home without it. I haven't seen anyone else use it in either faction that I can recall, and that's just crazy. It is so easy to get and make.<br /><br />Third, this is a killer in PvP. When I first found out about it, I couldn't believe what it does. Plus the shock value on players who have no clue what just happened to them!<br /><br />Fourth, it shares the timer with grenades, so use it as an opening move and if the fight goes long, the grenade timer will end and you can use it as a finishing move. Using a grenade first will make this unusable most of the fight and devaluate it a lot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>it dismounts players.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SacredGalliard</b></h3>As of april 2020, Discombobulator Ray is dismounting people.<br />-Also slows them.<br />-Can be used by everyone, even non-engineers.<br />-Shares cooldowns with grenades.<br />-Has a decent casting range.<br />-Instant.<br />-Turns horde into a leper gnome.<br /><br />Getting the schematics is easy, you can either buy or find <a href="/classic/item=9327/security-delta-data-access-card">Security DELTA Data Access Card</a>, head to delta security terminals before final boss of Gnomeregan, and use them to learn the schematic. Apparently these also drop from Thermaplugg, but can't confirm that. It's easier to learn by terminal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ReelJV</b></h3>This item is the unsung hero of World PVP in Classic so far. For classes like a priest that don't have easy slows like crippling poison or hamstring, this is the single best item in the game I've found for World PVP because it dismounts the enemy. You can learn it for &quot;free&quot; as long as your have the Security Delta card. I just run in the back door of gnomergan and instead of going left for the crown-pummler, go straight down the elevator and learn it from a terminal. You obviously have to be an engineer to learn it. I made the mistake of going there on a non-engineer because I thought it would give me the schematic which is not true. Go there on an engineer and you automatically get it in your engineering menu.<br /><br />YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN ENGINEER TO USE IT!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>llNightWingll</b></h3>confirming in april, 2021, this DOES dismount in Classic P6. not sure what other people are saying, but you can still dismount ppl in bgs and turn them into a Leper lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sonotleet</b></h3>If you're a gnome with 165 engineering in phase 1 of SOD, this is not obtainable. You must complete the Security DELTA Data Access Card quest in Gnomeregan, and Gnomeregan has been converted into a level 40 raid, and you cannot enter the instance at level 25, even if you convert to a raid.</div>
