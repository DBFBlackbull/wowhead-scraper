Requires yet another rare drop to begin a quest chain to create the game's first legendary sword, Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.<br /><br />Along with this, you will need: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18563">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18563</a><br /><br />And the end result: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19019">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19019</a><br /><br />Both bindings are quite rare. Many guilds who have been running Molten Core for over a year now have seen maybe only 1 half. Other guilds may have multiple of one or the other (or both) at this point. It's entirely based on the luck of the drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sweagle</b></h3>You need both the Right- and the Left Half of those bindings to begin creating the legendary Thunderfury weapon. However, a friend of mine got the Left part from Baron Geddon a year ago, he raids Molten Core every week for the Right Half, but he still did not get it. Don't forget, the droprate is very low. But! I should not forget that trying to get it, even after years: it is really worth it, even if it takes so many time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8356</b></h3>For my guild the Garr half was the rarest as well. In two years of raiding MC, my guild has only seen 3 bindings drop from Geddon and 1 drop from Garr. Other guilds on the server have seen several drop within their first few months of raiding. The drop rate on these are completely goofy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3>My guild killed Baron Geddon around 200 times, and we never got a single part of the bracers, we have no rogue/warrior with TF and we are done in AQ40 soon pretty annoyin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its not red, infacts its orange ingame. Its used for a quest that gives a sword called Thunderfury, Blessed blade of the Windseeker</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item is a joined &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; half, both dropped from bosses in Molten Core.&nbsp; This leads to a quest that requires ungodly expensive materials (10 elementium bars, each uses 10 arcanite bar) and another drop from Ragnaros.&nbsp; Then you turn in your quest items and have to go kill someone else for the reward -- legendary sword called &quot;Thunderfury&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest begins when you loot either the Right or Left half of the Bindings of the Windseeker, which drop of Baron Geddon and Garr in Molten Core. Upon looting one of these, you must travel to Silithus and talk with the Highlord Demetrian, who will then give you the Vessel of Rebirth, which will start the quest. <br /><br />What is required to complete this quest? <br /><br />Right Half of Bindings of the Windseeker <br />Left Half of Bindings of the Windseeker <br />Essence of the Firelord- Quest drop from Ragnaros <br />10x Elementium Bar <br /><br />Highlord Demetrian will guide you to an NPC in Winterspring, who will tell you of a Goblin named Krixix who was swallowed up by a rift in the earth while meddling with the mysteries of Elementium. It is he who holds the secrets! <br /><br />Krixix is located in Blackwing Lair, of course. Elementium ore drops random off the goblins in BWL as well. So, what�s needed to make a bar of elementium? <br /><br />1x Elementium Ore <br />3x Elemental Flux <br />1x Firey Core <br />10x Arcanite Bar <br /><br />Multiply that by 10 for the total amount of bars needed and you�re looking at a huge expense. <br /><br />After gathering all the items needed, return to the Highlord Demetrian in Silithus and summon Thunderaan. Rather than gain his blessing, he�s evidently rather angry after his imprisonment, and you must defeat him. After defeating him, you loot the Dormant Wind Kissed Blade and have the now Groveling Demetrian give you Thunderfury, Blessed Sword of the Windseeker. <br /><br />Easy enough? Right? <br /><br />Copied by Kitifanna - The first &quot;girl&quot; with the sword.(still trying)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>During our guild's 120th raid, the bindings dropped off of Garr. Then after killing Baron Geddon, nothing. Later that evening I went to Silithus and spoke to Highlord Demetrian who gave me a quest (involved a mini-quest where i received a vessel of rebirth). Anyways, I ended up missing the next two weeks worth of raids in molten core. So during my guild's 3rd raid (since the first bindings dropped, which was for me the very next raid post-receiving the first bindings), the other half dropped. I think having the quest active in your quest log might help. I also had spend countless hours accruing like 70 arcanite bars/arcane crystals. Now just some arcanite bars, elemental flux and elementium ore and a smelter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If u got one half&nbsp; u are really faar&nbsp; faaaaar away from completing what u need<br /><br />I got one half like 1 year and today second half dropped&nbsp; i got it<br /><br />but I know a really good PvE guilds that didnt get a single drop yet even though they did whole AQ40&nbsp; <br /><br />reconsider one half = nothing, promise of the kiss</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got the left half from Baron Geddon on Alleria a couple days ago. First one for our guild. I was saving points for the Breastplate of Might, but I decided to go ahead and blow 'em on this ^_~ (However, the BP of Might did drop in that same run... second time I missed it. Oh well) Our guild (Silent Reign) is so great, they even decided unanimously that there shouldn't be any fighting over the right binding, and that it should just go to me since I already have the left one. I'm honored to be working towards our guild's first legendary weapon!<br /><br />P.S. I've noticed that people have been getting the left half from Geddon, while the right side seems to be from Garr. So I'm guessing that they can't drop either side, but in fact each only has the one half.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We got this bit yesterday, our MT bid and won it; we didn't have any rule for legendary items, so we basically instated one that when the right bindings drop, they go directly to whoever owns the other half.<br /><br />We didn't get the bindings from Geddon, that would've been very surprising tho :)<br /><br />Edit: I play a rogue, and while I guess I could wield that sword, I felt our longtime MT was far more deserving of it (I think many of us in the guild felt the same way). Also, the caption mentions the classes this item is restricted to; warriors and rogues, ok, but paladins? *Hunters*? A hunter wielding a Thunderfurry is called a huge waste in my book..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Left half just dropped off of geddon tonight.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is so frustrating. My guild has been doing MC runs for the past seven months. We get it down to the point where we can MC clear in less than four hours. Only the right side of the bindings have dropped for us once and it is getting frustrating that the only obstacle now is the left side of the bindings. I have gathered the mats necessary to complete this quest. All the elementium, arcanite bars and whatnot, and still no drop from Garr.<br /><br />I hate you Garr. I hate you so much! I just hope this coming Friday Garr should prove to be merciful and drop the binding required, otherwise I am going to weep in my pillow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Our guild just got both sides of the Bindings! Not sure what happens though... I'll see some time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My guild was running Molten Core last Saturday (10/21/06) and we killed Garr. My heart leapt in my chest, but I continued on, killing the rest of Garr's adds. When he died, there was the Binding! My guild leader was all calm like, &quot;Let's roll for Felheart,&quot; as the officers discussed the binding. It went to me. <br /><br />Less than thirty minutes later, we're killing Geddon, and he goes down. I'm not even thinking about the other half. All of a sudden, the 2nd half shows up in my inventory! I pressed my Ventrilo button but no words came out.. I was absolutely shocked. I hearthed to Silithus, picked up the quest, and got the Essence of the Firelord later in the night. <br /><br />Three hours after our run ended, I'd obtained all the Arcanite and Flux necessary, and I'll be getting the Elementium Ore from a friend. I'll get this on Wednesday! Since it's Allakhazam, people will wonder, &quot;What class? What role?&quot; I'm the Main Tank for Fidelis Legio on Earthen Ring Alliance.
