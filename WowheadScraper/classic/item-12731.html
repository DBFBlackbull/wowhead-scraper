I write from the point of view of a miner\/skinner who does not have Finkle's skinner, has the quest for the cap of the scarlet savant, and \"needs\" a pristine hide.\n\nI have a number of points to make,\n\n1.&nbsp; NEEDING =\/= DESERVING:&nbsp; you might NEED a pristine hide in the sense that it is for a quest reward for an epic, but you don't DESERVE it because you (usually) did not accompany the skinner on the 50 or so UBRS runs it took him to get Finkle's skinner.&nbsp; You did not put in an equal amount of effort towards skinning the beast in comparison to the skinner.\n\n2.&nbsp; Analogy to mining arcane crystals argument:&nbsp; for those miners who say you would give up arcane crystals if they drop on instance nodes, you make me laugh.&nbsp; From the point of view of a miner, I'll roll with other miners for the right to mine the node but there's no way I'm giving up the proceeds to a non-miner in a PUG just because they happened to be there.&nbsp; I definitely would not give up the loot if I had to go on 50 UBRS runs for the ability to mine it.\n\n3.&nbsp; \"The skinner would not be able to kill the beast without the group\" argument:&nbsp; the group is not there to help the skinner skin the beast.&nbsp; Each group member is there for their own selfish ends; to get their Dragon's blood, or their Magister's robes, or their own Finkle's skinner, or possibly to con some n00b skinner into letting them roll on the pristine hide.&nbsp; The next UBRS run I go on I will be aiming for both Magister's robes and Finkle's skinner.&nbsp; I do not expect rolling rights on the pristine hide if someone else skins it.&nbsp; If someone lets me roll on it it's because they're a sucker.\n\nThat about concludes my arguments.&nbsp; At the end of the day the skinners are in the right and those who would kick their skinners out of their guilds for keeping their own skins are in the wrong.&nbsp; That doesn't change the fact that you will have to face-off against 14 angry non-skinners every time the hide drops, but their cause is not as righteous as yours!

Consequently I try skin the beast every time it was killed. For my part I found a way most raids can live with. Before I skin I ask if the grpup is OK with my conditions. When I get the Hide I give the chance to roll on it to everyone in the raid who has the quest, if he's OK with paying me 40 G for my allowance. You think thats much ? Look in AH ! If evryone wants to roll without paying I'm not skinning it as I don't need the hide. \nIf you're saying thats greedy then think about it twice. For the quest you also need 10 arcanite bars. Did you ever find a miner that let the raid roll on a arcanite crystal he found (e.g. in Dire Maul)? Or a rogue that let roll on his pickpocketing loot ? Why should the skinner do so ? Because it took the group to kill the beast ? Then you should roll on every dragonscale we skin. The group has the advantage of the low price in comparison to the AH. Why should we skinners always be the losers ? There is nothing worthy to find or produce as skinner, but the hide.\nAfter I told my reasons every raidleader was OK with my plan !

It's like arguing that a Priest shouldn't use his Benediction unless you first pay him for the time and effort he spent getting it.&nbsp; You're expecting the Priest to work at his best when he is healing you in a group.&nbsp; That's what he's there for.&nbsp; It's something his class does.&nbsp; Likewise, you could argue that Druids shouldn't use Mark of the Wild, Mages shouldn't make water, and Warlocks shouldn't Soulstone unless you first pay them from the time and effort it took them to learn those skills and use them.&nbsp; Class skills, and other class related tecniques, weapons, etc., are meant to be used to benefit whatever party you are in, be it a PUG or a guild run.&nbsp; You don't hold your good weapons back for guild use only.&nbsp; You don't cast a Healing Touch Rank 2 in a PUG when a Healing Touch Rank 10 is called for.&nbsp; You use the skills that are called for as they are called for in every situation.\n \nConversely, professions are meant to benefit only yourself, and, quite possibly, your guild.&nbsp; Disenchanting stuff isn't like skinning The Beast, since the stuff that gets disenchanted in guild runs is stuff that was going to go to the guildbank but gets passed through a disenchanter first.&nbsp; It was never the disenchanter's property that they were giving up.&nbsp; Skinning Core Hounds isn't the same, since guilds are expecting you to use your professions for the betterment of the guild.&nbsp; I expect alchemists to make me potions, tailors to make me clothing, leatherworkers to make me armor, and blacksmiths to make me weapons (if I help farm for mats, of course...I'm not some lazy bastard).&nbsp; Skinners are expected to provide skins, Miners are expected to provide ore, and Herbalists are expected to provide herbs.&nbsp; That's expected of guildmates.&nbsp; It's NOT expected of PUG members and why an exception is being made for this item is beyond me.\n \nAs for the argument of Need before Greed, I NEED Mithril Casings for a quest I'm on.&nbsp; I'm not an engineer.&nbsp; Guess that means that I need to become an engineer since that's the ONLY way I can get those Mithril Casings, right?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; The game provides a way for me to get needed quest items...the Auction House.&nbsp; If I want a surefire way of getting them I can mine my own Mithril and craft my own Casings, but that would be foolish.\n \nWell what about if I want to make an Onyxia Scale Cloak using my Leatherworking but am not a Tailor?&nbsp; Guess that means I need to drop a profession and pick up Tailoring so I can make the Cindercloth Cloak that is needed for the Onyxia Scale Cloak, right?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Tailors need leather for some items, but they're generally not expected to be Skinners as well.&nbsp; Leatherworkers need Tailoring items for a few patterns, but they aren't expected to be Tailors usually.&nbsp; They can get those items at the Auction House, and I don't see why it's really any different for this one.\n \nThere is no Need in this case, since an alternative method for procuring the item in question exists.&nbsp; It's not like a BoP Epic, where Need before Greed does apply.&nbsp; This is a [b]material[\/b] that is used towards an end.&nbsp; It is not the end.&nbsp; And just as with all other materials, the profession that harvests the material deserves the material.&nbsp; It's not a weapon.&nbsp; Not a piece of armor.&nbsp; Non-skinners don't deserve it when it drops because the Hide is no different than any other scale or hide or scrap or leather that I harvest while playing the game.&nbsp; Just as with my Mithril Casing example, your two options are to either buy it on the AH or become a Skinner yourself.\n \nI mean, if I was in a PUG and was fishing and, heaven help us, Ashbringer suddenly came up out of the water on the end of my pole, should I ask everyone if they'd like to roll on it?&nbsp; After all, they were in my group.&nbsp; They get a shot, right?&nbsp; Sure they do...once I get to roll on everything the Miner gets in an instance, everything the Herbalists get, and everything the other Skinners get.\n \nThe mats go to the person that harvests them, end of story.&nbsp; From there, they can do whatever they want with it...pass it on to the guildbank, put it on the AH, or let PUG members roll on it.\n \nNow then, to say the least, my opinion is rather caustic and will not go well with a PUG, I'm sure.&nbsp; So instead of trying to jam my view down my PUGs' collective throat, let's focus on some solutions.&nbsp; First off, it's my opinion that no one except for 310 Skinners (harvesters that are entitled to the related mats) and the people that actually have those quests (people that need the mats) should be allowed to roll on the Hide, assuming a roll happens at all.&nbsp; If a class that can't decently use the reward from the quest claims to have the quest (i.e. a Warrior that has the quest for a Leather item), either kick them from the group for idiocy or for lying, take your pick.&nbsp; Either way they probably have no business in UBRS.\n \nThe earlier idea of asking people to pay for the service of Skinning and a chance to roll makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; Without the Skinner, they have no chance at it, and assuming it drops, they can get it at a VERY reduced rate, which makes everyone happy.\n \nIf you're not reducing the \/roll pool through one of those methods, the idea of allowing the 310 Skinners to roll at 100 and the rest at 75 or 50 makes sense, since the Skinners are providing a service and should get priority on the item.\n \nHonestly, while my view is harsh, I'm more than willing to compromise.&nbsp;","date":"2006-01-24T20:17:18-06:00","rating":22,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"As I see, people at 2006 had a lot of time for debates :D","creationdate":"2019-08-17T17:00:03-05:00","id":1323216,"rating":-9,"commentid":2694633,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"Xururuca","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"This is a bit complicated.

If Mage refuses to open portal in an instance to people and uses teleport leaving you behind, well he is a deek in your eyes, But he doesn't sign that he needs to do everything as you need him to do for you.","creationdate":"2019-11-06T04:27:13-06:00","id":1337757,"rating":-1,"commentid":2694633,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"IvikN","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"And as I see, you should off yourself, what is this &*!@#$% comment, no wonder you're -8, lmao.","creationdate":"2023-12-11T21:02:18-06:00","id":1656552,"rating":-1,"commentid":2694633,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"Reginleif","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Aichon","importedSubject":"Ideas"},{"commentv2":1,"number":9,"id":2694640,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Although I am nothing like the level required for this point to come into contention, I think I roughly see whats going on...\n\nThere are three things that lead to the Skinning of the Beast. Firstly, The Skinner (being the person who actually gets to skin the beast) must go through the effort of raising their skill to 300. This, though aparently not as time consuming as it could be...(Aparently some take 4 hours...which I am dubious about)...does take a certain amount of time and effort, which the other non-Skinners in the group have not had to do.\n\nSecondly, the Skinner must run UBRS or Zul'Gurub roughly 20 times to even see their respective +10 Skinning weapon. Assuming that there will usually be at least another person with you looking to obtain it, the maximum number of times you would have to run it would be 40, meaning that there is an average of 20 runs to obtain the Knife. Again, this is an amount of time and effort that the non-Skinners have to endure.\n\nFinally, you must run and Kill \"The Beast\" in order to obtain its skin. This is done by all in the party, including the Ranger, and though, for example, he may not cause as much damage as the Rogue or the Mage, sheer damage is not all that is required to kill things, but distraction, tanking and healing also leans towards this. \n\nTherefore, even with the lowest consideration of the points above, the Skinner will have had to have done twice the amount of work than anyone else. Therefore, I would (given the position of Raid leader) do the following:\n\n1. All the people CAPABLE of skinning the Beast (310 Skinning) AND require it for a quest\/epic item would roll off for it.\n\n2. If there are no people who can be in 1., then all people who require it for a quest\/epic item roll upon it, with an equal roll, as there are (according to the above point) only people NOT capable of skinning the beast BUT NEED The skin\n\n3. IF There are no people that can be described as either 1. or 2., a manual roll, where all those are CAPABLE of skinning roll on 100, whereas the rest roll on 75. This allows the effort the skinner put in to be shown in this essential \"Greed\" roll, as no-one actually NEEDs the Skin...\n\nJust My Two Cents Guys...Don't take it persoanlly...","date":"2006-01-24T20:17:18-06:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"IMHO, there is no right or wrong answer in this situation.

But so are you skinners, wanting to deny them the item they need for some of the best non-raid gear in the game as of now.\n\nI'll admit that my skinning character is only level 30 and that I no longer play it. My main is a Night Elf Druid with 300 herbalist\/alchemist, but that doesn't mean I don't know anything about the Hide or the trouble of getting it.\n\nOkay, let's see. The skinner goes to the trouble to getting skinning to 300 and getting the gear required for 315 to skin The Beast, so that means that the skinner gets the hide? This would be okay if there weren't other things involved:\n\n[b]Nine other people help down The Beast, because they're interested in getting the loot - including the hide.[\/b] (It's still loot regardless of the fact that you have to skin it first.) When this happens with any other mob, the loot is split - by rolling to determine who gets it. Why is this any different? 10 people collectively - not the skinner alone - down the mob to get what it drops. If you think you deserve it over the other nine people, go kill the damn boss alone without any help.\n\nAll of the analogies about other professions are completely illogical...do you form a 10 man raid to mine a thorium vein? Do you need a 10 man raid to pick a herb? No, [b]the herbalist or miner can do it alone[\/b], so that's why they're entitled to getting it.\n\nDo you know how much the Pristine Hide goes for on the AH, when it's even on it (I rarely see it up on my server, and it's not even undeveloped - it was the 2nd US server to open the Gates of AQ)? Yeah. Most of us don't want to pay that much. It's true that some items from other professions need to be bought to be acquired by people who do not have the respective profession, but they are not nearly as valuable. Arcane crystals, Black Lotus, yeah, they're not cheap. But they take less manpower to get - one person has to mine - and are far more common on the AH. You also don't need to get an extra item (Finkle's Skinner) to mine arcane crystals or pick black lotus. It's not fair that someone would have to go to so much trouble to purchase the material while the things it makes [i]aren't even all leather[\/i].\n\nHowever, I do believe that if say something rare like a Rich Thorium Vein or Black Lotus was found in a location that required 10 people to get to, then they have the right to demand to roll on it.\n\nAnd why the hell would it be a reward for picking skinning? Skinning is the [i]easiest[\/i] damn profession in the game - sure herbalism doesn't take much work, but it's easier to find what you need to gather from - while you're grinding levels it pops up right in front of you. How convenient.\n\nNo one wants to drop their profession to get skinning; at this point most players have put far more effort and gold into raising their profession than anyone has ever put into skinning. To say that they should get skinning if they want the hide is a really naive statement.\n\nAlso note that the hide isn't used only for leather rewards. Why would say a Priest or a Warrior have skinning? Yes, it does happen; if they're an alt or if they're simply skinning for money. But far more mail or plate wearing characters take other professions, because they're directly beneficial.\n\nProfessions are not meant to solely benefit yourself, your gold, and your guild. Alchemy can save wipes with potions and make your group more efficient with elixirs, for example. Engineering is the same, and repair bots are nice. In the expansion Tailoring gets a net. Gear in general helps your group do better - especially if you're a tank.\n\nOr, let's take everything by your logic: if people should loot things because they worked to get the capability to loot the said item, this should be true also: Rogues should be able to take everything in locked chests all for themselves because they worked up their lockpicking (someone stated earlier that this is not comparable to a profession because it is a skill that comes with a class; you have to work lockpicking up just as you have to any other profession, and it sacrifices money and time as Skinning sacrifices a different profession and having to get the Skinner. Both have their costs. There are a lot of 60 Rogues out there who have a very low lockpicking skill.); alchemists should get all of the loot from the Edge of Madness event in ZG because they have to make the elixir to start it; the highest DPS players in a group should get a higher percantage of the loot because they're contributing more to the possibility of successfully killing the mobs; tanks should recieve bonus loot from all of the other players of a raid because they have to earn more money to pay for repair bills; guild-led PuGs should take all the loot for themselves because they're the reason the others are there; healers should be able to demand whatever they want because they're the ones working to keep your hide alive; pallies deserve money when they cast Divine Intervention because they're giving up their lives for yours; hmm, what else? Yeah.

As such, if the pristine hide drops, people who have the quest for it should be able to roll for it because they helped the skinner reach the beast and kill it, and if the skinner needs for the quest as well, they should have just as much of a chance in the roll as the others.\n\nand skinners really shouldn't complain about that \"difficulty\" getting to 300, all they have to do is kill several beasts round their level, which is even encouraged by quests and such. if that's really a problem, maybe a game change should be considered....","date":"2006-07-22T04:58:35-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"creperums","importedSubject":"need before greed"},{"commentv2":1,"number":40,"id":3039460,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"As a skinner if this ever caused as much drama as I am seeing..

Any skinner who (after leveling and dedicating himself to the profession for so long and doing the endless runs to get the knife and obtaining the enchant and skinning again and again to see the damn thing drop) will let someone who contributed .01% to the massive event of the Pristine Hide materializing ACTUALLY ROLL on it, and actually hand it out ... well, that's an obscene level of philanthropy that I can't see myself obtaining.   \n\nIt's not cake to actually get a Finkle's and get the Hide ... anyone who thinks it is is a moron.

I just remember telling everyone \"loot the %^&* off the beast so i can skin and then we can summon Valthalak..\" Well yea, i go skin the beast and BOOM there's the pristine hide.\n\nNow the dilemma occurs. There was no drama following it or during it.. but however.. no one in the raid really cared that I kept it, 6\/10 in the raid had access to BWL\/AQ40 and whatnot.. and since Ive known most of these players from RL and ive played with some for about a year now we are all pretty chill about anything. Well, those that didnt care just kept on pulling and clearing to drak(decided to kill drak before we kill Val). There was however one person(a really good in-game friend of mine) who decided we should roll on it and sell it(700g+ on Burning Blade). Well, he was the only one that rolled since hes the only one who had a different opinion than 9 others. He demanded i give the hide to him since he wanted to sell it.\n\nSide note: The past 3 weeks I went on a farming extravagenza and made about 800g, coming to a recent total of about 1400g.

In fact, i bought him the Four of Elemental the other day(170g) to complete his Elementals deck without questioning if hed pay me back - I didnt really care, he is a good friend and he deserved it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3>The drop rate increased some time ago? Correct me if i am wrong.<br /><br />On Stormrage it costs around 100g now, not worth a lot. 6 months ago it was around 400-600g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7767</b></h3>A few helpful tips if you need this item:<br />1) You should ask everyone in the raid if they need the hide as well, this way you will no if someone ninja's it or not.<br />2) It may be a good idea to let the skinner know that you need the item beforehand so he/she isn't caught offguard by it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>netherbane</b></h3>Well, the reasoning for who gets the hide is pretty simple:<br /><br />If a skinner skins the regular mobs and gets leather, would you demand to roll for it since you helped kill the mob he skinned? No.<br /><br />If a miner mines dark iron in an instance, would you demand to get to roll for it since you helped him get to the vein? No.<br /><br />If a miner gets an arcane crystal from a vein inside an instance (seen it happen in DMe), would you demand to roll for it since it's so rare? Would you demand that all alchemists get to roll for it since engineers or blacksmiths can't use arcane crystals anyway? No.<br /><br />What if a herbalists finds Black Lotus in an instance, would you demand to roll for it since it's rare and expensive? No.<br /><br />And in these cases the one who found it didn't even have to get any special equipment to do it, so realize that when a skinner says the hide is his and you say it's not you are the greedy one. Sure, you helped kill the beast, but the skinner did just as much as you and then on top of that he got his skill to 300 and did at least a dozen UBRS runs just for the dagger. A skinner that gets the hide has put more effort into it than you, and thus deserves it more than you do. End of story.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I agree with the skinners 100%. If you want to roll on this item, give up your current profession and go take up skinning! What's that? You don't want to give up your current profession? Well of course you *!@#ing don't! You want someone ELSE to take up the profession, so you can just get the loot!<br /><br />If you roll on this, and you aren't a skinner, you're just trying to get a free ride. End of story.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Good afternoon gentlemen!&nbsp; After careful consideration of the facts at hand, I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with the skinners on this one. I write from the point of view of a miner/skinner who does not have Finkle's skinner, has the quest for the cap of the scarlet savant, and &quot;needs&quot; a pristine hide.<br /><br />I have a number of points to make,<br /><br />1.&nbsp; NEEDING =/= DESERVING:&nbsp; you might NEED a pristine hide in the sense that it is for a quest reward for an epic, but you don't DESERVE it because you (usually) did not accompany the skinner on the 50 or so UBRS runs it took him to get Finkle's skinner.&nbsp; You did not put in an equal amount of effort towards skinning the beast in comparison to the skinner.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Analogy to mining arcane crystals argument:&nbsp; for those miners who say you would give up arcane crystals if they drop on instance nodes, you make me laugh.&nbsp; From the point of view of a miner, I'll roll with other miners for the right to mine the node but there's no way I'm giving up the proceeds to a non-miner in a PUG just because they happened to be there.&nbsp; I definitely would not give up the loot if I had to go on 50 UBRS runs for the ability to mine it.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; &quot;The skinner would not be able to kill the beast without the group&quot; argument:&nbsp; the group is not there to help the skinner skin the beast.&nbsp; Each group member is there for their own selfish ends; to get their Dragon's blood, or their Magister's robes, or their own Finkle's skinner, or possibly to con some n00b skinner into letting them roll on the pristine hide.&nbsp; The next UBRS run I go on I will be aiming for both Magister's robes and Finkle's skinner.&nbsp; I do not expect rolling rights on the pristine hide if someone else skins it.&nbsp; If someone lets me roll on it it's because they're a sucker.<br /><br />That about concludes my arguments.&nbsp; At the end of the day the skinners are in the right and those who would kick their skinners out of their guilds for keeping their own skins are in the wrong.&nbsp; That doesn't change the fact that you will have to face-off against 14 angry non-skinners every time the hide drops, but their cause is not as righteous as yours! So feel free to ninja the hide and hearth in confidence!&nbsp; Think of me - your friend - SkinnerOne!1!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As I read all these comments above and had many disdussions with raidleaders, I realize that it will never be easy to manage.<br />I'm a skinner and I have a skill of 315. Consequently I try skin the beast every time it was killed. For my part I found a way most raids can live with. Before I skin I ask if the grpup is OK with my conditions. When I get the Hide I give the chance to roll on it to everyone in the raid who has the quest, if he's OK with paying me 40 G for my allowance. You think thats much ? Look in AH ! If evryone wants to roll without paying I'm not skinning it as I don't need the hide. <br />If you're saying thats greedy then think about it twice. For the quest you also need 10 arcanite bars. Did you ever find a miner that let the raid roll on a arcanite crystal he found (e.g. in Dire Maul)? Or a rogue that let roll on his pickpocketing loot ? Why should the skinner do so ? Because it took the group to kill the beast ? Then you should roll on every dragonscale we skin. The group has the advantage of the low price in comparison to the AH. Why should we skinners always be the losers ? There is nothing worthy to find or produce as skinner, but the hide.<br />After I told my reasons every raidleader was OK with my plan ! And every skinner I asked sees it the same way.<br /><br />P.S. When I'm taken to UBRS it's not for my skinning skill but as healer ! I already got it once and had no problems with the raid and a happy rogue who finally got it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Personally, I see the Rogue lockpicking skills as something else entirely since they are class-based, rather than profession based.&nbsp; It's like arguing that a Priest shouldn't use his Benediction unless you first pay him for the time and effort he spent getting it.&nbsp; You're expecting the Priest to work at his best when he is healing you in a group.&nbsp; That's what he's there for.&nbsp; It's something his class does.&nbsp; Likewise, you could argue that Druids shouldn't use Mark of the Wild, Mages shouldn't make water, and Warlocks shouldn't Soulstone unless you first pay them from the time and effort it took them to learn those skills and use them.&nbsp; Class skills, and other class related tecniques, weapons, etc., are meant to be used to benefit whatever party you are in, be it a PUG or a guild run.&nbsp; You don't hold your good weapons back for guild use only.&nbsp; You don't cast a Healing Touch Rank 2 in a PUG when a Healing Touch Rank 10 is called for.&nbsp; You use the skills that are called for as they are called for in every situation.<br /><br />Conversely, professions are meant to benefit only yourself, and, quite possibly, your guild.&nbsp; Disenchanting stuff isn't like skinning The Beast, since the stuff that gets disenchanted in guild runs is stuff that was going to go to the guildbank but gets passed through a disenchanter first.&nbsp; It was never the disenchanter's property that they were giving up.&nbsp; Skinning Core Hounds isn't the same, since guilds are expecting you to use your professions for the betterment of the guild.&nbsp; I expect alchemists to make me potions, tailors to make me clothing, leatherworkers to make me armor, and blacksmiths to make me weapons (if I help farm for mats, of course...I'm not some lazy bastard).&nbsp; Skinners are expected to provide skins, Miners are expected to provide ore, and Herbalists are expected to provide herbs.&nbsp; That's expected of guildmates.&nbsp; It's NOT expected of PUG members and why an exception is being made for this item is beyond me.<br /><br />As for the argument of Need before Greed, I NEED Mithril Casings for a quest I'm on.&nbsp; I'm not an engineer.&nbsp; Guess that means that I need to become an engineer since that's the ONLY way I can get those Mithril Casings, right?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; The game provides a way for me to get needed quest items...the Auction House.&nbsp; If I want a surefire way of getting them I can mine my own Mithril and craft my own Casings, but that would be foolish.<br /><br />Well what about if I want to make an Onyxia Scale Cloak using my Leatherworking but am not a Tailor?&nbsp; Guess that means I need to drop a profession and pick up Tailoring so I can make the Cindercloth Cloak that is needed for the Onyxia Scale Cloak, right?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Tailors need leather for some items, but they're generally not expected to be Skinners as well.&nbsp; Leatherworkers need Tailoring items for a few patterns, but they aren't expected to be Tailors usually.&nbsp; They can get those items at the Auction House, and I don't see why it's really any different for this one.<br /><br />There is no Need in this case, since an alternative method for procuring the item in question exists.&nbsp; It's not like a BoP Epic, where Need before Greed does apply.&nbsp; This is a <b>material</b> that is used towards an end.&nbsp; It is not the end.&nbsp; And just as with all other materials, the profession that harvests the material deserves the material.&nbsp; It's not a weapon.&nbsp; Not a piece of armor.&nbsp; Non-skinners don't deserve it when it drops because the Hide is no different than any other scale or hide or scrap or leather that I harvest while playing the game.&nbsp; Just as with my Mithril Casing example, your two options are to either buy it on the AH or become a Skinner yourself.<br /><br />I mean, if I was in a PUG and was fishing and, heaven help us, Ashbringer suddenly came up out of the water on the end of my pole, should I ask everyone if they'd like to roll on it?&nbsp; After all, they were in my group.&nbsp; They get a shot, right?&nbsp; Sure they do...once I get to roll on everything the Miner gets in an instance, everything the Herbalists get, and everything the other Skinners get.<br /><br />The mats go to the person that harvests them, end of story.&nbsp; From there, they can do whatever they want with it...pass it on to the guildbank, put it on the AH, or let PUG members roll on it.<br /><br />Now then, to say the least, my opinion is rather caustic and will not go well with a PUG, I'm sure.&nbsp; So instead of trying to jam my view down my PUGs' collective throat, let's focus on some solutions.&nbsp; First off, it's my opinion that no one except for 310 Skinners (harvesters that are entitled to the related mats) and the people that actually have those quests (people that need the mats) should be allowed to roll on the Hide, assuming a roll happens at all.&nbsp; If a class that can't decently use the reward from the quest claims to have the quest (i.e. a Warrior that has the quest for a Leather item), either kick them from the group for idiocy or for lying, take your pick.&nbsp; Either way they probably have no business in UBRS.<br /><br />The earlier idea of asking people to pay for the service of Skinning and a chance to roll makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; Without the Skinner, they have no chance at it, and assuming it drops, they can get it at a VERY reduced rate, which makes everyone happy.<br /><br />If you're not reducing the /roll pool through one of those methods, the idea of allowing the 310 Skinners to roll at 100 and the rest at 75 or 50 makes sense, since the Skinners are providing a service and should get priority on the item.<br /><br />Honestly, while my view is harsh, I'm more than willing to compromise.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Although I am nothing like the level required for this point to come into contention, I think I roughly see whats going on...<br /><br />There are three things that lead to the Skinning of the Beast. Firstly, The Skinner (being the person who actually gets to skin the beast) must go through the effort of raising their skill to 300. This, though aparently not as time consuming as it could be...(Aparently some take 4 hours...which I am dubious about)...does take a certain amount of time and effort, which the other non-Skinners in the group have not had to do.<br /><br />Secondly, the Skinner must run UBRS or Zul'Gurub roughly 20 times to even see their respective +10 Skinning weapon. Assuming that there will usually be at least another person with you looking to obtain it, the maximum number of times you would have to run it would be 40, meaning that there is an average of 20 runs to obtain the Knife. Again, this is an amount of time and effort that the non-Skinners have to endure.<br /><br />Finally, you must run and Kill &quot;The Beast&quot; in order to obtain its skin. This is done by all in the party, including the Ranger, and though, for example, he may not cause as much damage as the Rogue or the Mage, sheer damage is not all that is required to kill things, but distraction, tanking and healing also leans towards this. <br /><br />Therefore, even with the lowest consideration of the points above, the Skinner will have had to have done twice the amount of work than anyone else. Therefore, I would (given the position of Raid leader) do the following:<br /><br />1. All the people CAPABLE of skinning the Beast (310 Skinning) AND require it for a quest/epic item would roll off for it.<br /><br />2. If there are no people who can be in 1., then all people who require it for a quest/epic item roll upon it, with an equal roll, as there are (according to the above point) only people NOT capable of skinning the beast BUT NEED The skin<br /><br />3. IF There are no people that can be described as either 1. or 2., a manual roll, where all those are CAPABLE of skinning roll on 100, whereas the rest roll on 75. This allows the effort the skinner put in to be shown in this essential &quot;Greed&quot; roll, as no-one actually NEEDs the Skin...<br /><br />Just My Two Cents Guys...Don't take it persoanlly...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If i ever got the hide out of any of my skinnings u could just dream on off having it. i would never given this up for rolling or anything of that.. i have the first priority if there is noone else with the skinning knife and 300 skinning there.. this is no ordinary loot it is a bonus for us skinners that have grinded for ages for that knife, and actually selling it on ah.. there are not so many bonuses for skinners in this game.. so i would taken the hide and if someone started to whine about it /ignore leave guild.. every run that i have been on and someon asks me 2 skin the beast i have always got permission 2 keep the hide. and if someone refuses me then... snap.. leave... sell on ah or finish the quest.. thats it. its my decicion</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think this should go to anyone who can skin it, and if there are multiple people, they can roll on it. Also, if the people who can skin don't have the quest / aren't high enough to have the quest, they can greed roll like everyone else.<br /><br />As some people have said, if the person who ran UBRS up to, and possibly more than, 50 times to see the knife, and then that again to see the hide drop, and someone else wins the hide, it is unfair for them. Getting skinning up to 300 isn't easy, then finding someone to enchant your gloves for +skinning can be difficult as well. Just getting the last level of skinning and the enchant can cost 10g+, and that's if you find a nice enchanter. The time i got the skinning enchant, it ran me 15g.<br /><br />I can understand everyone wanting it, but as every skinner has said so far, go farm it yourself. I don't argue when some really sweet ore drops, or that we should all roll for the shard when no one needs the item.<br /><br />And for anyone doubting that the skinner wouldn't drop in 50 runs, both my friend and I have been on at least 50 runs each, and neither of us have even seen the dagger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I myself am a skinner.<br />And I got the proffesion for the sole purpose of making money because everyone who owns a 60, knows that it drains money like hell.<br />Getting both Finkle's and the skinning skill maxed out requires time and effort.<br />Therefor if I were to skin the Beast and get the epic Hide I would feel more entitled to it.<br />However like most people have pointed out, it's impossible to solo the beast. So to get the skin you depend on teammates to help you out. Teammates who prolly could use the skin just as well as you do. And to leave them empty-handed with the notion of letting them grind days if not weeks for the gold to buy it themselves, is kind of unfair to.<br /><br />I don't think there's any way this issue can be compromised so everyone walks away happy. As for me, I would let everyone roll for it. However master skinners with finkles should be benefited. <br /><br /><i>So while every non-skinner performs a standard roll let them for example do a custom roll between 1-130 giving them 15% more chance of winning the skin versus those who haven't put so much effort into the skill. Which is more than a fair bonus when we're talking about an item well worth over 1k gold.</i><br /><br />I know it sounds kinda dumb but i'm just trying to find a reasonable solution here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok first of all for all u people who say its not hard 2 get skinning up its not i admit that.But its not about eazy 2 get it up its simply u cant skin it u cant get it if theres another skinner in the group with 310 skinning shure he can roll ageanst me on it but people who tag along kill the dam thing then this gets skinned and say well u skinned it i get a shot at it its bull.its exatly as other people say if a arcane crystal is mined does the group get 2 roll on it no cas the miner can mine and they cant.As for the core leather from mc well that is a completly different matter because u do mc with a guilds not with a pug group <b>and that leather goes 2 making armor and things for that guild</b>.If u do ubrs as a guild 2 farm this item so people can get better items so b it.And for thoes people who think where greedy for taking this item think about ur profesion i bet u take items that other people can use for somthink.But all in all its the skinner who get 2 decide how it gets distributed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>and if any of u have a problem with this go on and challenge me on it</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So, pretty much the thing that makes sense to me is that --<br /><br />In a <b>GUILD RUN</b>: This Hide goes to the guild bank unless it's concensus that no one in the guild needs the Hide for one armor quest or another.&nbsp; If you #$%^&amp; about the Hide in a guild run when there are others in the guild that need it, then you can take the Hide and get a /gkick with it.<br /><br />In a <b>PUG</b>: The skinners roll to skin.&nbsp; End of story.&nbsp; Give the skinner a grats if he gets the Hide.&nbsp; If there's a genuine need for quest completion, talk with the skinner about it, and hopefully they're nice enough to give it to someone needy.<br /><br />It does take work, as in many URBS runs, to get the skinning knife that drops, and the skinner had decided to keep skinning instead of taking on another gathering profession that brings in a steadier income.&nbsp; If the group decides early on that if the Hide were to drop that it would be a group roll, great, but otherwise, the skinner has paid his dues for the Hide.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I agree with Caeruleas for the most part. And for the guy who posted above him (I forgot to look at your name) Yes, it does take the whole group to kill the Beast, but would you even ever SEE the hide drop if it wasn't for the skinner? Same with the miners and their crystals. Plus, skinners and miners SHOULD be able to keep whatever they skin or mine. I mean, you wouldn't roll on any rugged leather or black dragonscales or any ores/stones that dropped, so you guys think it's fair to roll on the hide simply because it's more valuable? Psh, and you think the minds of the skinners who to keep this are warped. Good luck getting far with that kind of logic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How manny times can the hide be skinnend by 1 person? is it a *once in a lifetime skin* like the quest says? or are there peeps who skinned it multiple times.<br /><br />and plz now the comments are clear lets not start spamming the *it droped we can all roll talk*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sure, non-skinners are greedy. But so are you skinners, wanting to deny them the item they need for some of the best non-raid gear in the game as of now.<br /><br />I'll admit that my skinning character is only level 30 and that I no longer play it. My main is a Night Elf Druid with 300 herbalist/alchemist, but that doesn't mean I don't know anything about the Hide or the trouble of getting it.<br /><br />Okay, let's see. The skinner goes to the trouble to getting skinning to 300 and getting the gear required for 315 to skin The Beast, so that means that the skinner gets the hide? This would be okay if there weren't other things involved:<br /><br /><b>Nine other people help down The Beast, because they're interested in getting the loot - including the hide.</b> (It's still loot regardless of the fact that you have to skin it first.) When this happens with any other mob, the loot is split - by rolling to determine who gets it. Why is this any different? 10 people collectively - not the skinner alone - down the mob to get what it drops. If you think you deserve it over the other nine people, go kill the damn boss alone without any help.<br /><br />All of the analogies about other professions are completely illogical...do you form a 10 man raid to mine a thorium vein? Do you need a 10 man raid to pick a herb? No, <b>the herbalist or miner can do it alone</b>, so that's why they're entitled to getting it.<br /><br />Do you know how much the Pristine Hide goes for on the AH, when it's even on it (I rarely see it up on my server, and it's not even undeveloped - it was the 2nd US server to open the Gates of AQ)? Yeah. Most of us don't want to pay that much. It's true that some items from other professions need to be bought to be acquired by people who do not have the respective profession, but they are not nearly as valuable. Arcane crystals, Black Lotus, yeah, they're not cheap. But they take less manpower to get - one person has to mine - and are far more common on the AH. You also don't need to get an extra item (Finkle's Skinner) to mine arcane crystals or pick black lotus. It's not fair that someone would have to go to so much trouble to purchase the material while the things it makes <i>aren't even all leather</i>.<br /><br />However, I do believe that if say something rare like a Rich Thorium Vein or Black Lotus was found in a location that required 10 people to get to, then they have the right to demand to roll on it.<br /><br />And why the hell would it be a reward for picking skinning? Skinning is the <i>easiest</i> damn profession in the game - sure herbalism doesn't take much work, but it's easier to find what you need to gather from - while you're grinding levels it pops up right in front of you. How convenient.<br /><br />No one wants to drop their profession to get skinning; at this point most players have put far more effort and gold into raising their profession than anyone has ever put into skinning. To say that they should get skinning if they want the hide is a really naive statement.<br /><br />Also note that the hide isn't used only for leather rewards. Why would say a Priest or a Warrior have skinning? Yes, it does happen; if they're an alt or if they're simply skinning for money. But far more mail or plate wearing characters take other professions, because they're directly beneficial.<br /><br />Professions are not meant to solely benefit yourself, your gold, and your guild. Alchemy can save wipes with potions and make your group more efficient with elixirs, for example. Engineering is the same, and repair bots are nice. In the expansion Tailoring gets a net. Gear in general helps your group do better - especially if you're a tank.<br /><br />Or, let's take everything by your logic: if people should loot things because they worked to get the capability to loot the said item, this should be true also: Rogues should be able to take everything in locked chests all for themselves because they worked up their lockpicking (someone stated earlier that this is not comparable to a profession because it is a skill that comes with a class; you have to work lockpicking up just as you have to any other profession, and it sacrifices money and time as Skinning sacrifices a different profession and having to get the Skinner. Both have their costs. There are a lot of 60 Rogues out there who have a very low lockpicking skill.); alchemists should get all of the loot from the Edge of Madness event in ZG because they have to make the elixir to start it; the highest DPS players in a group should get a higher percantage of the loot because they're contributing more to the possibility of successfully killing the mobs; tanks should recieve bonus loot from all of the other players of a raid because they have to earn more money to pay for repair bills; guild-led PuGs should take all the loot for themselves because they're the reason the others are there; healers should be able to demand whatever they want because they're the ones working to keep your hide alive; pallies deserve money when they cast Divine Intervention because they're giving up their lives for yours; hmm, what else? Yeah. Bottom line, unless you do something 100% on your own, you don't deserve 100% of the rewards: <i>that's how groups in raids work in WoW.</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Whoever can skin the beast should before raid should RR so that everyone knows before hand who gets to skin it.

BLAH BLAH BLAH&quot; Then hell, you go pick up the skinning ability and get finkles skinner and you win the roll and skin it yourself.

Well woth the effort...and oh yea...The quest reward aint half bad either.<br />Crinolaas -Guild-&gt;OathBound(leader)<br />Llane Server<br />Lvl60 Rogue</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are 2 different scenarios with the hide: PUGs, and guild runs.<br /><br />If a pug has a skinner, and they want to roll on the hide, tough luck. It is the skinners hide, and if there are multiple skinners, they roll for the ability to skin. Any PUG that tries to get a skinner to give away their hide is greedy at best- there is no way that everyone in the group has done the work to get 300 skinning AND the dagger. If you were on every run with the skinner, by all means, roll on it, but otherwise, just shut up. <br /><br />If, however, you are on a guild run, it is the SKINNER who is greedy to keep it. It is used for epic armor, and epic armor on a guildy is always a plus. Also, they're going to remember the fact that you sacrificed 500+ gold to help them, and help you in the future.<br /><br />Skinning makes less money that mining and herbalism FOR SURE, enchanting perhaps, a good engineer will make far more, and even leatherworking and blacksmithing can be played to generate more cash. <br /><br />One final point: THIS DROP MEANS AN EPIC FOR THE SKINNER, TOO. When someone complains that they &quot;need&quot; this drop for an epic quest, it really is very shallow. The cash generated from selling this item allows a skinner to BUY an epic- so really, EVERYONE &quot;needs&quot; this- it's not greed if the skinner wants his epic BOE weapon, no more than it is greed for the mage to want their cap of the scarlet savant.<br /><br />On BOTH my skinner and my non-skinner, THIS IS THE WAY IT IS, no argument. Ever. If I'm leader, I make it clear in the beginning. I've seen it drop twice- once on my skinner, once on my non. The first time was actually on my non-skinner. Skinner got it, we congratulated him. One guy complained, he was removed from the group and we summoned a guildy. Second time, I wasn't leader, won it, sold it, paid back a friend I had borrowed from.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if several ppl can skin the beast we roll. The one who wins the roll can have the skinloot. See it like this: Miners get arcane crystals and sell them. Skinners get pristine hide of the beast and sell it :P.</div>

Same manner you shouldn't be allowed to get Pristine hide without skinning, except AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the way i see it, a skinner wouldn't have been able to skin the beast without help from the rest of the raid taking it down first. even if he needs, then other people who need should be able to roll for it as well. some people run ubrs just so they can get a chance at that quest item, so they should get a chance at it, cause they kinda helped kill the beast for skinning anyways. a skinner claiming that hide just cause they skinned it is like an alchemist claiming an arcanite bar from a miner just cause they made the bar.<br /><br />also, skinning the beast is very different from mining or herbalism. It requires a raid to do, while mining and herbalism is very rarely done in groups just for the arcane crystals and such. In raid runs of BWL, elementium ore is not given to a miner just cause he could mine it, it goes to the guild bank or such so the entire guild raid profits from helping the miner get the elementium. As such, if the pristine hide drops, people who have the quest for it should be able to roll for it because they helped the skinner reach the beast and kill it, and if the skinner needs for the quest as well, they should have just as much of a chance in the roll as the others.<br /><br />and skinners really shouldn't complain about that &quot;difficulty&quot; getting to 300, all they have to do is kill several beasts round their level, which is even encouraged by quests and such. if that's really a problem, maybe a game change should be considered....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would like to point out to all the skinners who believe they are somehow entitled to this item just because they can gather it that you should now stop rolling on shards from BOP blues. If you get a 400G item because you can gather it then I can keep those thousands of 5-9G Large Brilliant shards I've created.<br /><br />And before you ask, when in a PUG instance (not too often anymore now that I'm raidign with my chanter) I do /roll on mined/picked/skinned items (general skins, or even most dragonscales, aren't worth it tho). If the gatherer objects then I inform him that he will no longer be recieving shards/essences/dusts from BOP drops as I am the one gathering them. Instead, should he win the roll, I hand him the vendor value of the drop as that is exactly the value of the drop to him and slightly more convenient as it doesn't take up bag space until he can make it to a vendor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First of all - from patch 1.10 it is a drop from The Beast, so anyone can have it even when he's not a skinner. Finkle's Skinner got 4% chance to drop - it takes me 29 UBRS runs to get it.<br /><br />When F'sS dropped I was the only one with skinning - group allowed me to get it. I retaliate this gift by skinning The Beast and passing on the hide. From this point ive got a new strategy (doing this before UBRS run):<br /><br />1) I ask the group: &quot;Anyone of you got Malyfous's Catalogue quest?&quot;.<br />2) I ask the group: &quot;Anyone of you got 310 or 315 skinning?&quot;.<br /><br />If 1st and 2nd answer is &quot;no&quot; - I inform them that ill skin The Beast for the hide and I wont let them roll on it. If 1st answer is &quot;YES&quot;, 2nd &quot;NO&quot; - I inform them, that ppl with the quest will roll the hide with me. If 2nd answer is &quot;YES&quot; - we roll before UBRS who'll skin The Beast.<br /><br />In the other hand: Pristine Hide is overpriced, as many items on AH. Im selling it for 150g each time I get it. Price should be equal to the effort needed to get it. If someone in the group want to sell it for more - he can always buy it from me.<br /><br />When Im on a guild run I always send the hide to the guildbank (if there is none). Our bank got GuildPoints for donations - and its 25GP worth, cause we've got 6 ppl with 315-skinning.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Sep 6th 2006 at 8:57am EDT by vetitus</i></div>

But simply going to make a sugestion should any of the &quot;Powers that Be&quot; ever see it ( I doubt it but hey you never know!)<br /><br />Dear Powers that Be would you please remove your head from your arse and simply make this item drop like normal loot so that this whole point of agravation and conflict will simply go AWAY. I'm sick of hearing whiny ^&amp;% people arguing over who gets what.<br /><br />To you &quot;Whiny ^&amp;% people&quot; you all need to get a life. You act as if this damn thing really exists its a game retards! If you dont get one the first time it drops then try again and quit frakin whining about it.<br /><br />Feel free to flame away I dont really give a flyin turd. I Got mine thanx to the guild and yeah I skinned it myself and no the idea that anyonelse was even entitled to roll on it never came up. Unlike the majority of posts I have seen here my guildies are not greedy gold mongering idiots. And if and when the one that another guildy needs drops she will get it no questions asked and i'll even bow before her as I hand it to her.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a skinner. I have been doing countless UBRS runs to get the Skinner - took me about half a year of RL time (got it yesterday). The drop rate of the knife is about 4%, and there are usually 5 people rolling on it (now less, because of the new dungeon limitation, but still). I lost 2 previous rolls.<br /><br />If you think it is easy to obtain 310 in skinning, think again. If you are pampered by your community and they work with you to ensure that you get the Skinner, then you owe that community and the Hide should go to community bank. But if you got there by your own effort, then you should have the last word when deciding what to do with the Hide. Nobody should have a right to *demand* a roll on that. They may ask for it nicely, but that's all. <br /><br />Btw, a somewhat similar situation exist in BRD when mining dark iron veins. You can get Blood of the Mountain from those. I have never seen a group grolling on the blood, the miner always took it for himself. And he does not even need a special tool to mine those.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You needed the raid to get there, so you all roll, regardless of how you got the item. If a rogues opens a locked chest does he get the loot? no. everyone rolls on it.<br /><br />The pristine hide is something everyone can use and without the raid help the skinner would never see one. So yes it should be rolled on.<br /><br />Also skinning is the most consistant money making gathering skill in the game... it doesn't yield high cash but it's consistant. Everyone expect alchemists use leather...engineering, tailoring, blacksmiths and of course leatherworking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am on the maelstrom server and am a memer of a mercenary guild, we are a good group and are very close to one another. Yesterday, 02/02/06, we were doing a UBRS run, and this is like my 15th run for ubrs on the char only to have the finkles skinning dagger ninja'd from me everytime it dropped. So my guild came in w/ a plan, all the rogues in guild would roll for skinner along w/ me (hunter). I have the woirst luck w/ rolls so when the beast died, skinner drops, and i roll need, of course i roll a 37 and the druid rolls a 67, so the rogues roll, and one rolls a 100. he says give to me and in THAT RUN the hide of the beast drops, nonone needs so i gave to that rogue :P. my comment to u all is HOW RARE IS THAT?<br /> if you ever get try to give to a druid, or rogue befor any type of caster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The problem with leather working is that you don`t have big recipes or something like arkanite or black lotus. You get nothing! Sure you CAN get Finkels or the sword from zg but this is like an enchant for mining it only helps you to skinn higher lvl mobs which drop the same #$%^ as low lvl (core leather is an exeption because of the raid group, so they can provide it to everyone for free).<br /><br />This is the white whale for skinners, everyone dreams of getting their hands on it. I would have dumped skinning much earlier if there wouldn`t be the faintest possibility for this one BIG skin job.<br /><br />After that I dropped skinning and mining and went for herb/alch. I wouldn`t dream of rolling on this . You can roll IF you are a skinner and have the knife or sword. Then its only fair, we always rolled bevor skinning.<br /><br />And yes I got it a long time ago and the PuG I was with had the same point of view.<br />Sadly I don`t wear the cap anymore, because t2 is better for a demo lock (but I`m thinking about getting the 2% crit hands and respec to destro ;) )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>By choosing Skinning as my profession, an item liek this is a reward for getting it to 310. If a ZG PuG has herbalists, the herbalists shoud roll on the bloodvine (if they can pick it). I don't see why I should get their rewards for pickiing up a profession. Miners who mine rich thorium veins should not have to roll with the rest of the group on anythign that could potentially come out. You chose your profession, now live with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i definitely think that if i skinned this i'd rather make over 1000g in the Ah than get a BP thats not much better than what can be dropped atm. haha. =\<br /><br />Any idea if they're changing the loot table for this?</div>

Hah, laughing at you now. First, the ninja skinners. Second, the rogue vs hunter and dagger ownership, and third, the stupid fact it won't always drop. There you go. How much complainers do we need for this instance?<br /><br />Don't know why I have to bring up, but I just thought I'd like you to hear the arguments about this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Why do you think the droprate is this low.<br />Ofcourse, because the item just entered the game, logical that it's droprate is low, cause not many people using WoW reader have gotten it yet.<br />It's not a fixed number, it changes every time.<br />So the actual droprate is probably not that low.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i have to agree with many of the comments above, and yes skinning is the easiest one to level, i got to 300 skinning in a day...but this is not the point...the point is like u said other professions are harder, correct, but you make a hell of a lot more money from them...i became a skinner just to get the dagger...just to get the hide...for both the cap and to be able to help others (in my guild and not) to attain that damn hide...but i do feel that if it does drop while i'm skinning, and i have yet to procure it ...i'd think that the skinner who actually sacrificed a profession for something that doesn't yield pratically any profit should not be blacklisted and omgwtfpwned when he takes it...<br /><br />grated i wouldnt do that, cause frankly, i'm 60, im not too worried about 1 drop when i can keep coming back for it...but yet u blacklist someone, who's the only one who took the time and effort to for one thing lvl the skill, another thing run ubrs tons of times just for the dagger, then skins for weeks just to get the hide to drop 1ce?<br /><br />it might just be me, but it just sounds like supreme jealousy and poor gamer-ship....if u realize how rarely it drops, the dagger AND the hide...and how much time it takes to actually get the damn thing....<br /><br />and someone said above if the skinner wants it then let them kill the beast...well if u want it become a skinner, and kill the beast yourself as well...honestly, stop complaining like its the end of the world, when one epic drop doesnt go your way</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Why does people say &quot;skinner leveld this skill, we deserve&quot; well for your info you idiots, without for example enchanting, you wouldnt have enchants, and those should have all green items, just because they leveld it? everything isn't about an profession. Like any other epic drop, this should be rolled for. <br />Those who needs it i mean.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Skinner keeps it. If someone cries that they have the quest, that's nice. Let them buy it off the AH. The only time I would consider giving someone a need on a boe epic is if I could see them equip it to make sure they dont run off and AH it. <br /><br />Who cares if you couldnt get to the beast without a raid. Is the raid doing UBRS for the sole purpose of skinning the beast? No. Theyre there for the usual reason. If a miner gets an arcane crystal in DM east, does everyone get to roll on it? If an herbalist picks an herb does everyone get to roll on it? If you skin a red dragonscale, does the raid roll on it? If an engineer gets the jumper cable recipe or an armorsmith get whatever recipe that is in undead strat, should they make that item for the entire group? I could go on.<br /><br />The only people I would let roll on this is other skinners.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Let me try and summarize this thread:<br /><br />1. Decide who has quests for the Prisitine Hide of the Beast BEFORE entering UBRS - these /roll need<br />2. If noone has the quest: either one of two classes of thought here. The 310/315 skinners roll for who will skin the beast BEFORE killing the beast, or the TPHB is open to all for /greed roll to all 10 raid members. Without the raid, the skinner has no chance of skinning the beast - this is i stark contrast to herbalists and black lotus; miners and arcane crystal; enchanters and nexus crystals; rogues and locked chests.<br />3. Guild run = obvious that it should be used for the advancement of the guild<br />4. if noone cares, noone cares<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble and stop reading now; the rest is either people boasting how they scored Finkle's Knife on their first run then also were fortunate to skin TPHB and sell it on AH for rediculous amounts, or people whinging about how unfair WoW is. Man, there are some people with a copious amounts of emotional baggage! <br />I should make a mouse that doubles as a stress ball.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">Who cares if you couldnt get to the beast without a raid. Is the raid doing UBRS for the sole purpose of skinning the beast? No</div><br /><br />Uhh I think you mean &quot;yes.&quot; I have no reasons to goto UBRS ever other then that hide. I'm a 60 priest, so of course I get /tells all day asking to heal a UBRS group.<br /><br />Why would I go if not a chance to roll on that item? And whoever compared it to a black lotus, I'd like to come play on your server cause a black lotus sells for 10g on mine not 500g+ like the hide does.<br /><br />A skinner needs a team to get that drop to drop. Plain and simple, all you skinners who are saying that only skinners should role on that (in a PUG enviroment) are being selfish. Without those other members you could not get the chance to roll at all. <br /><br />Again this is not a 10g item we're talking about or even a 100g item. It's a very high priced item that takes a lot of work and luck to even drop. If you're going to expect players that have no reason to go into UBRS to go in anyway, then you should expect them to get a fair shake when it comes to loot.<br /><br />Also, on the topic of skinners not making any money, I assumed correct me if Im wrong) that things like devilsaur leather sell for decent money? Am I incorrect? Skinning is a gathering profession, you cant compare that to alchamy potions people. You can compare it to herbalism or mining though... and I'm pretty sure skining and herbalism are in the same boat with selling what they collect.<br /><br />In the end this is something the group should agree about at the front door. I respect everyones opinion on this topic, and I'd like to know going into the instance that my 2 hours arent going to be wasted if the only item I need drops and I'm &quot;not allowed&quot; to roll on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If all those alchemists need Black Lotus for their flasks, and not every Alchemist is an Herbalist on the side, do they demand to roll on a plant just because someone harvested it near them? The fact is, Skinning *is* a profession. It takes up a slot, just like Mining, or Herbalism, or anything. Since we skin, we've lost the chance to do something else. Some of us chose this path for the Hide, yes. Some, just to make a quick buck. But you know what? I don't go around racking Herbalists for their Lotus, or Alchemists for their Arcanite Bars (which go for a good bit, don't they? And they're a *lot* more dependable than the Hide), so why should every Jack n' Jill outfit have a claim on something *I* sweated and bled for? You didn't want to <i>waste</i> a spot on Skinning before you went into UBRS, that's your own damned problem. Those of us who did know what's waiting in there, and we brought the gear to make use of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Since pristine hide is BoE it is greed only in a PuG raid. The reason is simple - all are doing equivalent job to raid UBRS, so all have to get equal chance for upgrade. Hide can be sold for money and anyone can get upgrade for money. If hide could be rolled only for those who has quest then others are automatically pushed off of LOOT. And LOOT is thats why they come in a PuG raid.<br />Those who dont agree with me pls answer a simple question: Why one PuG raid member should get priority over another just because he has a quest in his quest log which involve gettin this item?<br />And what are skinners talking about - that hide is going to one who skins the beast? U must be completely insane! To skin the beast u need 15 (id say 10 is enough too) ppl in a raid. Not only the one with skinning 315.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Mar 6 07:33:49 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Time will tell whether or not it's true, but Blizz did indicate they were increasing certain drop rates. It think that this sucker falls under that increase -- our first UBRS run after 1.10 dropped, I skin this sucker for the first time. It could be just luck ... However, tonight we did our second UBRS run and a Chromatic Carapace dropped. I'm thinking this indicates an overall buffed drop rate. Hopefully y'all who have been waiting will see more ...<br /><br />As for the PUG stuff -- well, in a guild everyone helps the skinner to get the runs for the knife, then helps him run again and again to get the Hide. In that case, the guild should have equal shots at it, like my guild did -- I was the lucky one who got it just because I had the quest and all the other components for the Breastplate. In a PUG ... well, that's a tough crap scenario for the other members of the PUG, in my opinion. Any skinner who (after leveling and dedicating himself to the profession for so long and doing the endless runs to get the knife and obtaining the enchant and skinning again and again to see the damn thing drop) will let someone who contributed .01% to the massive event of the Pristine Hide materializing ACTUALLY ROLL on it, and actually hand it out ... well, that's an obscene level of philanthropy that I can't see myself obtaining. <br /><br />It's not cake to actually get a Finkle's and get the Hide ... anyone who thinks it is is a moron. Indeed, if you want it, level your skinning, or help a guildie do it so you have an equal stake in it. Anyone in a PUG thinking a skinner owes them equal shot at the Hide -- well, hell, that's like thinking someone who gets a winning lottery ticket owes you an equal share of their winnings because you opened the door to the 7-Eleven for them.</div>

Since only the skinner can get it, and you cant BUY the corpse of the beast, then the skinner decides if he wants to allow people to roll on it. I chose to allow people to roll, got burned on my first hide. The next time i skinned it (maybe blizz did up the rate?) I didnt allow anyone to roll. <br /><br />Get Finkles, find a PuG, actually get to the beast and kill it without dying, and if you skin it, as a skinner since you dont get phat lewts from mining/herbalism, you might as well keep the skin.<br /><br />Ive talked to herbalists who brag they can make 100g a day from making major health pots and fire resist pots. Skinners make 1g per stack of 10. Its about time we get some favorable treatment.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got one from my 1st skinning try on te beast. Group leader asked whether we shall sell it, I asked what it is good for, he postet the breastplate and as a feral I declared need. everyone was fine with that.<br /><br />And it was basically a guild-run and it was not my guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Last night I was doing the Valthalak run for the final quest in the tier 0.5 quest chain, anyway, we were killing the beast, it was an organized raid of guildies and old friends(some from top-end guilds in full tier2/aq40 sutff).<br /><br />I was the raid organizer/leader and only skinner. well ive always had a &quot;vision&quot; of getting the pristine hide from the beast... well last night was a very lucky night. I just remember telling everyone &quot;loot the %^&amp;* off the beast so i can skin and then we can summon Valthalak..&quot; Well yea, i go skin the beast and BOOM there's the pristine hide.<br /><br />Now the dilemma occurs. There was no drama following it or during it.. but however.. no one in the raid really cared that I kept it, 6/10 in the raid had access to BWL/AQ40 and whatnot.. and since Ive known most of these players from RL and ive played with some for about a year now we are all pretty chill about anything. Well, those that didnt care just kept on pulling and clearing to drak(decided to kill drak before we kill Val). There was however one person(a really good in-game friend of mine) who decided we should roll on it and sell it(700g+ on Burning Blade). Well, he was the only one that rolled since hes the only one who had a different opinion than 9 others. He demanded i give the hide to him since he wanted to sell it.<br /><br />Side note: The past 3 weeks I went on a farming extravagenza and made about 800g, coming to a recent total of about 1400g. My friend in the raid decided that since &quot;i dont need any more money&quot; he should get the cap and sell it, because hes &quot;poor&quot;. well hes not poor. In fact, i bought him the Four of Elemental the other day(170g) to complete his Elementals deck without questioning if hed pay me back - I didnt really care, he is a good friend and he deserved it. I gave him 250g a few weeks ago for nothing since we used to run a guild and I sold a bunch of %^&amp;* i didnt need for a lot of money. <br /><br />Didnt think this would turn out so long, but the classic argument overcame ventrilo last night during our clearing of UBRS. &quot;If it wasnt for Exoris, we never would of got the hide(cause i can skin).&quot; Then it was &quot;If it was never for the raid, Exoris wouldnt have been able to kill the Beast and skin him.&quot; <br /><br />It really sucks that it had to come to the &quot;Chicken or the egg?&quot; theory. <br /><br />I still havent given him the hide, for the sole purpse that I may want the cap for my crit set. And for anyones concern, he is a 60 hunter in 8/8 GS and 3/8 DS with all epic jewelery.<br /><br />If worse comes to worse, ill sell it and split the cost 50/50 with him... but then there comes more complications of &quot;how about the other 8 people in the raid? Dont they get a cut of the deal to?&quot;<br /><br />Edited, Tue Apr 18 10:21:26 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think it should be the people who actually needs it who should roll? Where did all the nice people go? Why is everythign about epixxx now?<br />If someone could actually use it, and not sell it, shy should they go skinning if they are a mage or something? then they'll never get the chance to get that cap? You call that fair?<br />And hey. It's easier grinding 500 gold than getting this, cause it's 100 runs before it drops, lets say 1 a day, that's 100 days before you get it, who wouldn't be able to gather 500 gold in 100 days? So all you who &quot;But we should get it because we skinned it&quot; screw you, i would still roll if i had the chance. Not to sell, but to really use!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay, everyone has different ideas as to whether the skinner gets the hide or not. Bottom line is make sure you get your group to agree on who gets/rolls for the hide BEFORE you go in to get it. If you don't like the group's decision, leave the group and find another.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vlaka</b></h3>Absolutely and positively boggles my mind how this thing is nowhere to be found on Yojamba. But then again judging by the amount of botters and cgf's on the server it makes sense they'd hoard this until someone either uses real cash via some dodgy website to sell or once in a while test the water on the AH with ridiculous pricing...Disappointing.</div>
