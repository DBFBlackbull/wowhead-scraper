This is more than most likely a bug.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where do you use them it says you cant use that here when i try to use it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I heard only Engineers are able to trade 40 tickets to get this schematic.. much like the quests only Engineers &quot;may see&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>how much does this sell for? im betting atleast a few g seeing as this is a 50 stack each</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The mats are pretty cheap and are really easy to sell, I made about 20g in the first 10 mins after I got the scematic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just went up to a big tonk in the fair and right clik the control console and it said summoning rc tonk... but nothing happens and i cant move at all i can turn and blink out of it but im still stuck like rooted to the ground or something.... wtf?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Be sure to know that the Schematic is Bind of Pickup, so when you have turned in 40 tickets and recieved it in your bag, it's soulbound. This chould be a real pain in the ass if you is planning to get the Schematic for someone else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>do the crafted tonks work? above post stated the old tonks at the fair are bugged&nbsp; was wondering if the same was true for the player crafted tonk controllers</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>they work. Can't drive them too far away from yourself but they work just fine. Just made one and was using all the abilities. It all works. Do have to wait a few seconds before moving after you summon one or it breaks and you get stunned. Definitely works.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just made this and after reading in here I was worried it wouldn't work right.&nbsp; I decided to try it anyhow, so I went to Goldshire to mess around and when I tried it (with my pet still active) my pet was automatically dismissed and the tonk appeared and worked flawlessly.<br /><br />When I was done I was able to use my whistle to get my pet back with no problems.&nbsp; No stabling needed.&nbsp; It appears that Blizzard has fixed the problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess I'll have to test out my Mind Control cap now and see if it has been fixed yet as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I use these guys in the water. It makes it much more fun. They &quot;swim&quot; just like your character does. For the guns to lock on you have to be moving towards your target. Also a peculiar bug, that makes it more fun... when you lay a mine down in the water it goes all the way to the bottom of where ever you put it. If you drive directly over it, even if you are 100 ft above it in the water, it still detonates. It makes the mines much harder to avoid, especially if you are in a place like the vile reef. <br /><br />Submarine tonks FTW!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just thought i'd say once you have a flying mount, Check out the large flat floating islands in Nagrand, They are perfect for Tonk royal rumbles, Just have every player in the center and you have full range of the whole floating island.<br /><br />Much &lt;3 For the Tonks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I noticed the attack button but everytime i click it, the words &quot;cannot attack while stunned&quot; is this a glich or am i just not suppose to click that switch lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i like the tanks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been able to use it in instances, but if you scout too far ahead it breaks and you get stunned. Also it seems to not see the mobs when you get too far away, Tried to use it to see Ras in Scholo and Ras wasn't there yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>They can only be used outside and in instances, and capital cities count as indoors. Also if you make a lot, its really fun to get a bunch of your friends and use it somewhere, even more fun than the Darkmoon Faire because you choose the course you play on. I highly recommend getting the pattern because its easy to get, you can sell them for about 5 gold each, and you can play with friends. Only downside is it has 50 charges :\</div>
