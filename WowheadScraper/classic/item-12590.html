With 5 sunders on the mob this can be between 900 and 1400 damage, depending on there base armor. Also, if you have a 4 or 5 point evicerate then its a simple matter to just hit the button and bam, 1700 damage, plus then there is the damage from normal crits...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Windwalk</b></h3>As a rogue, you're going to want to put +5 damage exclusively on a main hand dagger, and on no other weapon.<br /><br />Crusader, +15 agility, and lifestealing are all better choices on a sword, mace, or fist weapon.<br /><br />In conclusion, if this is your offhand weapon, slap +15 agility on it; if it's your main hand weapon, +5 damage is great. As a warrior, I would recommend either crusader mainh and/crusader offhand or crusader main hand/+15 strength offhand. Obviously, strength is much more beneficial to a warrior than to a rogue, even if the warrior isn't Bloodthirst specced.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bornmx</b></h3>Did a UBRS run yesterday, was hoping for the MH Dal'Rend, I was using in my main hand Sword of Zeal and in my off-hand, the OH Dal'Rend.<br /><br />Rend went down and both the MH Dal'Rend and this dagger dropped... i was stuck :(:(<br />cause i was thinking of turning back to dagger pvp spec, but i had no good daggers.<br />and also i have tried so hard to get the MH Dal'Rend, well i being the only rogue rolled need on the dagger and omg won, now i was all happy (but not greedy) so i passed on the sword i have spent so long trying to get. <br /><br />this dagger was so worth it, now with this in my off hand and The Lobotomizer in Main hand, and both with +15 agil, ganking and pvp is so much fun 2 shotting lvl 58 mages,<br /><br />gl to all that want this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7700</b></h3>Weapon is a toss up for a rogue and fury warrior. Weapon benefits the warrior more because the rogue will replace it faster. The weapon chance on hit is amazing, 3 secs of full criticals and not being able to miss. Rogues have a 10% chance to miss vs. warriors having a 25% chance to miss.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LordRamza</b></h3>(that's me up there in the picture)<br /><br />Dropped on my first UBRS run, didn't need it but rolled for greed and got 100.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What the hell are you guys talking about? This is clearly, 100% of the way, a Pally weapon! Us, with our super dual wielding abilities can like, wild THREE of them at once!<br /><br />But seriously, this is a rogue weapon. Whenever I go to UBRS, I'm Master Looter.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The troll - sensible user ratio in the comment section of Thottbot is going off the scales. I seriously wish people would calibrate their sarcasm and flame/trollbait detectors before reading/posting. When someone writes &quot;Hunter weapon lolz!11oneoeneleven&quot;, maybe he's not being serious, eh?<br /><br />Anyway. If you're a hunter and roll on this against a rogue or some other melee class that will OBVIOUSLY make better use of it than you, you are officially one dumb sack of *!@#. Get Barbabarous (sp?) Blade, Peacemaker, the seriously overpowered Ice Barbed Spear or what ever.<br /><br />You others, stop the hating. You'll find greedy, stupid $%^&amp;s amongst every class in the game.&nbsp; Though it seems the hunter class has the majority of dumbasses.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>And ppl shud stop @#$%^ing about Rogues getting everything, if u check the %'s SC drops the least of the set armor and is very hard to get as a set, also the Barman Shanker, the best blue main hand dagger can take up to 25 stealth runs in BRD to drop, also, the best Rogue weps are so hard to get Perdition's blade for example drops of of Ragnaros now if a Rogue has worked hard to enough to get to and kill Raggy then the rogues deserve to be the ones getting the Epic Daggers Designed for their class with bonuses to crit chance and high DPS warriors go use SWORDS u look like retarded rogue wannbes with dagger so dont even bother roling on these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I know that there is a slim chance ANYONE is going to read this, but, should you be one of the lucky few whos eyes are graced with the information bestowed here, please read carefully, and share this&nbsp; information with your less fortunate peers. <br />The facts about Felstriker are as follow<br /><br /><ul><li> It drops very rarely<br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li> The proc which is confirmed to be roughy 5% will activate about once a fight, much as the Mace Stun Effect does<br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li> When it does proc, the attacks made in the next 3 seconds have a very high critical chance rate, for a rogue, that means nearly 100% chance to crit (while it is unconfirmed, it is roughly +75%)<br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li> It is a dagger, designated for One Hand<br /></li></ul><br />This dagger is, as it should be, a very appealing weapon to Rogues.&nbsp; However, its nature makes it more useful to Mace Spec. Rogues than Dagger&nbsp; Spec.&nbsp; My advise is switch to mace should you aquire it.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, just because it is nice for rogues, doesn't mean it is a rogue only weapon.&nbsp; This dagger would make a very happy warrior.&nbsp; The threat generation is peerless, and the kind of damage 3 seconds of criticals means is very attactive.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is however NOT a dagger for hunters, shaman/paladin, casters, or druids.&nbsp; Shaman/Pallies do not get enough hits off in 3 seconds for this to be of use, and Hunters most defenitely will not hit with a mellee weapon and get any bow attacks off in 3 seconds.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS.&nbsp; Rogues.... dont use Edward's Hand.&nbsp; Its for shaman/pallies</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just a normal UBRS run, (probably my 5th) I was just going to complete the quest for blackhands breath and didn't expect to get anything out of a UBRS run. BOOM this thing dropped. Of course i didn't think i would get it and i lost the roll to a hunter, however, it wasn't a retarded raid so the leader got the hunter to give it me! 60 dagger rogue :) I was happy, it was 1am on christmas too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hi peep....just got this weapon in ubrs.&nbsp; Was getting mats for a heartseeker... had everything but 6 arcane crystals. So it was quite a relief.&nbsp; I have had the dagger for about 1 week.&nbsp; This thing procs a ton.&nbsp; At least once a battle.&nbsp; But there have been multiple occasions where it has proced 3 times in a row! (9 secs of crits if the mob lasts that long) It was stated earlier that the proc only works for the dagger.&nbsp; When it goes off, my offhand weapon currrently &quot;ShadowBlade&quot; crits also. as well as all my ability's like SS, BS &amp; Evascerate.&nbsp; Since I got this dagger, i've changed my strat a bit.&nbsp; If i gain a combopoint back after a finishing move...i use it for improved slice and dice in case the weapon procs.&nbsp; And to the comment that you can never use it for backstabs cause you cant get into position is BS! If you are with a warrior that knows how to hold agro you will never be in front of the target.&nbsp; If you do pull him do a simple feint and he will turn right back around.&nbsp; One minor disadvantage is i have had 5 combopoints... turned on &quot;ColdBlood&quot; to evacerate and before i could use it the dagger proced.&nbsp; So a bit of a waste there.&nbsp; Soon as I get grandmarshal this thing is going to offhand.&nbsp; procs way to much to get rid of. Throughout my 2 years of playing this game, there are 4 weapons that have a good Proc chance. They are: Doombringer, Thrashbalde, Shadowblade, and this dagger.<br /><br />One note for hunters: I have a 60 hunter also and in my opinion 2H weapons are best for hunters.&nbsp; If you do go into melee combat you will get the most damage with a 2H weapon and raptorstrike. Goodluck and Good Hunting!<br /><br />I'm on Az'djol Nerub Server Char name is Breezze if you got soem questions!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you are a Rogue who is lucky enough to get this, you should be proud. Dropped for me today, and won it with a roll of 30. (Only two Rogues in raid, and it was designated for Rogues only to roll.)<br /><br />Why is this such a great weapon? Apart from the proc being MUCH better than the Barman shanker, this weapon has THE highest min-max damage pre-MC. Due to the weapon speed fix a few patches back, this is THE best dagger until you can get your hands on an MC epic.<br /><br />This is why it should never go to a Warrior. I'm not arguing that a Warrior could use it well, but I am arguing that a Rogue can use this to it's full capacity.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1.10 Patch Notes confirmed it has an incresed drop rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this a couple of days ago, and I can tell you, it is much better for a sword rogue than a dagger rogue in the offhand. When it procs sword rogues have 30% increase to critical strike damage, and if you have a full energy bar you can get off at least 2 Sinister Strikes, which will crit. With 5 sunders on the mob this can be between 900 and 1400 damage, depending on there base armor. Also, if you have a 4 or 5 point evicerate then its a simple matter to just hit the button and bam, 1700 damage, plus then there is the damage from normal crits... This weapon is a beauty for a rogue, and if a hunter rolls, then someone should /slap him a couple of thousand times while spamming org. And also I agree it would be a very nice tanking mainhand, helps for keeping aggro up. Fury warriors would benefeit from this weapon too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>16 runs after patch and still nothing, a guildie got it and it's damn amazing, pull a 3 dot evis and you got a free 1000 dmg.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it is the best offhand dagger in game..PERIOD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Would you be able to get about .92 or .98 speed if you enchant gloves with the Minor Haste, pop Blade Flurry then slice and dice during combat?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My main is a Warrior. He has 300 dagger skill (when he used to be arms/fury spec) Would I roll on this dagger? Hell no.<br />If any of you play a dagger spec rogue, you would realize there is not a hefty selection of good daggers out there. (unless you are running MC on up)<br />Even though there are daggers with stats that enhance a caster. To me, Daggers are rogue weapons. What other class requires you to have a dagger in your main hand in order to use some of the skills. None. <br /><br />Daggers = Rogue. Nuff said</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was ML and only 2 rogues in the group.&nbsp; everyone else thankfully let only us roll.<br />i rolled a 21<br />i said &quot;f$%#&quot;<br /><br />he rolled a 9<br /><br />i was literally shaking in my chair as i alotted it to myself :)<br /><br />looks like dagger spec again</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Definitely. Duel-wield those suckers, which should be possible as I can't see a 'unique' sign in there, and see a very unhappy target.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'd assume that the proc on this weapon simply increases hit and crit chance by 100% each for the duration of the spell, but I wonder if it makes your attacks unable to be dodged, parried, or blocked.&nbsp; This is unrealistic, but I'd like to hear from someone who has the dagger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is by FAR the best dagger in the game for ROGUES! If you are lucky enough to duel wield these suckers you're crit rating goes through the roof. It procs quite often alone, but with 2 its like a machine gun. Add blade flurry and slice and dice and you will be a crit machine. This dagger is incredible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im a DW fury warrior, i while running an UBRS to get some guildies Ony attuned, this drop, and since only 4 melee were there (1 prot spec warrior, me, and 2 resto shammies), it defaulted to me. i was wondering if anyone knows the proc rate of this in the offhand, because i was using eskhanders MH claw and frostbite OH, and is it worth the loss of 30AP?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have 2x Felstriker on Arthas. 1st one I got, 3 days later I got my Finkles, week later Felstriker drops again WITH Dal Rends Main hand. All the rogues rolled&nbsp; since it wasnt Unique. I won it with an 89. Anyone else on Arthas have 2? By the way its so incredible seeing it proc continuously with about 10+ crits. Its unexplainable. Great Weapon!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes i completely agree this would be a great rogue weapon.&nbsp; But it would also be very nice in the hands of a fury war.&nbsp; Think about it. Instant crits for 3 seconds... means instand flurry of increase speed of 30% and now with new patch also means instance rampage +200 attack power all of that equals a metric f ton of damage! So rogues and ONLY fury wars should roll on this, no other spec of wars</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>omfg i was on a run of UBRS, i was the only rogue in the group and felstriker was the only thing i was after. After killing rend, it dropped, i was like :) YAY I FINALLY GOT IT. NOTTTT.<br />there was a dumbass hunter in the group that needed it 5 mins after i did. And it was funny because the leader just switched the loot from master loot to group loot right before the fight. &amp;*!got said he didnt know there was a rogue in the group otherwiase he would have given it to me but he lied, little bastard<br />all u hunters that think u need daggers, or even this dagger, go die, go to hell and die. there are WAY better weaps in game for a hunter besides a damn dagger that your only gonna use 10% of the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This dropped of Rend when I was running UBRS today.<br /><br />I am a fury warrior, and could've used this, but it was a rogue in the group, so I picked greed to let him have it, BUT he didn't pick need and a priest won it on a greed roll.<br /><br />Pfft, should've picked need &gt;.&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The dagger has not been nerfed.<br /><br />I have been using it for a *very* long time and it has not been nerfed. If anything, with the new rogue changes and talents since TBC, it procs even more. Sometimes 2-3x a fight in pve.<br /><br />In pvp, it doesn't seem to proc as much, but consider this...how long do you spend hitting a creature in pve vs a single target in pvp?<br /><br />That's the difference, right there.<br /><br />You were just unlucky and probably didn't notice when it did proc. Changing colours in the combat log for spell effects, etc. does't show the proc so it's not that easy to really keep track of it.<br /><br />Using the built-in combat scrolling text, you can see when you gain it and when it fades...<br /><br />Rips through casters and warriors alike, Mutilate helps this dagger shine in both PvP and PvE incredibly well. Lv65 and still goin' strong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On hit just means a CHANCE for the effect to proc on hit. It's probably around 5-10% chance to proc every time you hit an enemy with that dagger. Also, every ability that's used during that time will critical as well, which means rogues dual wielding and spamming sinister strikes could lay down at least 5 hits that all critical in that 5 seconds, not just 1 or 2 hits from the dagger alone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><br />In my oppinion this definitely is NOT rogue weapon.. there are plenty of better weapons for u guys in MC/BWL/AQ40</div><br />Lmao! are you serious? This weapon is the most rogue weapon you can find? Your saying that theres plenty of other weapons in MC and stuff eh? What if you dont have time to do MC and stuff and are a casual player? There are plenty of other warrior rares in these dungeons for you so why dont you shut the heck up and go get a blackblade of shahram or a runeblade of baron rivendare. Lol, not a rogue weapon my ass</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First let me say that nowhere on this dagger does it say &quot;Class: Rogue&quot; or &quot;Class: Warrior&quot; therefore it is not meant specifically for either class.<br /><br />Both fury warriors and rogues could put this weapon to great use depending on their skill, so stop QQ about how it's better for your class than another.<br /><br />Its proc is one of a kind and it's a very rare drop, so plan ahead with your group and decide who can put it to best use WHEN and IF it drops.<br />Then whoever gets it, gets it.<br />If it's you, congrats!<br />If it's not, lern2playkthxbye.<br /><br />All the arguing on here is making this sound like the thott forums...<br />I might as well say &quot;Huntar wepun lollololol!111!eleventy1!one&quot; and be done with it. =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i use Thrash Blade now, which has extra attack chance on hit.<br />When your swing with THIS weapon lands there is a random roll being made and if its sucessful ALL your attacks in the next 3 secs will land and treated as crits, even if you use your bow in that 3 secs. <br />I think chance on hit means when you land a swing with the weapon, because i sometimes get an extra attack with Thrash Blade, even when the mob is stunned and i am not hit in that period of time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I agree to the fact that you can proc within another proc...<br /><br />Tryied that too with the thrash blade, and also with the proc from Frostblade...<br /><br />The dagger dropped on our server too, It may not be that rare after all :)</div>

I would concede that a Rogue was equally deserving if not best suited for this weapon.. <br /><br />That being said, don't tell me it's not a caster daggar, considering Shaman might get the full use out of the proc regularly with Windfury (gain 2 additional attacks on 20% of your successful strikes) and even Flurry (30% additional attack speed for 3 swings after a criical strike.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This dropped for me about 4 days ago. My heart began to palpitate when I saw it. I was the only rogue on the run but I did have some competition from a fury warrior and a few others who also couldn't resist the gleaming goodness of it's purple godliness.<br /><br />When they called need rolls I /roll’d as fast as I could, the result was a roll of 98 – far above anyone elses roll. The people I was raiding with are a bunch of great guys and quickly recognized the significance of my win and kindly chimed that perhaps it was time to respec out of swords and into, oh I don’t know, daggers?<br /><br />Of course I did. <br /><br />This weapon is a pure blessing. I am not insanely geared (a few epics at best) so right now this dagger sits in my mainhand until I get something better suited for large backstabs. However, even with a max damage of only 101 it still has the ability of placing quite a bit of hurt onto the unsuspecting backsides of alliance players and hostile mobs all the same. With my gear and a few generous buffs it’s not uncommon to see ambushes in 1900s and backstabs in the 1600s. If that doesn’t kill a clothie the insane proc rate of the Felstriker, resulting in a hail of high number white damage and sometimes yellow if timed right, certainly does.<br /><br />It’s a great dagger and I look forward to using far into the future. <br /><br />Abjects, Proudmoore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For rogues in guilds doing Onyxia, ZG and MC and not yet in BWL or harder instances (or guildless rogues), this is the best off hand dagger you can get. It is BETTER than Core Hound Tooth and Nightmare blade, for example. So it is basically a damned good off hand for any rogue. And it sucks as a main hand for rogues. <br /><br />I would laugh very long, hard, and loud if any fury warrior needed on this. Rogues can use: 1h swords, daggers, maces, and fist weapons.<br />Warriors can use: Everything.<br />There are plenty of WAY better alternatives for fury warriors, and I have not to this day seen ONE fury warrior with a dagger. If I had, I would have lol'd.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Procs in this game work this way- <br /><br />Procs work on time intervals set up for the specific weapon, so if you hit more you will not proc more, for example, when you proc once, you will only have another chance to proc after the alloted time has passed. It is the same way on all weapons with procs unless they are passive abilities. And i agree with the guy a ways below me, why need crit SS's when you could get a crit eviscerate which will add to 800 more damage than crit sinister strikes, hehe. That and this weapon better not look like a christmas tree when equipped. &gt;&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ON Hit. Consider it like, you have a 50%(waay exaggerated) to proc. So it'll take approx 2 hits with your DS to proc. Once it procs, then all of your attacks with your weapons will now be criticals. What's not to understand? It procs, then you've got 3 seconds to mass spam SS/evisc/BS</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wanted to kick myself when I saw that the premade rogues were given felstriker. Instead I choose a warrior and a lock. Anyways maybe someone could test this. Run BRD Emp until ironfoe drops then equip it and see what your dmg looks like. Probably nothing spectacular but there is the chance of both weapons proc-ing at the same time, so that would be a minimum of three criticals. Someone proved that Ironfoe can actually proc off of its proc so thats a possibility of five crits just like that. Better than this is if someone enchanted both with crusader, and all three proc-ed at the same time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Its a Rogue and Warrior weapon - reason why - It only crits on MELEE attacks. For casters this is completely useless. Hunters - doesn't help you with ranged attacks so don't even start taking about your massively damaging ranged crits, yes you have em, no this won't get you em. A guildie of mine who has the dagger and is a hunter found that out the hard way, he's got a dagger that any rogue or warrior would kill to have - but is pretty much useless to him.<br /><br />Warriors and Rogues can really benefit from this dagger. I can possibly see this for a feral druid but they should be be rolling after the rogues and Warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Enhancement shammies can have a go at this too. With Flurry and the +22% dmg to Windfury, this would do somewhere around 1400 dmg in proc of the dagger (just guessing since I know the crit of a Windfury on similar daggers is about 250 with talents), and that's one handed as compared to a 2H on an Enhancement going for about 2400. Now if people think that's just a 400dmg difference, don't forget to add to the fact the shaman is getting 2000+ AC from wearing a shield with this plus it gets 2x the amount to proc because it's twice the speed of an good hitting 2H.<br /><br />The damage I mentioned isn't garunteed, that is hoping for Flurry to proc, then the dagger the hit after, then Windfury to proc in the 4 seconds after that and the such.<br /><br />However, for the 2H (I am basing this off of my use of Fist of Omokk until I respecced to Restore) to do it's 2400 dmg, you have to hope that every single hit of your Windfury is a crit, which is begging for a lot.<br /><br />And no, it's impossible to get a 5K dmg Windfury, silly Alliance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>*Chance On Hit*: This means that on each successful hit that you land on a mob, you have a *chance* to proc(process) that effect. It is *not* an every time thing as mentioned previously. In my experience, most procs are somewhere in the general area of 5%, so every 20 successful hits or so, this special effect would take effect. I'm fairly sure it can proc on both normal hits and special moves. As far as the 1 hit per occurance thing... you might only get 1 normal hit in, but you could probably get at least two skills off in that time, depending on your class. What surprises me is that everyone is focused on getting critical sinister strikes rather than critical eviscerates. I'd personally rather turn a 900 into an 1800, than a 190 into a 380.</div>

If the Felstriker falls along with the Tribal Guardian, I'll let you have the Tribal Guardian and the Shadowcraft Tunic if you let me have the Felstriker&quot; (knowing I need those two items) Well the Felstriker drops... but not the Dal'Rend's Tribal Guardian. The whole group, at once, is marveled at the drop. As soon as it popped up from the screen my cousin, the Mage, yells, &quot;ONLY ROGUES ROLL! DON'T BE STUPID! ONLY ROGUES ROLL!&quot; Since there were only two Rogues, my cousin and myself, we roll and I roll an 87 while he gets a 52... I win :D Later on... the Shadowcraft Tunic didn't drop</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my opinion, it's fairly useless to someone who is not dual wielding.<br /><br />Look at it's speed. You could only get one proc off if you're not dual wielding. This is ideal for Rogues, Fury Warriors, and yeah I'll let it slide, Hunters. Anyone else who is using this is wasting a good proc. Rogues get instant attacks so as soon as it procs, spam SS. It's good for Warriors and Hunters specifically for white dmg. I'd be pretty pissed if a Mage or a Warlock rolled on this seeing as they don't do much upfront dmg.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Heres some useful info on it: It procs around just as much if not a little more than Crusader, when it procs it makes BOTH of your daggers crit and hit as well as any instant attacks crit and hit, enemies still have a chance to dodge parry or block as normal but you will never &quot;miss&quot;, the most I have seen it crit was 8 times with slice and dice+bladeflurry+warcheifs. I use it off hand with Fang of the Faceless in my main and the proc still happens ALOT. When it goes off it makes a noise and effect similar to sprint.

Just imagine using Whirlwind, Bloodthirst etc. when this procs. It's like &quot;mini&quot;-Recklessness.<br />And just like Strongsword said &quot;if you need, you roll.

I say that earlier I had declared Felstriker to be a Rogue only roll and gave it to the other Rogue. This guy starts rambling about how sick a WF weapon it is and he would have been able to own in PvP and blah blah blah... did I do the right thing, declaring it to be Rogue only?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Blizzard posters have said that weapons with &quot;On Hit&quot; chances like this one don't proc on a certain percentage of hits, since that would mean that fast-hitting weapons (like this one) would proc a lot more than slow-hitting 2-hand weapons. So basically, these things proc according to time intervals. They don't go off on a regular timetable or anything, but it just means that weapon speed is in no way related to proc frequency.<br /><br />BTW, When you use this, not only do your regular hits crit for 3 seconds, but your specials do as well. Might be nice to get 3 crit sinister strikes in a row along, eh? :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>51 hunter here, not sure why hunters would want to roll on this - even with a fast bow/gun firing off a round every 1.3 seconds, and with rapid fire cutting that down to around 0.78 seconds, you're not going to get off more than 3-4 shots in the time it takes you to run out of melee range so you can start shooting that bow/gun. totally not worth the effort in PvE, worth it in PvP if you're already getting away. guess it works if you've got a group of enemies, some close and some far.<br /><br />i'm very skeptical of the claim below that it procs on ranged attacks as well, nothing else behaves like that.<br /><br />dual dawn's edges, or rin'ji's, or a polearm, or a barbarous blade, would be much nicer for a hunter, imho. i'd rather pass on this so that the damn rogues don't roll of my bows when they drop.</div>

Both can make excellent use of it, if I was leading a raid I'd say at the start, &quot;Warriors can't roll on Dalrend's, but Felstriker is fair game.&quot;- that way rogues have a far larger chance of not getting screwed, in their opinions.

It was great cause not only this fell but the Blackblade off Drakksith fell as well that I also won. Im fury spec though so i perfer using this dagger. I use it in offhand with +15 str on it for AP and I have Eskhanders Right Claw for my main hand. Alot of ppl think im dumb for taking these weapons for fury spec but I love them. With my Hand of Justice which procs like mad. As soon as i get 1 Crit I get a Cascading Crit pwn session made from my Flurry self buff and when Eskhanders procs which it also does ALL the time i have a 60% faster attack speed. Crusader Procs like mad with this speed crits go off the wall with fel at this speed i cant spam Bloodthirst fast enough to burn my rage skills so i burn WW at the same time and it often procs more HoJ procs which make more procs and so on so on. And depending if im pvping or pveing i have Heroism for pve or Maelstrom for pvp which helps with the missing dps. Also since this stuff crits like a raging psming woman on steriods. I just been buffing my gear with +% chance to hit and +str and stamina gear. I dont need much agi for the crits but i take it anyways for armor bonuses and dodge/parry. I wish there was a higher damage verison of these but even if not im the fastest attacking person who always has full rage and i hardly ever miss. I LOVE THESE 2 WEAPONS!<br /><br />PS just for pvp ive been tempted to get Invunerable mail made just to piss of rogues even MORE. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Really curious about the proc rate. An item stands and falls with it. At a 1.7 Speed, you might expect it to proc 2-3 times per minute (6-9 sec). During this time: No misses, glances, parries, blocks, evades whatsoever. A Fury Warrior should never part with it (if he doesn't have Thunderfury of course).<br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 29th 2006 at 4:12am PST by nmeye</i></div>

I have to assume any hit is fine since Skullforge Reaver is Chance on hit and its life steal procts when I fire my arrows. So would this work on this daggers proc? I think I would like to get this dagger for my hunter but not over a rogue. If this did work for my arrows then I would suggest ALL classes get this weapon its just insane to have crits like that.</div>

Everyone was shocked that it dropped. the other rogue spammed the raid chat.My heart was going &quot;bam bam bam bam&quot;, Greatly unfortunely for me i rolled 5 and the other rouge 75!. I was speechless when I lost it. The other rouge already had assaination blade and scarlet kris. I stared at the screen for 10mins whilst the other rouge was Super happy. Im like the unluckiest rouge ever. So unfair..... wish i could turn back time and roll 100.<br />60 Rougue on eu-lightnings blade <br /><br />Edited, Thu May 11 17:30:43 2006</div>

Oh and I won the second one last night. It is not a &quot;rogue or warrior specific weapon.&quot; Otherwise, why can hunters use daggers?<br /><br />Obviously we can use daggers because we get into high mob areas and while our pet is attacking one - we get another attacking us. So obviously we need a melee weapon too.<br /><br />I love my daggers and I don't care what people say - hunters need melee also :)<br /><br />BB<br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 31st 2006 at 8:25pm EDT by Wildwitch</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This dagger was held in reverence when UBRS was the hardest instance people did. Still a great weapon to play around with even to this day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been using this dagger for a long time. It was such a great weapon. I even kept my Gutgore Ripper (From MC) in my backpack and used the Felstriker instead.<br />Unfortunately, the Felstriker has been nerfed, and nerfed hard. <br />It used to proc just about every fight (More than once sometimes, if it was a longer fight.). But last night while running scholo (My friend needed help gearing back up after he got his character back naked from blizz) it only procced 4 times during the ENTIRE instance.<br />Either I was really unlucky last night, or it's been nerfed. And if the proc rate is really that low, dont bother running UBRS a ridiculous amount of times for this :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm assuming that &quot;on hit&quot; means when you're character is hit.<br /><br />But I very likely could be wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I feel that someone has to point this out:<br /><br />You hit someone, and for the next 3 seconds all your hits are criticals. The thing is... the weapon attacks a a speed of 1.7, which (if I'm not very much mistaken) means 1 attack every 1.7 seconds.<br /><br />So when you get the critical bonus thing, you actually only get one hit with critical on it, then you get another normal one, then theoretically another critical and so on. So you would alternate crits and noncrits. If you hit the enemy you get a guaranteed critical hit next shot, then (on the basis that you can't stack the effect on iteself) you have to wait for the 3 seconds to end before it reapplies, meaning that you cannot turn the effect on by hitting them with the critical attack. Hence, every 2nd attack is critical. Why didn't they just do that? so much simpler.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Every warrior, priest or mage rolling for this should be tied up, thrown down a waterfall, pulled out with a chainsawchain (spinning of course), shot 300 feet wide by a catapult and caught by ONE electric rope by snapping round his neck.<br /><br />And then his corpse should be raised again as undead and then tortured the rest of his existence. <br /><br />Tanks: Don't need it, they have swords and axes with much much MUCH more damage, dammit. <br />Priests: Give them everything but a dagger without int-stats.<br />Mage: Same as priests.<br /><br />We are rogues, without our criticals we are nothing, y'know?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon is the *the* optimal fury warrior offhand. End of arguement. A fury warrior will never replace this with MC/ZG/BWL weapons ever (unless they introduce something comparable in the future). <br /><br />Yea, priest and mages and even hunters...screw off. Its useless for you.<br /><br />Haha, it's so funny when people post and dont even know how class mechanics work. Example:<br /><br />&quot;Tanks: Don't need it, they have swords and axes with much much MUCH more damage, dammit.&quot; -Do you even realize how aggro works? Yes I wouldnt roll on this purely for tanking, but its an insane tanking weapon. If you cant see that, you shouldnt be talking at all.<br /><br />For the arguement that it's a dagger and warriors shouldnt use daggers. Why not? Honestly whats the difference? None, is the correct answer. Might be a different story if we got a penalty for using them or something, but thats not the case. Would you feel better if it was exactly the same but said &quot;sword&quot;. Oh then magically it would be viable for a warrior to use...of course.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this on my 83th UBRS run, My guildleader needed some people for a BWL-attunement and he asked me but i didn't want to go, then he just invited me and i joined -but i was not really happy- so we went on and then the little thing dropped. lol,,, i would so have killed myself if i wouldn't have been there when it dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This bad boy would never leave a Fury Warrior's offhand. Id personally prefer it over corehound, brutality blade, etc... PvP is all about surprise damage and this thing does just that. It procing means white crits + bloodthirst/whirlwind. That is even more damage then what a rogue can do in 3 secs! Yes I said it... MORE THEN A ROGUE. A rogue could get in a 5pt evis or a backstab but how many rogues do u know save energy. A good warrior should have good rage management since that is the clear difference between a good warrior and a craptastic warrior. This in the offhand and Deathbringer in the MH is the highest ever recorded DPS in game. Like I said a warrior would never replace it and rogues can easily obtain a better/equal offhand. Now with BG and patches soo many eaisly obtainable daggers with higher max damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this is one of the weopons given to rogues on the 1.10 patch test, also get the lobitimizer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this on 11th or 12th shot at Rend. Drop rate must've been upped in the patch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just got one, mainly to play around with for now. I have a Vis'Kag mainhand and Warblade of the Hakkari offhand so it's really a cross-grade, but I am considering respec'ing to daggers once I get my hands on a decent main-hand dagger (I'm thinking Dragonfang), so I went for it. I was rolling against one other, a fury warrior. I won't go into which class makes better use of it, because that isn't the point of my post.<br /><br />I did extensive testing with it right after it dropped, and the proc rate absolutely blows. After getting it from Rend, I saw it proc a grand total of 3 more times in UBRS, all the way through Drakkisath. I remember a time when this dagger was pretty decent, but I think they may have actually nerfed it in 1.10 when they increased the drop rate. It may have to do with my spec, the fact that when I was testing it neither of my weapons were enchanted or loaded with poisons, or something else. But really, I'd say CHT makes a better offhand for dagger rogues.<br /><br />I'm quite disappointed that the proc rate was nerfed so much, as when I won it I was anticipating a truly godly offhand. Oh well, I have access to much better weapons so it isn't a huge deal.. This is really sort of a novelty dagger now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got this a week ago on my second real UBRS run.<br /><br />the other rogue in the raid already had is, so it defaulted to me. only later did i hear how rare it is.<br /><br />and the proc is amazing. it's all timing, but this thing rules for both pve and pvp.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Jun 6 03:41:14 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A fury warrior benifits from this weapon just the same as a rogue does... but more.<br /><br />We can cast our burst attacks... Bloodthirst, whirlwind and do nice damage... yet at the same time this proc will start a flurry and put us at 30% haste as well as give us lots of rage to play with.<br /><br />and some noob out there said that warriors need a slow weapon not a fast one? Does your 60 warrior have an offhand? Because if he does then you should try putting a fast weapon in it and see how much it helps your rage generation. Faster weapons get dodged more often, giving you the ability to overpower your target... yeaaaahhhh I don't think you have a warrior at all.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 11th 2006 at 8:54pm PDT by gdspam</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The thing WOULD be nice for hunters if it worked for Ranged weapons too, yes.<br />Most points have been said already, but keep in mind, all shots the hunter fires (even special) can get critical, depending on Crit chance. That would mean a hunter can get like 6 shots of in 3 secs, wich would make it a good hunter weapon.<br />Anyway, i dont think it works on range, wich should make us hunters not even look at it...<br />(if it works on range, count me in on rolling over one of these)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just watched a video where a rogue ninjad all of garr's loot in MC, it turns out it was basically revenged because he was the only rogue when this dropped and a hunter ended up rolling against him and winning it... The rogue even ended up deleting some1 else's lvl 60 pally... Lol<br /><br />I read that a druid won it... that is really ludacris, druids are gonna either be in feral, playing healbot, or nuking, any druid who would attack enough for this to proc on a consistent basis sucks<br /><br />Even if the weapon's proc did work for range, some1 already pointed out it would be a miracle to realize it proced, then quickly run into range of his bow/gun then be able to fire<br /><br />I do think that a shaman could definately use this considering it is a dagger, shamans love daggers, and use melee very often. A warrior, meh, i wouldnt blame him, but a warrior using a dagger just doesnt seem cool lol<br /><br />Overall i think a rogue deserves this the most, but if i was a rogue and got ourolled by a shammie i would be mad but not really at the shammie, and if a warrior won it i would be slightly ticked, but if a hunter won it... wow, i wouldnt go to the degree that rogue did but would sure make me mad</div>
