However, the Island that has dropped the kelp for me every time, and after only killing 2 or 3 oracles, is the Southernmost Murloc Island.<br />Simply kill all the Oracles on the island, get the kelp, clear the altar, place kelp on altar, kill the guy, and poof... done...well, that is, if you have run to the other 2 damn corners of the world...yeah... long quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey all people who have difficult to do this q.. i mean have done it long time, i had killed 70 oracles at the island with the ALTAR then i went a little to the east to anotehr island.. with oracles too on my second oracle i got the kelp... try to go other islands then the one with the Altar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dagun is a big mother... but he aint hard til kill.. i had no problems killing him.. pala 44.. and he didn't reach any adds :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What you have to do is to kill the ones near the altar and them catch a herb<br />and summon the elite using the herb in the altar. <br />He i'll drop the Hand of Dagun</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I experienced many of the difficulties others have noted above in regards to getting the kelp necessary to summon Dagun the Ravernous at the altar. In one session i returned to the islands on three different occassions and wiped them all clean of Oracles and everything else multiple times but the kelp wouldn't drop (on the bright side got about 2-3g worth of silver and drops to sell on AH). <br /><br />Logged back in the next day and before I joined any groups for any reason or did any instances etc I went straight to Dustwallow Marsh and got it on the 2nd kill on the southern most island (though I agree that the Oracle that drops the kelp is probably random).<br /><br /><b> So, if your having no luck getting the kelp, my advice would be to move on and return to complete it as your first objective the next time you log back into the game. </b><br /><br />BTW, once you clear the area around the altar right click on the seweed not the altar to summon Dagun. If you are worried about adds make sure you clear the area and don't loot them till after you kill Dagun. And since he runs away near the end if you meet him at the shoreline, instead of letting him come to you in the camp, when he runs away it will be in an area of the shoreline without adds.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what is the kelp called</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The drop really does suck!&nbsp; Took me over an hour to get the item!&nbsp; So if you really want to complete this quest, plan on spending some time getting the kelp!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is called enchanted sea kelp, it comes from the oracles and when you get to the altar, you click on the kelp in your bag, not the altar, to summon the giant</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We had cleared the camp close to where you summon too at least 3 or 4 times and then went to the South Island and it dropped almost immediately. Not sure if that always happens but was happy it finally did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I cleared out the Island with the altar - twice, saw the notes about the kelp drop on the Southern most island. Cleared that out - still no kelp drop.&nbsp; Lvl 46 Hunter so I started methodicaly going to each island with Oracles and cleared them out.&nbsp; On the 3rd trip to the island with the altar - the Oracle that droped the kelp was at <b>58,11</b>.&nbsp; Dagun comes up from the East side of the island and was a easy kill - and yes he does run before he dies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>took about ten seconds on the upper left island where the altar is.<br /><br />lvl 51 warr, killed about 8 oracles.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is my first ever post...normally it takes me 100 kills to get drops in quests like this..but for the first time ever, I got the drop on my first kill :) Went straight to southernmost island, killed one oracle got the kelp, then looted a chest next to him for junk. took about 30 seconds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so here's my compilation of information<br /><br />Southernmost island is where the kelp dropped for me, and according to most posters thats the highest drop rate (64,27)<br /><br />Named npc while you're grinding oracles, dropped a green for me on one of the islands - (62,18)<br /><br />Altar - (58,9)<br /><br />the summoned mob is a 43 elite. clear the murloc camp, don't loot the corpses so they take longer to respawn. click on kelp to place it on the altar. The npc will come from the east side of the island from the water. Avoid adds - kite him to the water and fight there. He hits slow so you have time to heal yourself. He runs away at low health, be sure to be away from camps of mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Get the quest &quot;The Star, the Hand and the Heart&quot; from the Undercity.<br /><br />To get the Hand of Dagun you need to kill the Mirefin Oracles:<br /><br />@ <b>58,10</b><br /><br />The drop rate is a somewhat low as you can see, but its not all bad. It took me about an hour from which I cleared the island at <b>58,10</b> several times with no luck so I explored the islands south of there<br /><br />@ <b>62,18</b> and <b>64,28</b><br /><br />Still I didn't have any luck so I went back to <b>58,10</b> and then the kelp finally dropped off one of the Mirefin Oracles next to the Altar.<br /><br />They left the details out of the quest, but you need the kelp to summon Dagun the Ravenous. Once you get the kelp you place it on the altar located @ <b>58,10</b> and then he comes out of the water, try to clear some of the adds around the island before you summon him so you dont have a load of Mirefin's on you while your trying to down him.<br /><br /><b>Screenshot</b>:<br /><br /><a href="http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/1463/dagunaj3.png" rel="nofollow">http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/1463/dagunaj3.png</a><br /><br />-<b>Pierre</b> Level 46 Priest - &lt;Folie � Deux&gt;<br />The Forgotten Coast &lt;PvP&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I killed every murloc on the island with the altar and got my kelp that way.&nbsp; While Dagun does run when he is low health, he emerges out of the sea, and you can meet him next to the water, so respawns shouldn't be an issue.&nbsp; A tip for Gnomes, he is so tall that if you want to see his face fight him from on top of one of the hillocks on the island.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zig2</b></h3>45minutes everywhere nothing<br />4 mobs on southern island and drops</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RhaegarTargaryen</b></h3>Wanted to add that the Kelp just dropped for me off my first Oracle kill near the altar.<br /><br />Might have been lucky, might be the drop rate has changed from what it was previously reported as.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>d3w4yn3</b></h3>Well, well, well. So, if you stick to the main island, the drop rate is insanely low. The lowest I've seen anywhere in classic to date. I killed over 200 murlocs on the island, and no drop. I harvested 115 shiny fish scales and thick murloc scales without running into the kelp. I'll experiment on other islands, but if you stick to the main island, my advice is to abandon the quest and find your rewards elsewhere.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>knewal</b></h3>After killing mobs for 5 bars at lvl 42 the item finally dropped, cleared the area around altar although it wasn't necessary, used the item and the dude came out of the water on the east side. A lvl 43 elite water giant with 5148 hp, no special ability just tank and spank, soloed as rogue, at 5% hp it runs away.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Suggestions</b></h3>You need to get an <a href="/classic/item=4639/enchanted-sea-kelp">Enchanted Sea Kelp</a> and use it at the Seaworn Altar (59.4, 9.6 Dustwallow Marsh) to summon <a href="/classic/npc=2937/dagun-the-ravenous">Dagun the Ravenous</a>.<br /><br /><a href="/classic/item=4639/enchanted-sea-kelp">Enchanted Sea Kelp</a> has about a 7% drop rate from <a href="/classic/npc=4363/mirefin-oracle">Mirefin Oracle</a> in the area - and on other nearby islands.</div>
