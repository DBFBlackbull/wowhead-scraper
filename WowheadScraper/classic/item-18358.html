The only way people to the sides could get breathed on is if tank is poorly positioned and gets knocked to side, or if rogue\/hunter\/mage has hit with to much DPS and pulled agro off MT. Phase 2, fire balls, nah not going to be issue. Phase 3 and lava spews, nah not an issue unless you decide standing on the cracks is a good place to fight from.","date":"2006-04-01T16:54:35-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"... did you beat Onyxia?","creationdate":"2006-04-01T16:54:35-06:00","id":1169826,"rating":7,"commentid":2695240,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Vandana","importedSubject":"Yes but ..."},{"body":"Are you an idiot?

This book can be bought off the Auction House and solo turned in at Dire Maul's Library. Once you have the book, head to Dire Maul North. You must have either the DM key, be a Blacksmith carrying a Truesilver key or bring along a rogue to open the door into DM north. Once zoned in wait for the ogre next to the ramp to walk away. head down ramp and jump onto left rail and hug that left wall to the library door, again you will need the key to get in. Once you get through that door head along the empty cooridor until you reach the library and turn in for this sweet trinket. It provides mages with +10 Fire Resistance and +8 mana/5 Sec. Great for mana regen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Darksbane</b></h3>I agree with the above poster that this is book rewards a pretty good trinket for mages. However, it is only good for fire-based instances, and not much else. The +8 mana per 5 seconds isn't that great for a mage (Mage Armor makes this bonus pretty much useless (allows 30% of your mana regeneration to continue while casting), and I personally would rather have some spell damage or crit rating), but the +10 fire resistance is great.<br /><br />Price wise, this book isn't worth very much. It IS a rare drop, but the trinket just isn't worth the 50-100 gold most people ask for. If you see this book for about 5-10 gold, I recommend that you pick it up. You can also attempt to farm for this item in Dire Maul.<br /><br />Happy hunting,<br />Darksbane</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's amazing to see the amount of nonsense in this post.&nbsp; Sure, +10 fire resistance may not be that great on its own, but when stacked with 5+ other pieces of fire resist gear, it adds up.&nbsp; If and when you ever run MC, you are going to want every piece of FR gear you can get.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as the regen tick, there are plenty of mages out there who go for mana regen gear.&nbsp; This is an excellent addition to that gear.<br /><br />So while you're running MC with your &quot;Insignia of the Horde&quot; trinket equipped, I'll run MC with this on.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can easily get up to 60 / 80 mana regen per 5 second, just think of it, that means ~840 mana every minute, Very Very Very good for priest, mage vs MC bosses and World bosses</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; Im sick &amp; tired of reading how much this trinket rocks/sucks . <br /><br />&nbsp; Where the hell do i go to turn in&nbsp; this quest ?&nbsp; Theres no map or NPC exact location , just some place Fleetwood . <br /><br />&nbsp; I need help here ...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If I remember correctly you have to goto the Library in Dire Maul North. You will need to obtain the Crescent Key if you don't already have it because DM North is locked. Once you get in head to the left and down the ramp. There will be a camp there filled with Ogres around a camp fire. You can get past them if you hug the south wall...go down the ramp that is by them. Here is just a REALLY long hallway that leads to the library and the same location of the Crystal Water quest. Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest can be done at 54 with the assistance from a person with the cresent key. I just baught the book on Spinebreaker and did it with a friend. You really dont need more then a Lesser Invisibility potion (But you can use a Invisibility potion if you would like to be safer). Since its such a short distance from the start of the instance past the first mob you only need one potion. <br /><br />The thing you need to look out for is the Dog Patrol, they spot you very easy because of there high stealth detection, I had to die once to learn to watch closer. <br /><br />When you go down the ramp to the left at the very beginning of the instance, try not to get to close to the mob at the bottom, jump off the side to get a little distance and then hug the corner of the next ramp down to the library door. Once you get into the library door you're in the clear. Enjoy you new Trinket when you finish that long run down the hall!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I read in the 1.10 patch that the book quest in DM will not be repeatable anymore. Does that mean that you can buy like 2 books and then leave the same book twice to get 2 trinklets?<br /><br />Anyone know?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bought this for 8g. Newbie ftw ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got to ask why so many mention Onyxia when talking about this trinket, or any other FR gear? You don't need any FR gear at Onyxia.<br />I have done MC/Onyxia with my warrior (MT), my priest and my mage, and I don't wear FR gear with ANY of them at Onyxia even as MT, as you just plain don't need it. Your best gear is fine and only isn't if you suck at doing Onyxia to be honest. The only way people to the sides could get breathed on is if tank is poorly positioned and gets knocked to side, or if rogue/hunter/mage has hit with to much DPS and pulled agro off MT. Phase 2, fire balls, nah not going to be issue. Phase 3 and lava spews, nah not an issue unless you decide standing on the cracks is a good place to fight from.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Arcanist is the anagram of anarchist, and is a well knwon fact that there is an &quot;Anarchist's Cookbook&quot; that is a MUST for all insurgents.<br /><br />Nice joke ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Cmon this is the mage version of the item and the fact is, mages dont really need FR for molton core.<br />My own fire resist is only 27+ mage armor 30 or what ever, i just ran MC this weekend and only died 3 times, one of those beinging a wipe another being the &quot;bomb&quot; (forgot my ice block spell) and the other on rag. admitedly if id had fire resist i may not have died on rag. but god people your mages just stay out pof range of mob spells nothing in MC has range as high as us(excluding rag)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MJSquash</b></h3>Since a lot of the old comments here are completely wrong, I would like to add that this trinket is useless for mages. <br />They need +dmg spellpower</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ataegina</b></h3>This is the worst book-reward-trinket in the game bar none.<br /><br />It has precisely ONE potential use - &quot;stacking up&quot; a tiny (and largely irrelevant) amount of fire res with other cheap pieces (torch of austen etc) for a very very niche scenario - namely, boosting SM armory. With blizzard (unable to crit) being your main damage spell there and with the shatter combo giving you a +50% chance to crit, you could potentially use this instead of eye of the beast while boosting SM armory in p2, as Eye of the Beast would not be particularly useful there (of course, better options do exist).<br /><br />Other than that, it's utter crap and it will never be used in any normal scenario. Turning this in to DM North Library is simply put...not worth your time, not even if you're already in DM East.<br /><br />You can safely ignore any comment that states otherwise. <br /><br />Every other class trinket has something somewhat useful for at least one spec (rogues get 2% hit, shamans/warlocks get spell damage, hunters get ranged AP, warriors get a tiny bit of armor, druids and priests get +healing).<br /><br />Mages get...8 mp5. Yes, a class with mage armor, clearcasting and arcane meditation (maybe), a class that can use a 1000-1200 mana ruby...the devs at the time apparently thought mages wouldn't appreciate hit, crit or spell damage, so they gave them a 8 mp5 - a whopping 96 mana every minute. That means that if you're in a slow/low dps group - we're talking &quot;I just started playing wow in 2025&quot; - this trinket could potentially regenerate enough mana to allow you to cast ONE (1) extra frostbolt on...probably Ragnaros, because no other fight lasts long enough, even in a clueless raid.<br /><br />I cleared classic content in 2004-2005, then in 2019-2020 and this might be third time. I have never had to use any fire res gear for any encounter. Not on trash, not on bosses. Not even when solo-ing things. It looks like...they simply forgot to add stats to the mage trinket and they're now too embarrassed to fix that, as it would imply failing to fix a problem for 20+ years.<br /><br />If someone gives you this book for free, report them for griefing.</div>
