As an alchemist I killed a couple of them weeks ago. The recipe didn't drop. Yesterday I just killed one for fun and it dropped. :) Now I can make all Greater Protection Potions. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Edit: I've spent all day killing Frostmaul Giant(about 50) and also killing Frostmaul Preserver(20-30) to make sure that the Gaints spawn.<br /><br />I killed all the one's in the huge ditch area and the one's over and around the bridge ten times over. During witch time i collected FOUR black lotus, 30xSliversage 40xIcecap but still no recipe am I just plain unlucky?<br /><br />Time spent killing 7am-12pm. 2pm-6pm. 12am - 3am.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got it after 2 days of grinding.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of 19. october I collected one, after doing the &quot;collect frost maul shards&quot; quest. Think we killed about 20 level 59s and 60s, and the recipe dropped. I won the roll. One at a time they can be killed by 57 shaman, 57 mage and 58 warrior fairly easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got this while doing quest, cant be anymore luckier than that :D<br /><br />i dont even know they drop it be4 i go there lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dropped off 3 mobs on ED (Euro) server, I guess I can use one and sell one. Probably a fluke, but anyone with knowledge of %ages can tell you that just because it's rare (or not) doesn't mean it can't drop often.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My mage is full Netherwind and these elite giants are hard to solo since they are immune to frost (and frost nova).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Confirmed that these still drop as of 4 May 2006. <br /><br />These mobs are elite in the same manner as High Chief Winterfall; that is, they hit about four times as hard as, and have about four times the HP of, a normal mob.&nbsp; So, yes, easy to solo with most classes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got this one in about 2 hours. Handy, cos i didnt want to pay 150-300g for it. Being a pally, these guys are just another sustainability fight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>even it says 4% i was grinding giants and preservers for about 3 hours with a mage and a paladin (im a priest) we were killing about one giant per 20 seconds but no drop for us. We got some greenies, some greys but no recipe.<br /><br />I will try again tomorrow.<br /><br />R u sure they still drop from these giants?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>did frostmaul quest and got the recipe by accident, lucky me :o</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took me about 5 hours of farming (split over two days) to get this recipie.&nbsp; I had just ran out of food and was going to leave, and on the last one before I left it droped.(6-1-06)<br /><br />Takes a long time to get this recipie and the mobs don't drop many grays/greens.&nbsp; I could have probably farmed the money to just buy this off of the AH in the time it took me to actually get the recipie.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>does the giant zepper from the goblin in ferals work on these guys?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a druid and farmed it with a hunter (for quest). We were pretty lucky to find the recipe from the 2nd mob :) Anyway - big dps plus healing makes them very easy to kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was grinding something like 20 of them in 3 men group. It was easz but did not drop. When group disbanded i tried to kill some. First one - DROPPED! :-D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was doing the shards quest. as a level 60 warlock with dark pact I can easily solo 2. Dropped to my suprise sold real nice at the AH</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Not hard at all as shadow priest. As holy they are a little bit harder but still soloable. Just takes some time to kill em and the droprate is low.. Have a mage make you water before going here, you burn most of you mana on a single mob as holy.. GL all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did the shard quest with a lvl 60 guildmate.<br />When we both had enough shards we got our mount and ran away... but i aggroed one gaint by mistake and got dazed -.- but ok, we killed that last gaint and it dropped! I won the roll with 89 :) and sold it on AH for 120g ! so i'm very happy!<br /><br />lvl 60 hunter - Silvermoon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got 2 of these in under 10 minutes (pure luck) from the Frostmaul Giants. Very easy to solo as a Lock, just keep them feared and make sure they don't agro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tried the giant zapper you get from the Feralas quest you just get &quot;invalid target&quot; so aparently its only good in Feralas&nbsp; as you might infer from its name</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Went to farm these giants hoping for this recipe for Twin Emps.&nbsp; It dropped 10 minutes after I started killing them.&nbsp; These guys are cake for a Shaman with earth shield.&nbsp; I am able to finish fights with 70%+ health and 75%+ mana easily.&nbsp; Pulling adds isn't even a huge concern because taking two at a time isn't very difficult, either.&nbsp; I think I've found a new home for a while.&nbsp; Decent loot tables and a good amount of money for each kill.&nbsp; Even the trash is good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On my lvl 55 hunter, just for fun I kited Giants into Everlook using Serpent Sting 1 so he would have alot of health once he got there. He'd have 60-80% health left and got a chuckle at everyone surprised there's a giant in town. (The Bruiser net him and take him down pretty fast)<br /><br />Got the recipe off my 5th-6th kill WOOT! She's an alchemist and that was the last one I needed. Something my frost mage couldn't have ever pulled off. (Minor Speed Enchant and Fireblast Blink kiting? Wand Blink kiting?)<br /><br />Ran out of Giants on top so went down to the valley, had my pet attack the first one, then next one, etc until I got a giant, which then I put pet on passive and started the stinging.<br /><br />This all started when I was a little peeved during the Shard quest Frostmauls killed me a couple of times... sweet revenge!<br /><br />Quick kill: Turn Growl off and have him nipping at his ankles, use highest Serpent, Conc Shot + normal shots.
