<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went up the stairs opened the chest and got the journal and touch of zanzil but i cant get the key it wont let me loot anybody is it because i have the touch of zanzil</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you have the ability to distract, just distract him then pickpocket.&nbsp; He might aggro u but u should get the pickpocket off.&nbsp; I just did it like a second ago so it works (22 NE)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>thanks for 100000 people saying how they failed to pick pocket him now can some1 tell me where exactly he is</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With a level 21 gnome, 1 talent spent in Master od Deception and 100 lockpicking skill.<br /><br />I pickpocketed him first time, got the key, hit the sprint button and got away without aggro-ing him.<br /><br />After that, got upstairs, kill the first 2 guards and avoided the other 2, sap klaven, open the chest, got the book and ... (this is my favorite part) hit hearthstone to get teleported away from this nasty place. Be careful with this: if you are not fast enoguh, klaven will get you while casting HS and you will be teleported to the graveyard instead XD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>done it in 2 minutes and 47 seconds.<br /><br />Instructions: Take the quest, go stealth and fidn the malformed drone; After that, pick pocket him 8 he wil lnot see u if u didnt get the book yet)get the key and go o nthe tower. U wil lfidn an eltie there, sap him and open the chest.<br />U can do also with the other way but if u follow my instructions it will e easy</div>
