<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The best place for level 36-42 is dustwallow on the beach, it will take you a while to get a lot, but you will get mad xp if you stick with it, right now I am 49 and hitting the Hinterlands turltes on the far east beach, I can get 60 scales in under 2 hours, which I can sell at the AH for a lot of gold, not to mention the turtles drop clam's that have pearls in them, and the speckled shell fragments sell for 45s per stack of 5, so basically, you can make about 20 gold selling all of the stuff you get from the turtles at the AH if the market is right at the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Started farming these last night at (level 38) with the Mudrock Burrowers at Duskwallow.&nbsp; Killed 13 of them (Around level 39/40) and got no scales from skinning so I gave up and went for the tortoises / spikeshells on the east beach.<br /><br />Stats for them are as follows:<br /><br />Time farmed - 6hrs :(<br />Mudrock Tortoises - 84 killed, 19 scales (23%)<br />Mudrock Spikeshell - 96 killed, 21 scales (22%)<br /><br />Green Items: 6<br />Blue Items: 1<br />12 gold made from vendor trash dropped.<br /><br />Next time I'm farming whelplings or humanoids.&nbsp; Much better drops and easier to kill.&nbsp; Could have bought 20 scales for 2g anyway.&nbsp; Of course, now I want to complete the quest I can't get the pattern for sale. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the ones in hinterlands drop about 1-2 per skin PLUS 1 or 2 thick/rugged leather. well worth it =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Saltwater Snapjaws on the eastern coast of the Hinterlands proves to be the best place for me.&nbsp; I skin an average of 2 scales per kill about 91% of the time.&nbsp; Rugged and Thick leather drop as well and the vendor trash is annoying but not bad in price when sold.&nbsp; Just be sure to empty your packs because the speckled shell fragmenst only stack to 5.<br /><br />There's also a 49 elite turtle that's in the same spot and you can usually skin 4 scales from him.&nbsp; He's easy enough to solo for me, but I'm a 60 hunter.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why is it that i am only lv 36, with 210 lw and 225 skin and to get mats to make a req lev 37 armour peice you need to farm lv 42's+ for a good drop rate! Maddness......</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got about 150 of these in less than 2 hours of grinding (Acctually, I was trying to get golden pearls with no luck.) Also, 170 thick leather and about 50 rugged leather, of the turtles in Hinterlands. I'm level 50 priest btw.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am farming for turtles scales on the beach in dustwallow at coor. 60,20 to 64,40.&nbsp; I was getting a drop rate of about 20% to 25%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These scales are very easy to get if you farm the lvl 37-38 but you have to skin them, they actually come quite frequently.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found probably 1 out of 5 kills along the beatch in Dustwallow March, However beeing lvl 41 the turtles there are mostly green, so I'm going to try Tanaris to see if the drop rate is better there, However I dont think turtle scales are a rare drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're high enough go to the east coast of the Hinterlands.&nbsp; There are 49 and 50 level snapjaws with an 80%+ rate there....if you're a skinner.&nbsp; They don't drop, they have to be skinned.&nbsp; Thick leather drops with each one skinned.&nbsp; Sometimes you even get two scales.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>At level 40 Hunter Blood Elf, went to try Dustwallow and was getting about 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 drop. Went to Tanaris, East Coast, next to the docks at Steamwheedle Port. They were level 43 and easy to kill at my level 40. Map coordinates (67,20):<br />Steeljaw Snappers Killed:21<br />Turtle Scales: 13 (62%)<br />Heavy Leather: 9<br />Thick Leather: 10<br />Heavy Hide: 1<br />Thick Hide: 2<br /><br />Tried South a little ways, past the next set of rocks at (67,35):<br />Steeljaw Snappers killed:20<br />Turtle Scales: 12 (60%)<br />Heavy Leather: 8<br />Thick Leather: 9<br />Heavy Hide: 1<br />Thick Hide: 2<br /><br />If you go further south past the pirate cove, you run into level 49 Surf Gliders (turtles) , which were too hard to kill at my level.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So, the easiest place to get Turtle Scale seems to be from the ones in Dustwallow Marsh, from the beach. However, I spend one hour skinning those turtles non-stop and got only one scale from it.<br /><br />It can only be got with skinning, so I guess it will take a while before you get 40 of these scales for the Leatherworking quest.<br /><br />:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A great place to farm these scales is the coastline of Tanaris where you do the Cuergo's Gold quest. Hardly anybody ever there and there are TONS of the turtles there, and on land, too. Location around 54, 92.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the scales skin off the turtles on the coast in The Hinterlands pretty fast, and most times i got multiple scales from them! i got three scales off of Gammerita three times!<br /><br />for an hour's work (with my lvl 60 Paladin ;^) i got 35 scales. not too bad.<br /><br />later,<br />Rock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found that the best place is in Tanaris, as well. You get about 1 scale per 3-5 turtles. DWM only gave about 1 scale every 15-20 tutles. What I did notice however, is that when a Turtle drops Turtle Meat, there will always be a scale. Also, If you are trying to make the Wild armor set, you will need 21 Wildvine total. Wildvine can be farmed from the Trolls in STV.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Though I have personally heard very good things about the turtle scale droprate off the Hinterlands turtles (as well as other nice items), for Alliance on PVP servers, you should stay away after the 1.5 patch. 1.5 added a Horde town to the south end of the shore, and they are very happy to protect it from any &quot;invading&quot; Alliance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would go by the total number of scales found off the mobs and say that Saltwater Snapjaw in Hinterlands are the best way to get Turtle Scales. (4x more total than anywhere else) They spawn all over the eastern coast of Hinterlands so they're easy to find, and the skin rate of scales is higher, even if it is still not great. The only drawback is that they are pretty high level. (but the !@#$ty drop rate on the others is reason enough to wait to do this quest)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Though it seems as if the turtles in te Hinterlands would be your best bet, on my server most people don't loot or skin when they do the qst for the fishing rod. It's disgusting to see over 50 turtle corpses littering the area at once and it seems as though i have much better luck on wavestrider beach in Tanaris. Have a shaman (like me) give you underwater breathing. also note that the speckled shell fragments sell for a little over 45s a 5 stack. might not mean much to you, but every little bit helps. It's always a nice gesture as well to take LWs out turtle hunting for their wild leather qsts as they need (i believe) 168 scales to complete the qsts plus wildvine and leather and thread. I like to hun turtles often as you can generally find a zone that gives good xp for kils and i present all of my guildie shammies with a set (minus the worthless bracers) as a hitting 40 present.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think Nisi is 100% in all fo what he says , i completely agree with him before i even read this thread. I found easy , if you are a high roller and can spare a few gold. To go to Tanaris make a few shouts about asking for lower levels to help you skin for a couple gold . Worked for me :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mumsie</b></h3>Land's Edge Beach in Tanaris drops turtle scales and either thick or rugged leather Turtles spawn fast and there's no one else farming there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gimvarg</b></h3>The turtles just outside of Raventusk Village in The Hinterlands (49 and up) sometimes give 2 scales per skin. Droprate is listed as 50% and that seems fairly accurate.</div>
