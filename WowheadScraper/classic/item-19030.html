I think there should be a PVP riding skill specialized for any pvp reward mount that could be purchased with honor points or marks or both. Or lower the PVP mount riding skill to 75, but increase the amount to buy them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of the new patch, the AV Mount now only costs 8g.<br /><br />Yet you need epic riding skill to use it.&nbsp; Epic riding training costs 800g.<br /><br />This mount just got its discount nerfed, fellas.&nbsp; Might as well get an exalted mount with one of the factions for the same price or simply spend a couple months PvPing to Rank 11 so you can get that epic mount, which also costs 8g, but does not require epic riding training.<br /><br />Thanks Blizz for being completely nonsensical about one more thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, ever since the last patch the prices for the -mounts- got dropped significantly, I felt like buying this... so I did. e_e; I'm a night elf so I look odd riding it lol but it's spiffy and I might start collecting different racial mounts in the future. <br /><br />Since I already had my lvl 40 and epic mount prior to the patch, I didn't need to buy any training... poor guys who have to though... 'cause the price for the whole of buying this mount is a kind of ripoff now, since it used to cost 600 something gold and now, if you have no epic mount, you need to pay 800g+ for everything. At least the Rank 11 PvP mounts only need lvl 40 riding skill training... ugh, 4 more ranks to go, then I can buy 3 of the mounts for 8g each. ^^<br /><br />Correct me if I'm wrong on any of the pricing info... just relying on memory now...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I know you need to be exalted with Stormpike and all which doesn't take long.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If I were to spend the time to get my 50 marks of honor for this, would I still have to buy training which is really expensive as of the new patch...?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sorta confused...<br /><br />so I'm a 62 NE with a regular 60% frostsaber. to get a fast ram, I need exalted with AV, 50 marks, and epic riding skill (currently my riding skill is 75)? Do I need specifically ram riding skill? Can I just learn the riding skill in any major city or do I need to go to Dar or do I need to get it from the dwarves? damn I thought I was so close to a fast mount and now it looks grim...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To clarify this issue of understanding you no longer need to be exalted with AV or If. It now costs 50 AV tokens which will take you a bit to farm, but in time you'll get there. It does not require and special riding skill anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Before the patch, it was 600 something g, now it's 10g, but, you have to pay 720g for the training?<br />No, that's just plain retarded.<br />GG Blizz, GG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if you are full exalted, with, say - ironforge, you can get training at ram or mechanostrider vendors for 540g. so if you can even FIND an AV anymore, turn in those armor scraps, medals, and crystals! it adds up eventually.</div>
