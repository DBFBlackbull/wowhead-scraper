<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So...did you perhaps fail elementary school math? Thottbot lists a 7% drop rate, which means an average of 1 drop every 14 kills. Assuming 50/50 chance of either 1 or 2 druids per run, that means, statistically, you've got at least 20 runs before you should start expecting a book. You ought to be thankful that you're almost right on the money statistically and that you didn't catch the short end of that straw.<br /><br />Come back with that attitude when you've got a string of 50+ Beast kills with no book drops at all. Better yet, take the time of two or three UBRS runs to go and farm the 200g instead and just buy it off the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hello Bizzard. <br /><br />If someone in youre company reads this.<br />You need to set a higher droprate on this so the price falls. Im a feral druid myself and i have done over 10 UBRS runs now and no drop.<br />Feral druids get alot of crap from other classes. &quot;Youre a druid! You should heal! thats youre job&quot; I hear it everyday. But im sticking with it, and I will not be a heal bot. NEVER! So push the droprate up on this book and make some god damn 2H maces with alot of STR and STA. Same goes for armor. Its so boring beeing feral couse its no weapons and gear for us. So make it more fun please.<br /><br />Love you all.<br />Sincerely yours Whiner2K6.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im so lucky! No druid in the group, greed roll. only 7 grolled it, dont know why the other 3 didint bother :) And didint i say it, it was my first run :) Book strait to AH!</div>
