The guide is broken out thusly:\n\n1. Requirements and Recommendations\n\n2. The Rules and The Realities\n\n3. Best Practices\n\n4. Rewards\n\n5. Post tournament rewards\n\nRequirements and Recommendations\n\nIt is a common misconception that this tournament can only be won by a level 60 player. Well I am here to tell you that this is most certainly NOT the case. The tournament is held in STV with good reason: the only requirement to compete in the tournament is that you are able to fish in the STV zone, which means that you must have a Fishing skill of no less than 150, making it possible for anyone able to survive the STV zone to have access to the tournament. However, the rewards of the initial competition do require higher levels of achievement (see the Rewards section for more details).\n\nThat stated, it is recommended that anyone entering the tournament to win be at least level 50 so as to not aggro the mobs that roam the coastline, and have a Fishing skill in the 225+ range to avoid the need for lures (lure application slows your cast rate). As a Horde player, we are also blessed with a distinct advantage in fishing pole selection, so it is wholeheartedly recommended that you complete the quest in the Hinterlands to get Nat Pagle�s Extreme Angler FC-5000, which gives a +25 to your Fishing skill. I also have a fishing enchant on a ratty pair of gloves, which gives an additional +2 to your skill. It may seem insignificant, but it could be the difference between a catch and a �Fish got away!�\n\nFinally, and I cannot state this strenuously enough, you need a good fishing mod. There are two available out there right now, FishEase and TackleBox, and I personally prefer the latter. TackleBox has a very simple interface and includes the ability to turn on and off self-luring of your pole. It also adds an interface for swapping between your tackle (pole, glove, etc.) and your normal gear, which is pretty swank. Finally, TB is compatible with the Nat Pagle pole, whereas the last release of FishEase that I used was not.\n\nEssentially what that means is that, with a fishing pole equipped, you only have to right- click to cast out rather than setting a hotkey, which is a MAJOR plus. Spend a little time pre-tournament fishing with this mod to familiarize yourself with the options available, notably FastCast and EasyCast. You will always want those two on, and they make a huge difference when you see your cast rate versus someone else in the tournament. If you have a high enough skill, leave EasyLure off, as it will just take time away from efficient casting.\n\nThe Rules and The Realities\n\nThe STVFE occurs every Sunday from 2pm � 4pm server time. At 2pm a yell will emanate from BB that the fishing tournament has begun, and swirl spawns will appear in the water, designated as �School of Tastyfish�. The locations of these spawns are static, but the spawns themselves will disappear after a designated number of fish caught, forcing contestants to not only be able to fish well, but be quick on their feet\/horse. The object of the main tournament is to catch 40 Speckled Tastyfish from these pools and return them to Riggle Bassbait just outside of the inn in Booty Bay as quickly as possible. Be on the coast, at your fishing spot, with your pole in hand at 2pm or be prepared for a long uphill fight.\n\nThe realities of this tournament are thus: The main tournament will end no later than 40 minutes into the 2 hour fishing window. I have finished the tournament in times of roughly 37, 32, and 29 minutes each, and the Alliance players that have won in the past have typically done so in the 35-40 minute range. It is essential that you focus all of your energies on catching fish and being aware of where you are, how many fish you�ve caught from a pool, and where you will be going next. Having a fast horse and carrot really helps, and if you have a high enough skill in Fishing and have a pair of gloves with riding enchant on them, I recommend using them instead. If you are catching 1 or more fish per minute, you�re going to be competitive, and time between fishing holes increases as your mount speed decreases.\n\nBest Practices\n\nThese are things that I have found to be successful guidelines when fishing the tourney, in no particular order.\n\n1. Ancient Chinese Secret � Start the tournament on the east coast of STV, around location 41,58. There is a spot there where two tastyfish spawns appear within 30 yards of each other, and they usually spawn up simultaneously when the tournament begins. If no one else is around that�s a surefire way to get WAY ahead of the competition. In some cases you may even be able to fish the first spawn, move to the next, and by the time you�re done with the second the first pool will have respawned, making for Super-Happy- Fishing. There are a total of 5 spawn points right there on the coast, around the hill and in the ruins in the water. Make sure you scout the area a couple of days before the tournament begins, to ensure that you don�t give the spot away to someone else out there.\n\nAs the tournament progresses, you�ll slowly shift south down the coast to the areas where the pirates are, but make sure you work yourself both north and south from time to time, and try to run counter to the herd. If everyone is going north, go south and vice-versa. And if you have someone tailing you all the time, skip a pool and hit the next one, so that when you finish it before they do, you can get 1-2 fish up on the next pool down the coast before they get to it.\n\n2. One is the loneliest (and happiest) number � The tastyfish spawns that appear along the coastline only contain about 4-5 drops each, and despawn once they have reached their limit, similar to mining nodes. If you are fishing a pool and have caught a few fish already when someone else shows up, finish your catch and move on to the next spawn. You only have a 50-50 chance to catch the last fish in the pool, and it�s up to 30 seconds wasted if you don�t. As a general rule, don�t fish pools that someone else is already at, as they could have fished it close to dry already; instead, find a fresh pool to hit and get maximum potential from each spawn. If you�re running behind and have to share a pool, do so with no more than 1 other person. Otherwise the spawn will go down quickly and you�ll still be left scrambling to make up time.\n\n3. Good angles make good anglers � Many of the spawns that appear along the coastline are in shallow waters, some in cramped quarters along the shoreline that make casting difficult. I can�t count the number of �Your cast did not land in fishable water� messages that I�ve gotten when attempting to fish these wedge spots, and I find that many people just give up on them. The key is to position yourself so that you have the maximum amount of water in front of you as possible. Your cast will land in a cone roughly 35 degrees either way of plumb center of your character�s facing position, and outward roughly 30 yards. The spawns don�t go out that far, so as long as you have enough water on either side of you to cover those 70 degrees of cast angle, you should be fine. In some cases, though, even that isn�t enough to keep the error from appearing, and in those cases I recommend standing in the water itself, which in most cases will get you good casts. Don�t ask me why, I didn�t code the fishing program, I just bend it to my will.\n\n4. Keep your enemies closer, but keep the fishing spawn away � Some of the fishing spawns on the coast are really close to the shore, while some others are somewhat far out in the water. Position yourself about 10-15 yards away from the spawn to get maximum cast potential, as your bobber has to land within the spawn to catch tastyfish. Given that the cast range of the pole is 30 yards, and the spawn is roughly 5 yards wide, putting the spawn in the center of that distribution will maximize the number of casts that land inside the pool. This advice runs counter in some instances to the advice given in item 3, but use your best judgment to decide which is going to be more advantageous in the given scenario.\n\n5. Alignment is key to good posture and Feng Shui � I have been witness to many people who run up to a fishing spawn and, rather than take the time to line up directly with the spawn facing straight out, haphazardly line up at an angle to the beach and just start casting. This causes two problems: first, their angle sometimes lends to getting miscasts that land on the beach, which impacts their catch rate. Second, they increase their distance from the spawn versus someone aligned plumb, which puts the spawn outside of the sweet-spot. I have consistently beaten them in fish count in these pools, and it�s because I get better casts off. When you align yourself correctly with the pool, you can get much more consistent distance control before you cast out, you increase your cast angle probabilities, and you put yourself in better position for when the pool despawns to go in either direction.\n\n6. If at first you don�t succeed, cast, cast again � This is where TackleBox comes into play. In order to catch tastyfish, your bobber has to land within the swirl of the spawn. Judge by the distance and angle of the line whether your bobber is going to be in that spot, and if not, just right-click again to recast. Keep doing this as quickly and efficiently as possible to maximize catch rate. Another thing to do to verify that you�re inside the swirl is to angle your camera top-down, which I�m sure most people know how to do by heart. The ability to win this tournament is far and away dictated by who can hit the swirl most effectively, and knowing your camera angles and understanding the distances and angles of your fishing line will greatly help you in that department.\n\n7. Booty Bay may be a stone�s throw away, but set your stone for it anyway (hey, that rhymes) � It may seem insignificant, but running all the way through BB to get to Riggle may be just enough time for someone else to catch their 40 and stone back to the inn and beat you to him. Be absolutely sure your hearthstone is set for BB before you set out for your fishing spot, as it could be the difference between a good day and a really frustrating one.\n\n8. Fish for rizzeal hizzere, fish for rizzares thizzeres � Once the tournament has concluded, don�t continue to fish the east coast. Inevitably some Alliance punk is going to show up to grief you (usually about 15 seconds after you win on the dock in BB), and you don�t want to give up any trade secrets, lest the detestable Alliance learn2fish more. Once the tournament is over most of the people who are just there to win the trinket will disappear, which will make the spawn availability much greater. Head over to the west coast and fish all the way from BB to Grom�Gol, although I don�t recommend going any further north than the river mouth to the south of GG. There�s a set of small island-ish rocks at one point along the way, and there are a couple of spawns that appear out near those rocks, so grab them if they�re up.\n\nRewards\n\nThe rewards for winning the tournament are thus:\n\nArcanite Fishing Pole � Requirement: Fishing (300) So you don�t have to be level 60 to use it, but you do have to have your fishing skill maxed.\n\nHook of the Master Angler � Requirement: Level 60 While you don�t have to be level 60 to compete in this tournament, you do have to be level 60 to use this baby. I�ve heard that it�s slower than Druid seal-form, but faster than the swim speed glove enchant. It�s not bad. I use it on long swims, but not for any quick jaunts across a river. The cooldown is pretty quick too.\n\nPost tournament rewards\n\nThere are a few other rewards not mentioned above, both for competing in the tournament and for catching special �rare� fish. These rewards are not linked to the main event tournament, and you can continue to fish the coasts of STV until 4pm even after the main event has concluded. At 4pm another yell will sound out from BB signaling the end of the tournament, at which time the tastyfish spawns will disappear.\n\nAt any time you can turn your tastyfish haul in to the goblin next to Riggle Bassbait for monetary compensation, at the rate of 23 silver per 5 tastyfish. It�s one of those repeatable things, so you just have to keep clicking on her to get more money until you�re out of fish. If you have extras just toss em, since they�re soulbound and will just stink up your bags while they rot in there. They only have a lifespan of 4 hours, so you can�t save them for the next tournament (that wouldn�t be fair).\n\nAlso, there are special rare fish to be caught in the pools, which can be turned in to Fishbot 5000 next to Riggle for special fishing gear. The fish below can be turned in for the gear next to it:\n\nDezian Queenfish � High Test Eternium Fishing Line - Brownell's Blue Striped Racer � Nat Pagle�s Extreme Anglin� Boots Keefer's Angelfish � Lucky Fishing Hat\n\nEach of these items adds an additional +5 to your Fishing skill. In all, with these items, the Arcanite Fishing Pole, and a pair of enchanted fishing gloves, you can achieve a Fishing skill of 352 without a lure! Put another way, you can fish the Plaguelands without a lure, which is just ludicrous.\n\nI have reaped almost all of the rewards of this tournament, and I want to pass this information on to you. That sounded corny but w\/e :P.

Note that this does not take into account the other items that can be fished from tastyfish spawns (stranglekelp, oily blackmouths, ect), so a more accurate description would be for any number of tastyfish caught, an average of x% will be rare, where x is the following:\n\n[b]Keefer's Angelfish: 0.25%[\/b] (1 in every 400 tastyfish)\n\n[b]Dezien Queenfish: 0.22%[\/b] (1 in every 450 tastyfish)\n\n[b]Brownell's Blue Striped Racer : 0.18%[\/b] (1 in every 550 tastyfish)\n\n[b]ANY rare fish: 0.65%[\/b] (1 in every 150 tastyfish)\n\nSo if you were to catch 100 tastyfish every Sunday (which is about how many I usually get), you would have a 22% chance to get the Angelfish, or a 48% chance to get any rare fish.&nbsp; The person above me had an 86% chance to get ANY rare fish, or a 53% chance to get an angelfish, assuming he got 300 fish total for the 3 weeks he fished.&nbsp; 14% chance to not get any rare fish is not BS or even that bad of luck.&nbsp; Personally, I've probably caught around 750-1000 tastyfish, and have found 3 x Dezien Queenfish.&nbsp; My chance of finding an angelfish with that many caught is somewhere around 90%.&nbsp; I shall keep on trying...\n\nI don't see why Blizzard would make the droprates different for each individual fish, so we can probably assume that they share the same rate (The average is 0.22%).&nbsp; With this in mind, there is obviously a rather large margain of error for these rates.&nbsp; This is because there is very little data on thottbot for the fishing competition (only a total of 233 rare fish are recorded at this time).&nbsp; If you wish to help, run thottbot while you farm and upload your data.","date":"2007-01-26T06:27:36-06:00","rating":115,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Sancho69","importedSubject":"Stats"},{"commentv2":1,"number":19,"id":2712936,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"U can find the fish all around in whole STV but i dont really know the best place to fish em for a lvl 10-19 just get a higher lvl to guard u so u dont get attacked.

Rez sickness FTW! <br /><br />There is a group of &quot;very&quot; small islands in that area that spawn pools of fish. Just a few non-aggro crabs wandering around. I suggest you take some Swim Speed Potion with you; I forgot :(<br /><br />So much fun running around Org as a level 11 with hat and boots.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I noticed a few posts in this thread about how high fishing skill, with fishing accessories, is going to help them win this tournament.&nbsp; Note that higher skills do not help you attract more fish or catch more fish quicker.&nbsp; It just means that you can actually fish in an area and that some of the high end fish won't get away.&nbsp; The Tournament is set up so that if you have the skill to fish in STV, even if you have to use accessories (bait), you will be on equal footing with everyone else, no tasty fish will escape you.&nbsp; (Except for the aggroing mob issue for lower levels of course.)<br /><br />In other words, if a player with fishing skill 50 is fishing in a noob fishing area with another player with skill 425, you will each be able to catch all the fish, and luck will determine how fast you catch them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Every Sunday.<br />Server time 2pm to 4pm.<br />Ends in Booty Bay, Stranglethorn Vale (so make the inn your home)<br />Requires 40 Speckled Tasty Fish to win (prize is a +35 rod)<br />Also there are 3 special fish that can be turned in for +5 Line, +5 Hat, +5 Boots (all Soulbound)<br />If you dont win then 5 Speckled Tasty Fish sell for 23s. They can be sold for the hour after the competition runs. They dont keep...<br />Speckled Tasty Fish Pools appear all around the STV coast. Fishing them seems to be limited to 5 or so catches - then they disappear for a number of minutes. So early on there are lots of fishermen using the same pool you may find it disappears before your catch (i.e. wasted 30 seconds). Other annoyances are Mithril Chests, Strangleweed etc which you catch instead.<br />TTBOMK: To fish the sea you need 225 - that can be a 125 skill with a +100 attractor. Obviously you have to pay for them and apply them so a higher skill saves time. More chance of failing a catch, no catching etc with lower skills.<br />Also the coast is hostile, so lvl below 40 a liability and lvl 60 an advantage.<br />Shortest time I've seen is 29 mins, longest 50 mins for the winner (but keep going as 100 fish = 4g60s and you might get a special fish)<br />Remember to pack sandwiches and a drink to save you having to move from the PC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just an FYI - won the fishing tounament yesterday using no lures nor attractors of any kind and using the basic fishing pole (2-4 DPS) bought from vendor for pennies...i.e., my fishing skill was 300 (base lvl) for the duration of the tournament. My char is lvl 48 and was attacked once during the tournament by a Naga...had to swim out to sea until it retreated and I could safely return to shore. Moreover, hardly ever used my mount and didn't use any of the swim speed potions I had used in previous tournaments (to cross coves). Fishing Buddy mod disable as well, due to recent WOW system upgrades. Naturally, I was surprised to have won. I suspect the competition was light for yesterdays tournament. Just wanted to provide encouragement for the lesser equiped participants out there....and to boast a little.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After you catch the fish you turn it into the Fishbot 5000.&nbsp; The Fishbot is in Booty Bay right outside of the inn, he'll have a blue question mark over his head.&nbsp; On a side note: I can't wait to get this on my 19 hunter, I got the boots from the Fishbot, just need the hat....so much stamina. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In <b>Stranglethorn Vale</b> every sunday from server time <b>2PM - 4 PM</b>, there is a fishing tournament. During the tournament, all around STV there will spawn schools of special fish called &quot;Speckled Tastyfish&quot;.<br /><br />The tournament is over when a player catches 40 fish and turns them in to the tournament master. <b>The schools of fish still appear after someone wins the tournament, so you can fish for the full two hours.</b><br /><br />However, winning the tournament is irrelevant. <b>Getting the Lucky Fishing Hat is acheived only when, while fishing inside the circle of the Pool of Tastyfish, you catch a rare fish called &quot;Keefer's Angelfish&quot;. </b><br /><br />Upon catching the unique fish, go to Booty Bay and turn it in to the proper NPC. The NPC is mechanical, and *I think* has a blue question mark over his head. <br /><br />There are three different rare fish you can possibly fish up. Each yield different rewards when turned in. <br /><br /><b>-One fish gives you an &quot;Eternium Line&quot; that you can attach to any fishing pole, permanently increasing Fishing by 5.</b><br /><br /><b>-One fish gives you cloth boots with +12 stamina and +5 fishing. </b><br /><br /><b>-And finally, the Keefer's Angelfish yields the Lucky Fishing Hat.</b><br /><br />I have this hat on my level 19 twink, and, I can tell you, with an HP +100 Arcanum of Constitution enchant on it, it's a beast. <br /><br />Check me out on Magtheridon, my name is Symbol and I'm a level 19 paladin.<br /><br />Here's a shot of it in action:<br /><a href="http://will.cheesepizza.net/templates/temp/graphics/Symbol.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://will.cheesepizza.net/templates/temp/graphics/Symbol.jpg</a><br /><br />Peace out and good luck fishing!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a (current) three-time winner of the STVFE, I feel that I have established a set of best practices for success in this tournament, and wanted to build an authoritative guide for the guild so that others can achieve the same level of success and reap the same rewards. The guide is broken out thusly:<br /><br />1. Requirements and Recommendations<br /><br />2. The Rules and The Realities<br /><br />3. Best Practices<br /><br />4. Rewards<br /><br />5. Post tournament rewards<br /><br />Requirements and Recommendations<br /><br />It is a common misconception that this tournament can only be won by a level 60 player. Well I am here to tell you that this is most certainly NOT the case. The tournament is held in STV with good reason: the only requirement to compete in the tournament is that you are able to fish in the STV zone, which means that you must have a Fishing skill of no less than 150, making it possible for anyone able to survive the STV zone to have access to the tournament. However, the rewards of the initial competition do require higher levels of achievement (see the Rewards section for more details).<br /><br />That stated, it is recommended that anyone entering the tournament to win be at least level 50 so as to not aggro the mobs that roam the coastline, and have a Fishing skill in the 225+ range to avoid the need for lures (lure application slows your cast rate). As a Horde player, we are also blessed with a distinct advantage in fishing pole selection, so it is wholeheartedly recommended that you complete the quest in the Hinterlands to get Nat Pagle�s Extreme Angler FC-5000, which gives a +25 to your Fishing skill. I also have a fishing enchant on a ratty pair of gloves, which gives an additional +2 to your skill. It may seem insignificant, but it could be the difference between a catch and a �Fish got away!�<br /><br />Finally, and I cannot state this strenuously enough, you need a good fishing mod. There are two available out there right now, FishEase and TackleBox, and I personally prefer the latter. TackleBox has a very simple interface and includes the ability to turn on and off self-luring of your pole. It also adds an interface for swapping between your tackle (pole, glove, etc.) and your normal gear, which is pretty swank. Finally, TB is compatible with the Nat Pagle pole, whereas the last release of FishEase that I used was not.<br /><br />Essentially what that means is that, with a fishing pole equipped, you only have to right- click to cast out rather than setting a hotkey, which is a MAJOR plus. Spend a little time pre-tournament fishing with this mod to familiarize yourself with the options available, notably FastCast and EasyCast. You will always want those two on, and they make a huge difference when you see your cast rate versus someone else in the tournament. If you have a high enough skill, leave EasyLure off, as it will just take time away from efficient casting.<br /><br />The Rules and The Realities<br /><br />The STVFE occurs every Sunday from 2pm � 4pm server time. At 2pm a yell will emanate from BB that the fishing tournament has begun, and swirl spawns will appear in the water, designated as �School of Tastyfish�. The locations of these spawns are static, but the spawns themselves will disappear after a designated number of fish caught, forcing contestants to not only be able to fish well, but be quick on their feet/horse. The object of the main tournament is to catch 40 Speckled Tastyfish from these pools and return them to Riggle Bassbait just outside of the inn in Booty Bay as quickly as possible. Be on the coast, at your fishing spot, with your pole in hand at 2pm or be prepared for a long uphill fight.<br /><br />The realities of this tournament are thus: The main tournament will end no later than 40 minutes into the 2 hour fishing window. I have finished the tournament in times of roughly 37, 32, and 29 minutes each, and the Alliance players that have won in the past have typically done so in the 35-40 minute range. It is essential that you focus all of your energies on catching fish and being aware of where you are, how many fish you�ve caught from a pool, and where you will be going next. Having a fast horse and carrot really helps, and if you have a high enough skill in Fishing and have a pair of gloves with riding enchant on them, I recommend using them instead. If you are catching 1 or more fish per minute, you�re going to be competitive, and time between fishing holes increases as your mount speed decreases.<br /><br />Best Practices<br /><br />These are things that I have found to be successful guidelines when fishing the tourney, in no particular order.<br /><br />1. Ancient Chinese Secret � Start the tournament on the east coast of STV, around location 41,58. There is a spot there where two tastyfish spawns appear within 30 yards of each other, and they usually spawn up simultaneously when the tournament begins. If no one else is around that�s a surefire way to get WAY ahead of the competition. In some cases you may even be able to fish the first spawn, move to the next, and by the time you�re done with the second the first pool will have respawned, making for Super-Happy- Fishing. There are a total of 5 spawn points right there on the coast, around the hill and in the ruins in the water. Make sure you scout the area a couple of days before the tournament begins, to ensure that you don�t give the spot away to someone else out there.<br /><br />As the tournament progresses, you�ll slowly shift south down the coast to the areas where the pirates are, but make sure you work yourself both north and south from time to time, and try to run counter to the herd. If everyone is going north, go south and vice-versa. And if you have someone tailing you all the time, skip a pool and hit the next one, so that when you finish it before they do, you can get 1-2 fish up on the next pool down the coast before they get to it.<br /><br />2. One is the loneliest (and happiest) number � The tastyfish spawns that appear along the coastline only contain about 4-5 drops each, and despawn once they have reached their limit, similar to mining nodes. If you are fishing a pool and have caught a few fish already when someone else shows up, finish your catch and move on to the next spawn. You only have a 50-50 chance to catch the last fish in the pool, and it�s up to 30 seconds wasted if you don�t. As a general rule, don�t fish pools that someone else is already at, as they could have fished it close to dry already; instead, find a fresh pool to hit and get maximum potential from each spawn. If you�re running behind and have to share a pool, do so with no more than 1 other person. Otherwise the spawn will go down quickly and you�ll still be left scrambling to make up time.<br /><br />3. Good angles make good anglers � Many of the spawns that appear along the coastline are in shallow waters, some in cramped quarters along the shoreline that make casting difficult. I can�t count the number of �Your cast did not land in fishable water� messages that I�ve gotten when attempting to fish these wedge spots, and I find that many people just give up on them. The key is to position yourself so that you have the maximum amount of water in front of you as possible. Your cast will land in a cone roughly 35 degrees either way of plumb center of your character�s facing position, and outward roughly 30 yards. The spawns don�t go out that far, so as long as you have enough water on either side of you to cover those 70 degrees of cast angle, you should be fine. In some cases, though, even that isn�t enough to keep the error from appearing, and in those cases I recommend standing in the water itself, which in most cases will get you good casts. Don�t ask me why, I didn�t code the fishing program, I just bend it to my will.<br /><br />4. Keep your enemies closer, but keep the fishing spawn away � Some of the fishing spawns on the coast are really close to the shore, while some others are somewhat far out in the water. Position yourself about 10-15 yards away from the spawn to get maximum cast potential, as your bobber has to land within the spawn to catch tastyfish. Given that the cast range of the pole is 30 yards, and the spawn is roughly 5 yards wide, putting the spawn in the center of that distribution will maximize the number of casts that land inside the pool. This advice runs counter in some instances to the advice given in item 3, but use your best judgment to decide which is going to be more advantageous in the given scenario.<br /><br />5. Alignment is key to good posture and Feng Shui � I have been witness to many people who run up to a fishing spawn and, rather than take the time to line up directly with the spawn facing straight out, haphazardly line up at an angle to the beach and just start casting. This causes two problems: first, their angle sometimes lends to getting miscasts that land on the beach, which impacts their catch rate. Second, they increase their distance from the spawn versus someone aligned plumb, which puts the spawn outside of the sweet-spot. I have consistently beaten them in fish count in these pools, and it�s because I get better casts off. When you align yourself correctly with the pool, you can get much more consistent distance control before you cast out, you increase your cast angle probabilities, and you put yourself in better position for when the pool despawns to go in either direction.<br /><br />6. If at first you don�t succeed, cast, cast again � This is where TackleBox comes into play. In order to catch tastyfish, your bobber has to land within the swirl of the spawn. Judge by the distance and angle of the line whether your bobber is going to be in that spot, and if not, just right-click again to recast. Keep doing this as quickly and efficiently as possible to maximize catch rate. Another thing to do to verify that you�re inside the swirl is to angle your camera top-down, which I�m sure most people know how to do by heart. The ability to win this tournament is far and away dictated by who can hit the swirl most effectively, and knowing your camera angles and understanding the distances and angles of your fishing line will greatly help you in that department.<br /><br />7. Booty Bay may be a stone�s throw away, but set your stone for it anyway (hey, that rhymes) � It may seem insignificant, but running all the way through BB to get to Riggle may be just enough time for someone else to catch their 40 and stone back to the inn and beat you to him. Be absolutely sure your hearthstone is set for BB before you set out for your fishing spot, as it could be the difference between a good day and a really frustrating one.<br /><br />8. Fish for rizzeal hizzere, fish for rizzares thizzeres � Once the tournament has concluded, don�t continue to fish the east coast. Inevitably some Alliance punk is going to show up to grief you (usually about 15 seconds after you win on the dock in BB), and you don�t want to give up any trade secrets, lest the detestable Alliance learn2fish more. Once the tournament is over most of the people who are just there to win the trinket will disappear, which will make the spawn availability much greater. Head over to the west coast and fish all the way from BB to Grom�Gol, although I don�t recommend going any further north than the river mouth to the south of GG. There�s a set of small island-ish rocks at one point along the way, and there are a couple of spawns that appear out near those rocks, so grab them if they�re up.<br /><br />Rewards<br /><br />The rewards for winning the tournament are thus:<br /><br />Arcanite Fishing Pole � Requirement: Fishing (300) So you don�t have to be level 60 to use it, but you do have to have your fishing skill maxed.<br /><br />Hook of the Master Angler � Requirement: Level 60 While you don�t have to be level 60 to compete in this tournament, you do have to be level 60 to use this baby. I�ve heard that it�s slower than Druid seal-form, but faster than the swim speed glove enchant. It�s not bad. I use it on long swims, but not for any quick jaunts across a river. The cooldown is pretty quick too.<br /><br />Post tournament rewards<br /><br />There are a few other rewards not mentioned above, both for competing in the tournament and for catching special �rare� fish. These rewards are not linked to the main event tournament, and you can continue to fish the coasts of STV until 4pm even after the main event has concluded. At 4pm another yell will sound out from BB signaling the end of the tournament, at which time the tastyfish spawns will disappear.<br /><br />At any time you can turn your tastyfish haul in to the goblin next to Riggle Bassbait for monetary compensation, at the rate of 23 silver per 5 tastyfish. It�s one of those repeatable things, so you just have to keep clicking on her to get more money until you�re out of fish. If you have extras just toss em, since they�re soulbound and will just stink up your bags while they rot in there. They only have a lifespan of 4 hours, so you can�t save them for the next tournament (that wouldn�t be fair).<br /><br />Also, there are special rare fish to be caught in the pools, which can be turned in to Fishbot 5000 next to Riggle for special fishing gear. The fish below can be turned in for the gear next to it:<br /><br />Dezian Queenfish � High Test Eternium Fishing Line - Brownell's Blue Striped Racer � Nat Pagle�s Extreme Anglin� Boots Keefer's Angelfish � Lucky Fishing Hat<br /><br />Each of these items adds an additional +5 to your Fishing skill. In all, with these items, the Arcanite Fishing Pole, and a pair of enchanted fishing gloves, you can achieve a Fishing skill of 352 without a lure! Put another way, you can fish the Plaguelands without a lure, which is just ludicrous.<br /><br />I have reaped almost all of the rewards of this tournament, and I want to pass this information on to you. That sounded corny but w/e :P. Enjoy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, I did these stats AGAIN, please upvote this post so it doesn't get deleted another time.&nbsp; Since people didn't seem to understand how I got these numbers before, I will explain them.<br /><br />When thottbot tracks data, it does not (and probably cannot) record conditions such as if a fishing bobber was inside a tastyfish spawn.&nbsp; Therefore, it isn't possible to get a &quot;droprate&quot; for the fish.&nbsp; So, the only way to get a feel for how often the rare fish drop is to compare its data to that of tastyfish, since tastyfish are the only other item caught exclusively under the exact same conditions as the rare fish.&nbsp; Fortunately, we know the number of tastyfish that have been caught, as well as how many rare fish.<br /><br />This logic would be flawed if, for example, tastyfish could be caught in the competition long before rare fish were added, therefore making the tastyfish seem more common.&nbsp; Since, to my knowledge, the rare fish always have been there since the competition started, we can simply divide the number of rare fish caught by the number of tastyfish. Note that this does not take into account the other items that can be fished from tastyfish spawns (stranglekelp, oily blackmouths, ect), so a more accurate description would be for any number of tastyfish caught, an average of x% will be rare, where x is the following:<br /><br /><b>Keefer's Angelfish: 0.25%</b> (1 in every 400 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>Dezien Queenfish: 0.22%</b> (1 in every 450 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>Brownell's Blue Striped Racer : 0.18%</b> (1 in every 550 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>ANY rare fish: 0.65%</b> (1 in every 150 tastyfish)<br /><br />So if you were to catch 100 tastyfish every Sunday (which is about how many I usually get), you would have a 22% chance to get the Angelfish, or a 48% chance to get any rare fish.&nbsp; The person above me had an 86% chance to get ANY rare fish, or a 53% chance to get an angelfish, assuming he got 300 fish total for the 3 weeks he fished.&nbsp; 14% chance to not get any rare fish is not BS or even that bad of luck.&nbsp; Personally, I've probably caught around 750-1000 tastyfish, and have found 3 x Dezien Queenfish.&nbsp; My chance of finding an angelfish with that many caught is somewhere around 90%.&nbsp; I shall keep on trying...<br /><br />I don't see why Blizzard would make the droprates different for each individual fish, so we can probably assume that they share the same rate (The average is 0.22%).&nbsp; With this in mind, there is obviously a rather large margain of error for these rates.&nbsp; This is because there is very little data on thottbot for the fishing competition (only a total of 233 rare fish are recorded at this time).&nbsp; If you wish to help, run thottbot while you farm and upload your data.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>U can find the fish all around in whole STV but i dont really know the best place to fish em for a lvl 10-19 just get a higher lvl to guard u so u dont get attacked. Make sure to pay him well cuz it can take a long time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On my lvl 19 twink, a good place to go is Yojamba Isle. It's inhabited by trolls, and you'll find it on the top left part of the map, above a bigger isle that has mobs on it. Do not go there. You will be safe there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I won the hat yesterday...its pretty cool looking even though im a hunter, well i didn't take it off until i won the gladiator helm from BRD but i like wearing the hat to pick Blood Elf chicks in Orgrimmar. i gotta try for the pole or boots next week, and i can make the fish attractor</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Personally I think Green Tinted Goggles is better than this now. The goggles are BoE which means you can send it to your main and enchant Glyph of the Defender on it (17 Dodge Rating and 15 Defense Rating), and I think at least for rogues 5 dodge is better than 7 stamina (17-12 since you probably have the 12 dodge libram (Libram of Protection) enchanted on the hat if u get it. Hunters can get the Cenarion Expedition glyph that gives 34 AP and 16 hit rating, theres also one with healing and mp5, and one with spelldmg and spell crit. (For druids twinks Glyph of the outcast, giving 17 strenght and intellect)<br /><br />For further information on how to enchant the glyph for your twink, search Inscription of Warding, there is explained how to do it there.<br /><br />And if the rumours that the Hat will get nerfed in the next patch, you don't even have to think about getting it anymore. Although I assume if they nerf it, I think people who already have it equipped will not lose it. And why would they nerf the hat and not the boots? <br /><br />Eg,<br />Dunemaul (Alliance)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vensferatu</b></h3>For those that are curious and are wardrobe completionists like me, you can still catch these green quality fish after the tournament ends on live. Since they changed the Tasty Fish to quest items your catches after the winners have been made tend to all be nothing, but are in fact just the tasty fish that can no longer be collected. The green hand in fish, however, do still drop in the catch window if you're lucky enough to catch them, so you have until the 4pm cut off every week to try and get those missing wardrobe skins.</div>
