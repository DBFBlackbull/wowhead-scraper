So I got tired and went sleep, next time I logged in I went back and it dropped from the third mob I killed. I believe if it's taking hours to get an item to drop then it's obviously not time for it to drop, illogical as that may sound. Just go back to it in a few hours, you should have a better chance and less frustration. That's my theory and it's been working for me.</div>

Since Netherguard is south a wrong turn would be North. North in a little ravine is many swampwalkers and tangled horrors, he also states he was surrounded by many, unlike the ones walking around alone outside of Misty valley. Kill them here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lrn to get lucky&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Just turn left immediately upon entering the SoS.&nbsp; There is an alcove with nothing but elementals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ye very low drop % since I have already got 2 same enchant recipe and still not q item :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>one lap around the mist valley and it dropped..<br />good place if youre an herbalist since a recipie drops and various plants on the elementals</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone else is right, these things do have a terrible drop rate. I cleared the valley 3 times, killed the lord 3 three times, and finally after about an hour it dropped off a regular swampwalker near the front, not an elder one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I wiped the entire area clean three times, then it finally dtopped. Killed about 30 mobs to do it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>See it as grinding. If you were grinding them you would be doing the same thing. Now you're doing it for the quest, not only xp. I'm just going to continue here :P .. i have been here for over an hour and no drop.. but i did fill half my xp bar with 'm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is not a quick quest. As the previous comment stated, filled over half my xp bar with grinding these critters. Lvl 42 Paladin and the drop came the fourth time around the area. Got ot from the Mire Lord in the cave. I think it is worth the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I ran around here with my 43 lock for about an hour with no luck. I must have cleared it 15 times. Since I found a quest crate in the area I decided to go turn it in to Nethergarde and come back. One the VERY FIRST kill upon returning, I got the book. What an odd drop rate for such an otherwise simple quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These were a piece3 of cake after reading them and having spent 10 min u feel like it will take forever it felt like i spent 30 min on it but it was really just 10 min.&nbsp; if u get frustrated log off for 3 min geta drink, w/e come back and it shoould come up as long as you persist you can get a drop off any of those elementals</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, i have killed now for like 2 and a half hour.. and it has not dropped YET! omg so tired of theese bug quests..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found Khadgar's Essays in the NW corner just below the two lakes near Misty Valley.&nbsp; I got it after killing only my second Swampwalker.&nbsp; It was a drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got the item after roughly 15 kills. Wasn't too hard. Was expecting to be out there a while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the thing only on myu hird kill, I'm so lucky. Now I can go ge tthose boots for my rogue!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got it on the 220th drop. Only works at the corner.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For those who don;t know. U need to go to Misty Valley in Swamp of Sorrows. Entrance is 17,40.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i farmed these guys for the essays for about an hour and a half... no drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>third mob ..muaha</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>cleared back to the cave (5 or 6 elementals), then got it on the 3rd one I killed on the way back to the entrance of the area<br /><br />drop rate is listed so low because it's not a commonly done quest<br /><br />got about 5 greens, too... nice drop rate for them on the elementals</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I actually got the item from the third Tangeled Horror monster I killed and they supoosedly have the lowest percentages to drop it. I say just kill everything there from start to finish including the big guy too until you get it. It's totally random.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Good grief! Played from 8:30 till 11:15 and was a hair away from leveling. Finally fell off a swampwalker at the beginning of their small alcove. Oh well! At least I levelled up while I was there!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Very uncommon .<br />Lots of herbs drop before this does</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped on about the 45th elemental. Not too long, really.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Midnitte</b></h3>Not sure if this is something changed in Classic, but I got this on about my 10th kill, so don't let the other comments deter you.<br /><br />Also don't forget to pick up the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6172">Lost Supplies</a> quest from the nearby crates.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Truth00</b></h3>I farmed these guys in the mist valley for about an hour without getting the item.(I did get 2 enchanting herbalism patterns though) Then I killed the mire lord 3 times and it dropped the 3rd time. Also it is important to note the letter is group loot, so if you have others around doing it also, group up to increase your chances!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>scoolio</b></h3>I've run this quest twice now in Classic. In both instances it took forever to drop. I think the first time I spent nearly three hours and in the second it was about two hours. Bring lots of bag space, plenty of food, and a ton of patience. This last time it dropped off a swampwalker but omg the RNG is murder.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xertoz</b></h3>Got this after clearing the entire swamp <b>two </b>times over... Maybe this isn't a 8% drop in classic?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dannuzor</b></h3>For me it work with the log out method, 5 th mob after relog it drop .<br />So relog and give 10 min of grind . <br />GOod luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sethelton</b></h3>I came to this page to check the drop rate since I was having such a hard time finding this item. Cleared misty over 3 times and counting, still no drop! such luck xD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bulevarko</b></h3>Drop rate about 1% at best</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thready</b></h3>Drop rate is really low; had to kill 14 to get the quest item</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MEMERMAID</b></h3>Its been 2 days, I had so huge amount of rested exp that I hit from level 37 and 2 bars, level 38 and 6 bars, stil no drop...<br />At least I have 2 bags of iron and few stacks of gold ore as compensation of my time<br />Edit: I leveled 2 levels and got my item</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fingers0689</b></h3>Made an account literally just to voice my frustration about this quest. If I had to estimate, I've killed over 100 so far and still no drop....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skullcrasher</b></h3>Took 3 bars of XP at 41. 1% drop rate?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ozweeplay</b></h3>Had the area to myself at 5am (finally!) but after 3 hours and over half a level, still no drop. I did manage to level up mining quite a bit (iron nodes spawn every 10 mins or so) and you get about 2g per hour in coin, plus other herbs and random drops. Still, would have loved to have gotten the Essays at some point.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>striderevale</b></h3>THIS is the quest that should be called pool of tears. Vanilla original - TBC classic doesn't matter, the drop rate is garbage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HanzSolo</b></h3>I got this second drop at 60.1 45.0. I was doing in Search of the Temple and a Tangled Horror Lumbered by.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>uriahworld</b></h3>Got after 5 kills in the Misty Valley area, as a 46 Warlock. Classic Hardcore mode</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>littlesten</b></h3>Looking at these comments I got lucky.<br />Misty Valley - Swamp Walkers - 1st drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Flofufu</b></h3>Look at droprates in P2 of SoD, don't waste your time on killing anything else than <a href="/classic/npc=1081/mire-lord">Mire Lord</a>.<br /><br />Respawn every 2.5-5 minutes (dynamic respawn), in the meantime kill a couple <a href="/classic/npc=764/swampwalker">Swampwalker</a> for increased chances or grab a couple herbs if your layer is full of druid bots like mine.<br />Got it after 5th kill, GL.<br /><br />Btw if you're reading this and don't have a wowhead account please consider downloading the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/client">wowhead client</a>.<br />The more data we get as players the better this website gets. :)</div>
