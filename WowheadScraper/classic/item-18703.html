Make sure you have Stam \/ Int buffs. And take along a few mana pots and healing pots. If you loose all your mana you going to fail this quest!\r\n\r\nNow there is a couple of ways you can do this, most people recommend Kiting him, although I don't. If you kite you run the risk of bumping into other players or mobs. Which will make life a bit hard.\r\n\r\nOk, Tactics.\r\nEvery 15 Seconds Klifran goes into a State of Frenzy Where he will deal allot of dmg. Use Scorpid Sting ( Highest Rank ) - This will take away his Frenzy once fired at him. (Check buffs) Do NOT Fire this before 15 seconds after the 1st Frenzy other wise it wont work. Once Applied he will deal 1 dmg every hit for the next 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nSo 1st, As you walk up to him, Fire Scorpid Sting (And make sure it hits), then go melee on him, try not to use all of your mana because you will need it. Try to count to about 10 - 13 seconds after you fired the 1st shot then when you get to 10 - 13 seconds hit him with wingclip and get away from him, this will slow him down and give you enough time to get range.\r\n\r\nOnce at range, Fire the next Scorpid Sting then repeat what you just did. Keep doing this until you kill him. That's it.\r\n\r\nThis to be aware of: After you apply WingClip there is a chance he can daze you, so be ready to fire scatter shot or use Warstomp to slow him down so you can get range. \r\n\r\nCont....","date":"2006-12-11T09:52:38-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":4,"id":13347,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Dragonfyr","body":"-----------------------\r\nDemon Name: Simone\r\nLocation: Un'Goro Crater - Normally South West of Fire Plume Ridge.\r\n\r\nPretty easy this one. There is a woman with a Felhound. \r\nMake sure you have the Stam and Int buffs again.\r\n\r\nTactics: Lay and Ice Trap, Aimed Shot the Demon (Simone), Then Concussive Shot, then ViperSting (To Silence her) and wait for the demon to get trapped in the Ice Trap. Then its pretty much about Melee again on the demon. Watch for her Lightning and try to interupt this with Scatter shot. \r\n\r\nOnce she is dead, you can get help from friends to take the demon down. This will not affect the quest.\r\n\r\nCont....","date":"2006-12-11T09:53:16-06:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":13349,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Dragonfyr","body":"-----------------------\r\nDemon Name: Solenor (Nelson the Nice)\r\nLocation: Silithus - Normally around 25,79.\r\n\r\nBring along some friends (And a Warlock) to help keep the area clean from mobs. Before you start (Around 25,79) Clear ALL the mobs from the area, this will buy you some valued time.\r\n\r\nTactics:\r\nBefore you start this demon, Get the Warlock to Duel you. Tell them to Put Curse of Recklessness on you (This will make you immune to fear). Also, take some Shadow Prot Pots, and make sure you have every buff possible :p\r\n\r\nStart: \r\nApply Hunters Mark to him. Start the fight with Arcane Shot or Multishot, When he runs towards you Hit him with WingClip (Rank3) This stuns him so he cant move. Get max range and open fire. Now beware of the beetles that will follow you around (Try to go in a Circle at all times around him when he is stuck) No need to worry about the 1st few beetles (Multishot will help to kill the beetles). Carry on with Ranged DPS until the stun breaks, he will approach you, hit him with WingClip again, maybe use Scatter Shot before he gets to you. When there is allot of Beetles Wait until they are all together and Fire Volley onto them right after getting into ranged position. They have relatively low life and are easy to kill.

Start off with a Aimedshot then use SerpantSting on him, SerpantSting will stack and cause allot of dmg to him, (this is how he dies). Start at the top of the hill and Run down it, when you get to the bottom, take a right and run on the left side of Everlook (The Town) By then you should be dead.

Make sure you have Stam / Int buffs. And take along a few mana pots and healing pots. If you loose all your mana you going to fail this quest!<br /><br />Now there is a couple of ways you can do this, most people recommend Kiting him, although I don't. If you kite you run the risk of bumping into other players or mobs. Which will make life a bit hard.<br /><br />Ok, Tactics.<br />Every 15 Seconds Klifran goes into a State of Frenzy Where he will deal allot of dmg. Use Scorpid Sting ( Highest Rank ) - This will take away his Frenzy once fired at him. (Check buffs) Do NOT Fire this before 15 seconds after the 1st Frenzy other wise it wont work. Once Applied he will deal 1 dmg every hit for the next 15 seconds.<br /><br />So 1st, As you walk up to him, Fire Scorpid Sting (And make sure it hits), then go melee on him, try not to use all of your mana because you will need it. Try to count to about 10 - 13 seconds after you fired the 1st shot then when you get to 10 - 13 seconds hit him with wingclip and get away from him, this will slow him down and give you enough time to get range.<br /><br />Once at range, Fire the next Scorpid Sting then repeat what you just did. Keep doing this until you kill him. That's it.<br /><br />This to be aware of: After you apply WingClip there is a chance he can daze you, so be ready to fire scatter shot or use Warstomp to slow him down so you can get range. <br /><br />Cont....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dragonfyr</b></h3>-----------------------<br />Demon Name: Simone<br />Location: Un'Goro Crater - Normally South West of Fire Plume Ridge.<br /><br />Pretty easy this one. There is a woman with a Felhound. <br />Make sure you have the Stam and Int buffs again.<br /><br />Tactics: Lay and Ice Trap, Aimed Shot the Demon (Simone), Then Concussive Shot, then ViperSting (To Silence her) and wait for the demon to get trapped in the Ice Trap. Then its pretty much about Melee again on the demon. Watch for her Lightning and try to interupt this with Scatter shot. <br /><br />Once she is dead, you can get help from friends to take the demon down. This will not affect the quest.<br /><br />Cont....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dragonfyr</b></h3>-----------------------<br />Demon Name: Solenor (Nelson the Nice)<br />Location: Silithus - Normally around 25,79.<br /><br />Bring along some friends (And a Warlock) to help keep the area clean from mobs. Before you start (Around 25,79) Clear ALL the mobs from the area, this will buy you some valued time.<br /><br />Tactics:<br />Before you start this demon, Get the Warlock to Duel you. Tell them to Put Curse of Recklessness on you (This will make you immune to fear). Also, take some Shadow Prot Pots, and make sure you have every buff possible :p<br /><br />Start: <br />Apply Hunters Mark to him. Start the fight with Arcane Shot or Multishot, When he runs towards you Hit him with WingClip (Rank3) This stuns him so he cant move. Get max range and open fire. Now beware of the beetles that will follow you around (Try to go in a Circle at all times around him when he is stuck) No need to worry about the 1st few beetles (Multishot will help to kill the beetles). Carry on with Ranged DPS until the stun breaks, he will approach you, hit him with WingClip again, maybe use Scatter Shot before he gets to you. When there is allot of Beetles Wait until they are all together and Fire Volley onto them right after getting into ranged position. They have relatively low life and are easy to kill. Although they will cause allot of dmg to you. and stun you. <br /><br />Cont....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dragonfyr</b></h3>-----------------------<br />Demon Name: Artorius<br />Location: Winterspring - Start the Kite at 58,12, Then go South.<br /><br />This is a simple Kite, Take along some friends (On lvl 60+ Mounts) to take away agro in your path.<br /><br />Tactics:<br />Basically, keep this guy at max range ALL THE TIME. Start off with a Aimedshot then use SerpantSting on him, SerpantSting will stack and cause allot of dmg to him, (this is how he dies). Start at the top of the hill and Run down it, when you get to the bottom, take a right and run on the left side of Everlook (The Town) By then you should be dead. If not keep kiting.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Hope this helps, and as someone has already said, you can go to <a href="http://www.tkasomething.com/avatarfaq.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tkasomething.com/avatarfaq.php</a> &lt; This will give an in-depth lesson on how to take these Demons down.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Good Luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vayn001</b></h3>With the new patch talents, it makes the quest a lot easier for marksman spec hunters. Your dps is increased majorly if you spec the correct way, thus making the demons a lot easier to kill. As he said though, bring pots and whatever buffs you can. The sooner you finish the quest, the sooner you get your wonderful weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8512</b></h3>A little-known fact - after you spawn any of the demons, you can be partied with another hunter, let THAT hunter kill the demon for you while you don't touch it, and if you have loot on Free For All, you can still loot the head (not sure if you can loot multiple heads)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok...every since this new patch it always drops in Domos Chest...Domos is the boss be4 the last boss...Ragnaros..when u get the leaf u gtg to felwood and u get 3 quests..1 quest tells you have to go to Burning Steppes, Winterspring, Un'Goro, and Silithus and kill 4 demons solo..if aggro goes off of u they de-spawn and u have to start over. Then you must get a Mature Black Dragon Sinew off of Onyxia then when u are finished with the 3 quests u turn them in and u get the staff and the bow...the staff and bow are badass, they look AMAZING and they hurt to any1 who takes a hit with it...staff or bow...<br /><br />if you would like to see a guide go <a href="https://www.tkasomething.com" rel="nofollow">www.tkasomething.com</a> and look at Guides and Look at the Hunt For Rhok'Delar guide...something all hunters should read and get motivated :)<br /><br />o and to the person that said Domos is easy...i find that hes even harder than ragnaros due to all of his adds soo u dont know what yur talking about...have fun and good luck hunters...<br /><br />Aluren - 60 NE HUNTER - Arthas</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1) It's one leaf that drops.&nbsp; Either this or the priest epic drops in each week, so it's a 50% chance.&nbsp; So it might take a few weeks to get it, even once you're up to Domo.<br /><br />2) To complete the quest you also need Mature Black Dragon Sinew from Onyxia, which has an erratic drop rate.<br /><br />3) There is a related epic quiver that you need Mature Blue Dragon Sinew from Azuregos for.&nbsp; You need the leaf to turn in the sinew.<br /><br />4) There isn't a gun reward.&nbsp; At least you *have* an epic weapon quest.&nbsp; This isn't an issue of fairness or anything, it's just the design time is better spent elsewhere.<br /><br />5) Like all items that swap from one form to another, enchants are lost when you do so, and I think the item repairs itself as well.<br /><br />6) It drops off of Majordomo's cache.&nbsp; He's the 9th boss in Molten Core, the second to last (before Ragnaros) and the second hardest (after Ragnaros).&nbsp; Lucifron is the first boss in Molten Core.&nbsp; The &quot;Gateway&quot; bosses that people take a couple weeks to kill in MC are usually Lucifron, Magdamar, Geddon, and Majordomo, then you take a few weeks to kill Ragnaros, though this varies per guild and class setup.&nbsp; With my guild's&nbsp; initial lack of warlocks it was Luci, Mag, Garr, and the dreaded &quot;Stupid Buggy Instance Porting Us Out or Not Spawning Rag Again&quot; bosses.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since you're killing rock-hard demons for this quest, it would prolly be a good idea to get demonslayer enchants on your melee weps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1/ this bow isn't easy to get by any stretch of imagination.&nbsp; <br /><br />2/ there are better bows and guns in game, so please no more &quot;it's not fair on dwarves!&quot;&nbsp; Go and get a better gun and give me the bow.<br /><br />3/ drop rate is 50% on Domo, a very tactically challenging boss.&nbsp; If you want practice, try the bloodlord in ZG.&nbsp; As that requires placement and fire control, except this has 8 adds.&nbsp; The leaf only gives you the staff.&nbsp; The bow takes the Onyxia drop which is averaging at 1 in 9 runs.&nbsp; so lol lol good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if ur not there for the majordomo kill and ur in the raid but not in the instance, and say that it dropped, and u wanted it. can u go inside the isntance and get a summon? would u be able to loot it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Winterspring demon was made to be killed by serpent sting -_-;. And &quot;yes&quot; serpent sting does stack. Well atleast on this boss. When it stacks it does about 800-900 damage a second. Thats the key to winning the fight. -_-;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'll give all hunters a big tip:<br /><br />SAVE YOU DKPs for this Ancient Petrified Leaf - <br />When it drops in MC - spend enough DKPs to get this leaf. Complete this quest. This may take a long, long time, but it is worth it!<br /><br />Rhok'Delar and Lok'Delar &lt;3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After 2hunters its my turn for it now and im waiting more then 7 WEEKS now because that stupid domo dropped 7 times Eye of divinity in a row ZOMG :'(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lot s of pple on forums say that the winter one is easy... &quot;Just kite him&quot; &quot;just use dot + lvl 1 arcane shot&quot; !<br /><br />I tryed this demon maybe 10 times. He bugged 2 times on the road when he was almost dead, 1 time 1 horde hunter drop a trap between me and the demon (GG!), and most of the 7 other try we were 2-3 hunters waiting for him. &amp; i was stressed due to the fact that i will not be allowed to try it again if i die due to the long hunters queue, and he killed me each with the &quot;malediction&quot; ...<br /><br />I m not good with it but i ve only saw 1 hunter killing him since i ve started this ! So i ll be very please to read more strategy about this one like good move, more tips etc... and not only &quot;Dot + arcane rank 1&quot; ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is it true that you get both the staff AND the bow upon the completion of the quest?<br /><br />Edit: to confirm, you DO get both the staff and the bow (and the pouch if you so desire) for this quest. YOu can no longer transform the bow and the staff, you just get both.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For hunters who doesn t have much money - time and patience for this quest :<br /><br />1) Having someone like a priest during all your attempts is a very very good thing.<br />- If u die, he rez quickly and heal and u go quickly again (more attempts, more trainning, more xp, = u ll down the demon faster.<br />- if u die, he rez, and by this way u can allways have a look on your demon and no more loose 3 hours because of a randomly noob who was trying to shot him.<br />- if u take the Winter demon malediction, u can FD, the priest clean u heal u and you will not die (very good for the repair bill) <br /><br />2) Winter demon : <br />X 1 Aspect of the Chetaah buff<br />X 1 mana potion (medium or big one depend of your mana gears, and how u spam the shots.<br />End.<br /><br />3) Silithus demon : <br />X 1 Aspect of the Hk.<br />X 2 Shadow pots (big one)<br />All sort of healling things are welcome <br />- (Major Healling pots, H.S Ungoro crystals, bandages etc...). <br />X 1 Shadow buff from your dear priest (before the fight)<br />-------------<br />Cheat : Open duel with a lock before the fight and ask him to cast curse of w on you.. u will not be feared during the next 2 minutes.<br />-------------<br />Tips : If u have some shadow gears take them too.<br />U can also have Exlxir of demon slaying / mongoose / agility / armor / etc.. but you can do it without them too..<br />End.<br /><br />4) Ungoro demon : <br />X 1 Aspect of the Wd<br />X 1 Nature pot (big one to be sure).<br />X 1 Heal potion (big one)<br />It s enough...<br />-------------<br />Now if your gears are still green / blue or if your attack power is low or others troubles...<br />X 1 elixir of the Moongose<br />X 1 elixir of demonslaying can help.<br />X 1 Armor pot / stamina buff etc... too<br />There is a thing who can slept the ad during the fight but i forgot it, anyway you can tank it easily.<br />End.<br /><br />5) B. Steppes demon :<br />X 1 Aspect of the monkey<br />X 2 Mana pots (bigs)<br />it s enough and maybe too much.<br />-------------<br />As usual having Elixir of demonslaying / mongoose / healing pots etc is good... but if u do the good things it s easy to &quot;perfect&quot; this one.<br />End.<br /><br />That was just a little list of things. I guess that they&nbsp; are good to know. This topic is not a strategy guid for demon kill... newcomers will have to read more about the fight itself. <br />i hope that it will help ;P<br /><br />Have fun !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>WOOT! Got mine last night. Finally. :) That Eye has dropped 25 times, meanwhile the Leaf has dropped three.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Zeeper, the chest despawns in 5 mins. You will only get the chest the first time you kill Domo. (You must kill Domo to spawn Rag... so if you don't get Rag the first time, you will have to kill Domo again. No loot the second time.) <br /><br />The great thing about it being a chest is that you can camp hunters that dont have it outside the instance... once it drops, you can log over to the leafless hunter, and summon them in. They do not need to be there for the kill, but they will need to be summoned in and loot it before it despawns in 5 mins. (So camp hunters at the entrance.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have a question,<br />I heard that this leaf drops 50/50 with the Eye of Divinity or w/e it's called but from other people I've heard that it drops 20% of the time.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I heard this starts the epic hunter quest.<br /><br />supposedly you gave to solo a demon in 4 different areas to make a epic bow and epic quiver.<br /><br />Also to make things more fun if another person assists you or attacks/debuffs the demon it dissapears meaning you have to start again. Included is your pet so you will have to kite/melee the demons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this begin a quest, where u will recive epic bow and stave... u also need the back mature dragon sinew from Onyxia...<br /><br />after u got those 2 things, u need to kill 4 demons... and then you'll get the bow and stave.. <br /><br />if u want the quiver, u need to either grind in winterspring or kill azeuergos in azshara... he got 100% drop chance on blue mature dragon sinew..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just wondered.. that epic hunter quest.. does it start from this Leaf? And I never heard about an epic quiver.. u might mean the Epic Bow of the Ancient keepers?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, since the patch, where does this drop? The website says that Majordomo's cache doesn't contain it.
