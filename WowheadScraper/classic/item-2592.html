These things can be found in large quantity from low level mobs. From my experience can sell for up to 1g per stack. Not too good for making money though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8271</b></h3>I disagree with buliwyf. Here is the fastest way to get tons of wool. Especially when you are 15+.<br /><br />1: Get a level 40-60 friend or guild member.<br /><br />2: Go to Deadmines (must be level 17-24)<br /><br />3: When inside change the loot to Free for All.<br /><br />4: When inside Instance loot everything (even the miners they drop most of the wool)<br /><br />5: When you are at the ship do not go under the Bridge that links up.<br /><br />6: Make sure the 60 is satisfied (give him a tip!)<br /><br />That is the way of getting tons of Wool (and Linen Cloth). At the end of each run you should get 80 pieces of Wool.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8409</b></h3>Although deadmines sometimes drops wool, usually it drops linen cloth for the majority of it. Id recommend someplace like Shadowfang Keep or purely finding wild mobs and just grind them. If you find a wild mob that drops wool, just continue killing them until the desired mount is attained. When you are in a group in an instance all the loot is shared. So if you dont have a higher leveled friend.... the best way is to just grind mobs outside.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9545</b></h3>This seems to be a very popular cloth. It always seem to run in short supply thus making it almost as expensive as Silk Cloth when stacks are available at the AH on my server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In my experience, it seems that the most productive place to farm wool is DM..

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is a quest given west of XR for Horde characters called 'Counter attack'.&nbsp; Basically what happens is, when you get the quest, a bunch of Kolkar Centaurs attack the place.&nbsp; There are a bunch of horde defenders that start attacking the centaurs.&nbsp; Just help the defenders and loot the bodies, but make sure not to grab the flag that the quest is after (it's pretty obvious... sticking out of the ground as an object, not on the body).&nbsp; After a little while, the Kolkar will retreat.&nbsp; Then just go back up to the quest giver and ask him where they are and they'll attack again.&nbsp; The drop rate's not that great, but the sheer number of them, and the fact that you have help from the 'horde defenders' (who keep coming back even if they're killed dozens of times) makes up for that.&nbsp; I got 30 linen cloths and 15 wool in about 10 minutes.&nbsp; If you appreciate this comment, feel free to donate wool cloth to Zath on the Llane server. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Usually for wool, I go to Darkshore and the furblog camps in Cliffspring falls/river has the best wool... the drops I believe are almost all the loot and some copper they're levels 16+ i believe.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>best place is definately thistlefurs in ashenvale.&nbsp; i got 140 wool cloth in a little over and hour and did i mention my spec is resto?&nbsp; so if you can dps at all you'll one shot them and likely get even more wool.&nbsp; also got 13 greens and the full set of pages to the shredder opperating manual in the process.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a 52 (fire) mage and If I need wool I just go to The Stockades, I get about 30-50 Wool each run, and 1 run takes like 15 min.<br />Hope this help :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Farmed 200 Wool (10 stacks) in 2 hours (100/hr) from the Foulweald in southern Ashenvale. Used a 54 Mage. Also collected 3 stacks of Linen and 1 stack of Silk as well as tons of grays and a few greens. No downtime whatsoever except brief travels between the two main camps. Only downside was having to destroy the many pages that ate up inventory space.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've found that a decent place to hunt for wool for lowbies is up near the mine in the northeast corner of the Barrens. The level 18-20 Venture Co. employees around there have a decent chance to drop quite a bit of wool for a lower leveled character.<br /><br />After you advance a little, the best place (period) to farm wool on Horde side is around Thistlefur Hold. I worked up 100 pieces on my level 31 arcane mage in just under 2 hours. Bring food that can keep you well fed, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Depending on your level, you can farm the Deadmines for wool. All of the mobs there drop wool or linen. You can always sell the linen for money to buy more wool. This is what I did. I recommend being quite high in lvl for this, to make it quick and worth your time if you are soloing. Also the green drops are plentiful. Always a bonus.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What are the top 3?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was farming for wool one day... (not the thing most people do, but I'm extremely optimistic about my tradeskills so I do it anyway.), and I was farming the Rot Hides of Fenris Isle (Silverpine Forest). They're supposed to drop it about 20% of the time, but I killed about 20 and only got 2... Am I just really unlucky?<br /><br />EDIT: I meant to put periods in the subject. And I wish you could order these by drop rate. Maybe I'll mention that in the improvement thread thing.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Jan 1 14:32:09 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah my advice is to get to at least level 22 and head to Hillsbrad and farm the farmers and Peons, it should grany adequate experiance and you get a really good drop rate.
