Now there are two places one is called SOUTHERN Savage Coast, and the other is just Savage Coast, you must be at Savage Coast to catch this fish and that is near the Grom'gol base camp (which is horde Ugh. lol) After you catch that fish Run up to darkshire and follow the road that takes you east out of town and head east through Deadwind Pass following the road to Swamp of Sorrows.\n\nMisty Reed Mahi Mahi - This one is in Swamp of Sorrows (which is East of Darkshire). It's at the very south eastern most part of the zone past the Sunken Temple of Attal'Hakkar and threw some lvl 45+ dragonkin. Now when you get all the way over here i went out into the water at the South West part and there are three islands, one of which you still stay in the Misty Reed and can fish off of without Murlocs trying to pester you. The other two islands however are just barely out of the area so make sure you are still in Misty Reed or you'll never see that fish. From here you can either die and spirit res at Graveyard near stoneard or walk here then walk south into Blasted lands where alliance can fly from Nethergarde Keep (Northeast part of map) up to Menethil harbor to venture to the other continent. Take the boat over to Theramore Isle, Dustwallow Marsh, then fly to Desolace.\n\nSar'theris Striker - This fish is in Desolace near another horde town called Shadowprey village and it's pretty far south near the zone to Feralas and west of the Gelkis clan over on that coast. After you catch this fish back track a lil past Gelkis clan area and follow the road that takes you South into Feralas.\n\nFeralas Ahi - there's a Horde town (lol horde must really like fishing or something) in the middle of Feralas which has a river running along side of it, thats Verdantis River and since i'm Alliance i just went a little way downstream and caught it.\n\nAfter you've done all that head to whichever Flight path you think is closest there is one to the east of you and to the west of you in Feralas, I went to Feathermoon Stronghold and flew back to Dustwallow Marsh, Where i went and saw Nat Pagle and completed the quest. Now i can sit back and fish all the way to 300.\n\nWell i hope this guide helped. And good luck fishing!\n\nThis was posted by Quicklet: 39 Night Elf, Hunter of Burning Blade.","date":"2006-07-06T04:34:39-05:00","rating":36,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"For the Feralas Ahi.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I spent 20 mins fishing just south of Shadowprey Village and it wasn't until I stepped into the water (all the way to the edge) that I caught the specialty fish. <br /><br />I admit that might have been a fluke, but I have 225+Big Iron+Aquadine, and it wasn't until I went into the water (not swimming) that I caught it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Rode directly out of Shadowprey to the small cove immediately south. As long as you see Sartheris Strand pop up on screen, you are in eligible waters. Caught the fish as part of a double catch while fishing a firefin snapper school.<br /><br />This is a game. You don't need a secret honeyhole, you don't need to be fishing &quot;structure&quot;, or deep spots, or points. Just get into any Sartheris Strand and catch your fish. Done in minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Been fishing for an hour now, using everyone' coors, confirmed that I'm standing in the strand, but just no luck with fish. Heading to where my alliance char got the fish, near the tower where the nagas are. I remember catching it within 5 casts there.<br /><br />I hate this quest due to the utter random drop rate of the quest fish, and there's absolutely nothing you could do to know if you're being plain unlucky, or rather the game's bugged, considering it worked for everyone else.<br /><br />At least with war efforts on, all the yellowtail will come in handy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>to quote<br />&quot;Just get into any Sartheris Strand and catch your fish.&quot;<br />I went to all the spots, and gave em each a nice long burn on a 5 minute +100 lure, started in the south, then tried the north, in the end i got it at (33,32) standing on a barrel floating by the sunken ship, had caught upwards of 50 fish up till then. Got a strong iron pole in the process!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those of you who don't use Coords, here's a simple way to do this quest:<br /><br />First you should know that to get this quest the minimum requirements is to be level 35 and at a fishing skill of 225.<br /><br />Second after you are 35 with skill 225 all you have to do is go to Nat Pagle in Dustwallow marsh, hes on a small island west of Theramore Isle.<br /><br />Third all you need to do to catch these fish is have the name of where they mention in the quest above your minimap, anywhere inside that area is fine to catch them.<br /><br />Now for the quest:<br /><br />Savage Coast Blue Sailfin - This fish needs to be caught in Stranglethorn Vale. Now there are two places one is called SOUTHERN Savage Coast, and the other is just Savage Coast, you must be at Savage Coast to catch this fish and that is near the Grom'gol base camp (which is horde Ugh. lol) After you catch that fish Run up to darkshire and follow the road that takes you east out of town and head east through Deadwind Pass following the road to Swamp of Sorrows.<br /><br />Misty Reed Mahi Mahi - This one is in Swamp of Sorrows (which is East of Darkshire). It's at the very south eastern most part of the zone past the Sunken Temple of Attal'Hakkar and threw some lvl 45+ dragonkin. Now when you get all the way over here i went out into the water at the South West part and there are three islands, one of which you still stay in the Misty Reed and can fish off of without Murlocs trying to pester you. The other two islands however are just barely out of the area so make sure you are still in Misty Reed or you'll never see that fish. From here you can either die and spirit res at Graveyard near stoneard or walk here then walk south into Blasted lands where alliance can fly from Nethergarde Keep (Northeast part of map) up to Menethil harbor to venture to the other continent. Take the boat over to Theramore Isle, Dustwallow Marsh, then fly to Desolace.<br /><br />Sar'theris Striker - This fish is in Desolace near another horde town called Shadowprey village and it's pretty far south near the zone to Feralas and west of the Gelkis clan over on that coast. After you catch this fish back track a lil past Gelkis clan area and follow the road that takes you South into Feralas.<br /><br />Feralas Ahi - there's a Horde town (lol horde must really like fishing or something) in the middle of Feralas which has a river running along side of it, thats Verdantis River and since i'm Alliance i just went a little way downstream and caught it.<br /><br />After you've done all that head to whichever Flight path you think is closest there is one to the east of you and to the west of you in Feralas, I went to Feathermoon Stronghold and flew back to Dustwallow Marsh, Where i went and saw Nat Pagle and completed the quest. Now i can sit back and fish all the way to 300.<br /><br />Well i hope this guide helped. And good luck fishing!<br /><br />This was posted by Quicklet: 39 Night Elf, Hunter of Burning Blade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just seems like bad or good luck. I got the other three with a total of about 45 fish caught. This last one I gave up on after about a half hour last night. Cleaned out my creel and came back this morning. Total today:<br />42 cod<br />8 oilys<br />10 yellowtail<br />8 firefin<br />2 iron bound trunks<br />1 sturdy locked chest<br />and finally<br />1 Sar'theris Striker<br /><br />That's 70 catches of one sort or another. would have been 10 extra skill points but of course I got no skill raises. Bleh. Last time I'll bother with fishing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this fish at 26,78 within the first minute of casting. Convenient since it was located next to a school of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Oily%20Blackmouth">Oily Blackmouth</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just wanted to say that, i caught this fish on my first try on Ranazjar Isle...my fishing lvl was 225 w/ a +5 fishing pole. No cords exactly but i dont think it matters :) happy fishing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>21,87 is good, just make sure you are in the shallow water and that you are in the strand, standing on the shore is not in the strand<br /><br />got it in less than 10 minutes</div>

Then I added Nightcrawlers, and got it on the 2nd cast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Saltbill hit it right on the money. Followed his directions to the T, I fished right in front of the mithril mine.

Freaking awesome.<br />Coordinate is 24.82 right in front of the mithril mine. <br /><br />Thanks Saltbill,,,, freaking great :)</div>

For those without cosmos, go south along the coast from Shadowprew village, then swim along the shore to a little area that dips in east. On the south side of this cove is a little area that sticks out on which you can stand.

Not far from the bottom of the hill where the path leaves the village, there is a centaur standing on a rock. Her name is Selendra. If you walk directly to the water's edge from where she is standing, you'll be in the spot I was standing when I caught this fish. It was night on the game. I was using Nat Pagler's super duper fishing rod (quest reward from the Hinterlands). I didn't use a bauble, and I got the fish on the third cast.</div>
