<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7786</b></h3>I personally think this is a useless device. December of last year, I bought around 500 snowballs and sent them to one of my grunt toons. I think he still has around 400 of them or more. I don't see why anyone would want to take the time to create one snowball every 24 hours.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this was a christmas thing .. i dont know if youc an even buy it or if it drops any more...<br /><br />it was a drop from a quest that you could only get during christmas time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so dose this thing only drop on chrismas or is it limeted supply on chrismas ? please tell me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Comm got it right at the start.<br /><br />This was from Christmastime quest. It is not available now. It does not drop. Hopefully they will bring it back this year. I think you had to be 35+ for the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>how to farm them? i think you can do the quest only 1 time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You either get it from the santa quest, or the grinch quest.<br /><br />And its SURE as hell aint worth more than 50g.. sad people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got mine for 24 silver at AH ! I've seen them go for over 200g on our server ! I'm keeping my eyes open for more !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Very good payoff for very little work, sold mine for 25g!<br /><br />the abominable greench changed my life, and he can change yours too</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sadly I did not get it form the quest but after saying wtb, once being mistunderstood for saying wts, I was able to buy it form someone for 5g, I wanted this for awhile and now that I have it I am going to have fun being the one selling the machines as opposed to being the one looking for one on the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Requires a snowball to use.This is why they are so popular,so people can be a Snowman in July!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sold it for 12g :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The chance of getting this recipe AT CHRISTMAS TIME is 0.01% - once Christmas and the special events stop, the chance of getting this recipe reduces to 0.00% (unless you buy).<br /><br />With this recipe you can make snowballs all year round, and therefore use items that require snowballs i.e Snowman, Little Helper etc.<br /><br />Very rare and very very valueable. Easily worth 500+ Gold. In fact, if you see it for 500G buy it - that is a bargain!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I bought this one at 1 g in stormscale realm :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In IRONFORGE where ALL the cute little npc's tell you to go. Speak to the man sitting on the chair infront of the bank. He looks like santa claus. He is santa. When you finish&nbsp; Stolen Winter Veil Treats you get a chance at having THIS ITEM pop out at you from the mysterious gift box you get as an end prize.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did all of the winter quests I could SEE around here, no snowmaster :( anyone know from who?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i love thot but sometimes they leave out lil details is it repeatable?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The quest isn't repeatable, maybe next year they will have something similar.&nbsp; Being once again that there will be a small chance of getting the Snowblaster.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got lucky and recieved it as a gift from father winter after doing the Stolen Treats quest.&nbsp; Now I am going to go make a large profit by selling it.&nbsp; Though would any of you say it is a better idea to hold out till after Christmas to sell it?&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The presant you get the Schematic: Snowmaster 9000 in drops different blueprints for the different item-making-professions.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After Christmas, nobody wants these things. They're all the rage during the holidays only.<br />I got the schematic last year &amp; made up several machines, I also had a toon with tons of snowballs in the bank.<br /><br />I couldn't give all that away. I ended up destroying the snowballs &amp; vendoring several machines after literally, offering them to whoever opened trade. I waited until about August this year before giving up on them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>do you know what santa gave me this year?<br /><br />5 kingsblood<br /><br />i hate u santa... i really do<br /><br />plz tell me u get the schematics from a quest he givs you...plz<br /><br />WHY?&nbsp; :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I sold one of these at 150 g on EU Stormscale. I still got another and im selling it on 120 g now. Whisper to Surma if you are intressed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol is there a certain place every year where u can get the christmas quests, if so where ?<br />please tell me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I bought a few of these schematics at Christmas time for about 75g. One I used for myself and I sold a few of the others for around 100, 125 and 175. I still have two left, but unfortunately the only offers I've been getting lately on the schem is in the 5-10g range (which is pretty stupid when you consider that I usually sell the snowmasters themselves for 10-20g).<br /><br />The thing is that people don't understand what a great money maker having the schematic is. They see the ability and they say &quot;WTF. Why would I pay over a hundred gold to get snowballs&quot;. Stupid people. The benifit to having this schem is not the snowballs , IT'S SELLING THE MACHINE FOR AN OBSCENE PROFIT. The snowmaster's mats cost about 3g, which means you make about 3x-6x the money you put in! I've actually made so much money from these machines that I could have destroyed the other five I bought and still made a profit.<br /><br />Basically what I'm trying to say is that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Sure an item might have a silly/useless ability, but people have a lot of gold nowadays (especially on older servers, I'm on Kil'Jaeden), and they'll pay through the nose even for a novelty item such as the snowmaster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is there a way to get this other than the christmas quets?</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
