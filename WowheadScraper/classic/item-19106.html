The reward\/effort ratio is simply stupidly good. I just shot a few ineffective gun shots at Korrak (less than 600 damage throughout the fight, woo!) while 10 or so people from my raid group of closer-to-60s did the work. Spent less than 30 minutes in the battleground, all in all.\n\nI'm all for rewarding PvP & the tasks from the BGs and so on, but rewards should preferably correspond to effort. Here I twiddle my thumbs for a few minutes whilst at the right location and presto! I'm about as well-armed as a Warrior who spent days, even weeks, on getting himself a Doomsaw or Reaper. Maybe not precisely unfair - I'm following the rules of the game as they are, after all - but not terribly consistent and not very well thought-out.\n\nAt least making Korrak a challenge to take out, instead of a cakewalk for a handful of players who know what kiting is and how to do it, seems prudent. On the other hand, I've already abused his simplicity so me complaining is perhaps a tad hypocritical.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Caffi</b></h3>To get this, you need to travel to Southshore and accept the quest from the female dwarf outside the cave to AV named &quot;Prospector Stonehewer&quot;, she is on the east side of the entrace, outside the tent.<br /><br />The quest does not say what the reward is, but after you win a game, (just being in the game when it is won is enough) you can go back to the dwarf and get your Ice Barbed Spear.<br /><br />This quest has 4 weapons to choose from:<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19107">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19107</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19106">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19106</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19108">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19108</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20648">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20648</a><br /><br />(If you dont need any of the weapons, choose this polearm anyway, it sells to vendor for 7 gold 33 silver 53 copper)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7121</b></h3>For a warrior, the best weapon pre MC, and ZG, thats blue of course. Great top end damage, and the stats would be good for a hunter as well.. of course.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3>Amazing hunter weapon, probably the best available weapon for a hunter until you hit level 60. Put 25 agility enchant on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6934</b></h3>Got this at 51 on my warrior, used it well into 60. With the new warrior talents (pole/axe 5% to crit all for the same 5 points) this item will be even more valuable. I suggest everyone get this as soon as possible unless as you level up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mawx</b></h3>This is quite the weapon for nearly all melee classes due to its high stat boosts and it has a high dmg range aswell so you can do some nice criticals :)<br />Easy to obtain aswell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7968</b></h3>As many above have said. This is by far one of the better weapons in the game. It can be very useful in ZG/MC and yet still amazingly obtainable at level 51, and the only thing you have to do is win a game of AV! Great for Hunters, or Warriors and Paladins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7901</b></h3>This is by far the greatest pre 60, and even 60 blues that are availiable. Not only will it give a melee class such as a warrior a great boost in their overall damage, for classes such as hunters and such who don't have twin dawn's edge's it provides a healthy amount of agi and great stats overall.<br /><br />Easily obtainable at 51, all you have to do is win a AV.<br />Obtain the quest just outside the AV entrance in Hillsbrad Foothills. Alliance entrance is straight North of Southshore.<br />Horde Entrance is straight North of Tauren Mill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9525</b></h3>This is a excellent free weapon for a paladin or a hunter,it also comes with a icy blue glow.<br /><br />The best thing about this weapon is you only need to do one AV match to get it , you can obtain the quest from your factions AV entrances.<br /><br />They are located in the Hillsbrad Foothills , it is north of Southshore for the alliance and north east of Tarren Mill for the horde.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>11253</b></h3>Probably the best 2h weapon you can obtain before 60, and all you need to do is win a AV. The quest can be obtained outside the actual AV instance entrance in the Alterac Mountains.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nandoStar</b></h3>As of patch 2.0.4 the quest is a level 60 one, so you can't get this at 51 anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crazytroll</b></h3>Dinged 51 as a hunter in ZF and hearthed to org then got on zep, flew to Undercity and took a bat to tarren mill. Once there I walked just above the town to a cave where an orc gave me the quest to kill the main dwarf in AV. Entered AV got around 200 hks and killed the dwarf. Once out I turned in the quest and the orc said something along the lines of &quot; Yes, you have tasted the blood of the alliance now I will give you an extrodinary weapon of your choice!&quot; The choices were a mace (that i couldnt use),a wand (that i couldn't use), a crossbow, and the ice barb. At first I didn't know what to choose, the polearm or the crossbow. I decided to go with the polearm because the crossbow's speed was so terrible. Plus although hunter's melee is poor the +21 agility is a big help. Definently choose the polearm unless your ranged weapon is like the bow from WC or sumthin not good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>33705</b></h3>This weapon is good if you get it from 51-57 but now with TBC the rage reaver is much better for damage and stats and you can get it at 58<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=29908">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=29908</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>badget</b></h3>Sigh. I have been in AV for almost 40 times. And i have never tried to win. That is really depressing, Cause i just wanted the weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>37129</b></h3>I was very lucky and got this on my first attempt in AV, only taking about 20 minutes. I just put a +7 dmg enchant on it and I'm whoopin up! I have the feeling this one will last me until the OL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>35664</b></h3>excelent weapon for all classes that can use it. obtainable in Alterac Valley,usable till Outland weaponry</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>41983</b></h3>i used this weapon until 60 then i got blade of misfortune but if you have TBC then u can get rage reaver as ftb262 said and use that until you ding 60---hope i helped----<br />+has anyone put fiery weapon enchant on ice barbed spear+plz tell me if you have</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Windseeker</b></h3>Ok this wep is WAY better for arms warriors because you get just about the same damage with mortal strike as Rage rever but this wep has +12 strength, +20 stamina and +21 agility. rage rever only has +14 agil and +30 stamy and i dout that a tank pali or warrior is going to be using atwo hand wep so use ice babred spear untill like 61-62 then you can get a better drop in blackrock spire.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this at level 52 and I love it, on average I'm doing about 40-50 more dmg/hit than with the Executioner's Axe and it hits a bit faster. I plan on using this until I can get the Arc Reaper. As for the quest being easy, during the last patch Blizzard made Korrak a little harder to kill, before you could fear kite him until he died just doing dots and such, now you really do need a raid party to get it done. Also I had to do at least 7 BGs matches before the Alliance controlled the battle well enough for a raid group to go after Korrak without the Horde causing problems. All-in-all for a MS war like myself, seeing crits go for ~800 dmg on a leather/cloth wearer in PvP is great. Even better is a 2800 crit with full rage and execute :) Loving this polearm but still can't wait to get my Arc Reaper because it ownz.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>3 hunters took him down! lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i just got mine at 52<br />This is sad, some Horde players on the server Kil'jaeden are just complete morons.<br />Here's the situation, we've been playing for 5 hours, and we're still in the middle, we got to their base once, but were pushed back. It's close to midnight and i have an 8 o'clock class the next morning. A group decides to kill korrak (i was not a part of this group) so about 15 players go to the field of strife and kill him. We were all in one full raid group, so when they killed him EVERYONE GOT CREDIT. soon as he died, the 25 players who were fighting the alliance all STOP FIGHTING and start &amp;*!@#ing out the ppl who killed korrak. only about 10 ppl from my guild were still fighting the alliance. At that moment the Allys decide to attack en masse and decemate the horde forces, making it all the way to the frostwolf GY in about 10min. We lost the BG not because somebody killed korrak, but because a bunch of ppl made a big deal about it. It was so sad, it was almost comical. People who have this or something better are unwilling to help. Geez ppl, you aren't gonna lose an AV just becuase you take the time to kill korrak. you will make all the 51-55 players very happy. and make them more effective against higher lvl players.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>kk i just got Sul'Thraze the lasher, im a 50 Orc warrior nearly 51. I was wondering if i should drop Sul'Thraze the lasher (Epic sword) for this spear. I could use some advice and help</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>fury may be duel wield spec but when i get Enraged (when i get critted, enrage gives me 25% melee dmg increase), i get normal swing crits with IBS of 1.2k...<br /><br />so when i walk around with IBS on my back and im using things like death wish and bloodthirst, i just tell them i can still do immense damage with a 2h :P<br /><br />However my duel wielders do more dps than my 2h. Bloodrazor + crystal sword of the monkey.<br /><br />IBS is good for all warrior specs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just hit 51 today and went to AV to get this bad boy. Luckily for me, the Horde on Stormscale have it together; I had no idea what I was doing, but our team dominated and now I have IBS to show for it. <br /><br />Built Horde Tough...<br /><br /><i>Edited, May 15th 2007 9:36pm by alexbacardi</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My little Gnome got this at 52. I'm not sure what to say ... I've got a weapon about on par with a Blackhand Doomsaw a good 7 levels before I could even begin to hope to get in to a BRD raid and then it'd typically take dozens of trimes before I'd be likely to win a drop. The reward/effort ratio is simply stupidly good. I just shot a few ineffective gun shots at Korrak (less than 600 damage throughout the fight, woo!) while 10 or so people from my raid group of closer-to-60s did the work. Spent less than 30 minutes in the battleground, all in all.<br /><br />I'm all for rewarding PvP &amp; the tasks from the BGs and so on, but rewards should preferably correspond to effort. Here I twiddle my thumbs for a few minutes whilst at the right location and presto! I'm about as well-armed as a Warrior who spent days, even weeks, on getting himself a Doomsaw or Reaper. Maybe not precisely unfair - I'm following the rules of the game as they are, after all - but not terribly consistent and not very well thought-out.<br /><br />At least making Korrak a challenge to take out, instead of a cakewalk for a handful of players who know what kiting is and how to do it, seems prudent. On the other hand, I've already abused his simplicity so me complaining is perhaps a tad hypocritical. Nevertheless, I feel got this thing way too easily.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Jun 10 19:55:32 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah Arc Reaper Ownz , thats why I went weaponsmith in the first place, but in the meantime I just hit 51 and trying to get the spear in BG is like I just killed everyones mother or something. The amount of hostility from Alliance players is amazing.<br /><br /> Im not just standing around letting the horde run rampant and doing nothing. I can see people not wanting to help but the amount of verbal abuse to me just asking if anyone was going after it was amazing. <br /><br />Edited, Wed Aug 17 13:38:13 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What was Blizzard thinking? How can they offer such a great weapon for a 30 minute quest? I spent weeks saving up my gold for my arcanite reaper and now I wish I spent it on my Epic mount. <br /><br />Blizzard has done a decent job up to this point of keeping trade skills like master axesmith somewhat useful but now there will be little demand for those high priced weapons. They may as well just offer a 1-step, easy, 30 minute quest for an Epic mount and just screw all those players who saved up the 900 gold.<br /><br />I can't believe how many peeps already have it. It will be the most popular level 50+ weapon in a matter of days.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Actually, as member of the Alliance, I'm glad to see that the Horde are equally condesending about helping on this quest as the Alliance are...<br /><br />Last night on Burning Legion the alliance were pushed to their last graveyard in Dun Baldr. I started organizing a raid group to go for Korrak. All the jerks that had finished the quest or had better items refused to help. Luckily, there were a lot of cool people who helped out and we were able to finish. I can't even use any of the items given (I'm a druid). Still, I felt helping fellow alliance get their items would help everyone out in the long run.<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure about the whole which is better debate, IBS or reaper. I'm no warrior, but is the reaper really worth 800g more than a free weapon that you can get from an easy quest (provided you have ppl to help)? That's the big question. With all the epics that drop in the higher level instances, I think warriors might be better off using this thing till they can accumulate the DKP to get something better. Save your cash for an epic mount...just my honest opinion though. :)<br /><br />Edited, Fri Aug 26 15:04:34 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Heres my story: i hit 51 earlier today and enthusiastically made my way to AV but first stopping in IF to pick up my Lord Alexander's Battle Axe. when i got into the BG i had no idea what to do but picked up on it quickly. we lost our first 2 games, but the 3rd looked promising. we took the offensive early and grabbed all the GYs on the way to Drek. it looked like a landslide, but noobs kept looting drek's dogs and someone kept running out of the keep when they aggroed drek himself reseting the bastard. that happened over 10 times, we would get him to 15-20% and someone would flee, all the while the horde regrouped and pushed to kill stormpike. 6 hours of futility and stupidity i cried for the first time in 4 years at the end. if i ever find the people who kept running out i WILL DESTROY THEM!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i can get Carapace Spine X-Bow from Stratholme instead.<br />I want this polearm, i love the looks of it. Screw Blood Seeker, this has lots of AGI and STA</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The reaper is still better guys(not cost wise as a reaper is very expensive). Ok this may be a FREE blue pretty much becuase it is so easy to obtain but look at compared to the reaper for a sec here.<br /><br />Arcanite Reaper: 153-256 3.8 spd 62 attack power and 13 plus to stam<br /><br />Ice barbed Spear: 155-233 3.6 spd 21 agl 13 str 20 stam<br /><br />Ok now convert attack power to 31 str for warriors at least<br /><br />Arcanite Reaper hits for more period. that .2 seconds is wasted time if you ask me and makes the spear crit for less. Ok so damage wise would you rather can a A) Doomsaw B) Reaper. If you answered Reaper then you will like reaper over this cause doomsaw and this do about the same amount of damage per hit (Spear hits for a little more). The one thing the spear has imo is the agl plus which is really nice to boost crit chance. However that Xbow (<a href="/classic/item=19107/bloodseeker">Bloodseeker</a> that you also get from the quest gives a nice little boost as well to agl its passive with reaper. Not only that but xbow gives more str giving your reaper more damage. Reaper is better weapon. The spear is not that good for warriors if you ask me. If your lvl 51 then wow congrats on this nice weapon but if your 60 and have the cash go get a reaper or to MC and try to get the epic axe there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So, I'm a level 53 paladin, who, just earlier today, was @#$%^ing to his comrades that it was impossible to find a good weapon that didn't drop in strath or something. (At the time, I had the Warmonger, which just didn't suit me at all)<br /><br />So, I get the idea to go do Battlegrounds and gain some quick XP. Found this quest and almost creamed myself. Managed to talk a group of 12 people into taking down Korrak. He's actually very easy once you get a rythm down (actually, I'd like to extend my sincerest hatred for the RETARDS out there who were not in the raid party and kept attacking him right as we were charging him -- thus, ruining the entire battle for us) <br /><br />Just kite him. Let the hunters and makes slow him down, then come in and take pot shots at him. It's slow, but works well. <br /><br />I immediately put a crusader enchant on this badboy, and for a level 53, I think I did very, very good getting this!<br /><br />Edit: I'd just like to add that, with SoC and a raging agility stat, my best crit with this weapon so far has been over 2300. I think I could cry.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jun 27 15:24:32 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>About a week after I turned 60 (/cheer) I was on my 2nd UBRS raid with my super sexy Ice Spear in tow and low and behold the coveted Doomsaw drops. Basicly everyone compared their wepons to the doomsaw and long story short we did a (gulp) GREED ROLL for it. That probibly would not have happened before this rediculouly easy to obtain very kick butt polarm. I am a hunter and I passed on the Xbow reward just because I knew that there are several very similar bows, guns and xbows out there that are fairly common drops. I was still using my Verdent Keepers aim for Mar Princess run untill I got the Carapace Spine Crossbow a week later. Pacience pays off because you will not get such a sexy and FREE 2 hander that just requires 30 minutes in BG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Many warriors think this weapon is almost equal to the Arcanite Reaper, since the stats look good and I was of the same opinion for a long time.<br />But one day, I had nothing to do, so I spent my time farming arcanite for an Arcanite Reaper. After a week (I spent lots of time in Alterac Valley) I had all the mats and I whispered a blacksmith who could make it.<br />After some time improving my 2h axe skill up to 300, I discovered it's power. It's really amazing, and this item is just lousy crap compared to it. I think, the Arcanite Reaper was worth getting, and you can easily do some serious damage with it, like 1200 crits on cloth or leather wearers, and up to 2000 with 20 points in fury.<br />This weapon is still very nice, used it for a long time, so if you've lots of stuff to do, and if you don't have much time, get it, until you can afford an Arcanite Reaper or find another nice weapon in MC.<br /><br />And btw, nice hunter wep.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Jul 30 08:58:22 2005</div>

These two alone means he's an easy win.<br /><br />We had hunters pull him to the graveyard, and took him out (with minimal effort) with a raid of less than 10. The rogues would stun him whenever possible, I (a level 51 warrior at the time) would hit him a few times, and stand at a fair distance away, in case everyone dies so he won't deaggro. A level 60 warrior to tank would also be nice. The guards will help keep the Alliance (or Horde, if you prefer) at bay.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this isn't a reaper replacer and reaper does not cost 900g.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can very well understand the frustration of warriors that have spent so much time and effort in getting enough cash for an arcanite reaper (even tho it is still better, the Ice Barbed Spear is soo easy to get for FREE). What I do not understand tho is why like 80% of the horde (that already got the Ice Barbed Spear &lt;---( with help of others as well ) are often NOT WILLING to help other horde players (same team!) to get this weapon. It really looks like as soon as someone got it they do not want others to get it as well (grudging). Why is it soooooo problematic if a level 51-55 is trying to get this weapon and asking for help? Ofcourse people would like to have this as soon as they can, you would (or maybe did) to if you where that level and had the possibility to get it. I can get so irritated of these greedy (only for themselves) people...<br /><br />YES IT IS MAYBE TO EASY TO GET COMPARED TO ARCANITE REAPER, BUT IT IS LIKE IT IS, SO LIVE WITH IT, AND BE HELPFULL NOW AND THEN!<br /><br />I have tried getting it for like 7 battlegrounds now, most of the time if I ask for help people will start cursing at me..... It seems to be a trend to do this. Do helpfull (non greedy) people still excist?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AoBman05</b></h3>IBS is basically Whirlwind Axe 2.0 for Lv50 Warriors (and Paladins), assuming you get it right at Lv51. It's quite OP for the last 9 levels since the weapon is on par with endgame level blues. <br /><br />I highly recommend it since the mace is more caster oriented, and you won't get much out of the crossbow. You won't need a new 2H'der until Lv60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>longdongwarrior</b></h3>If you are a warrior you have some choices. Consider using Thrash Blade and Assassination Blade (10-25g depending on server). For two handers, consider Lord Alexander's Battleaxe.<br /><br />Get Bloodseeker - depending on your gear this crossbow can be comparable to Strikers Mark from MC. You will use this FAR into 60. This polearm, you will not.</div>
