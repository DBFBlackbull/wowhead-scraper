<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Best place I've found for Horde to catch Firefin and Oily Blackmouth is at the Zoram'gar Outpost on the Western edge of Ashenvale. I've gotten 6 in a row of both types here at times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So one day I was bored and actually wanted to see how often I could catch firefins and blackmouths...&nbsp; So here is what I caught after 20 minutes of fishing on the Menethil docks:<br /><br />29% - Blackmouths: 12<br />9% - Firefins: 4<br />62% - Other: 26<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total Fish: 42<br /><br />This was with my fishing level effectively around 170<br />(skill was 120 + nightcrawlers)<br /><br />So unless someone knows of a better place for firefins, I'd say it'll take you quite a while to make significant amounts of fire oil.<br /><br />Just as a side-note, Oily Blackmouths were going for about 2 gold per 10 when I checked the AH.&nbsp; Which means if I sat there and fished for an hour or so I could make a nice round 10 gold between the firefins and the blackmouths.<br /><br />Just my 2 Copper<br /><br /><i>I wish you could fish with polearms...</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In Menethil Harbor, between Deepwater Tavern and the old Osprey shipwreck (the shipwreck a bit southeast on the map) ... I found a school of Firefin snapper.<br /><br />I was working on the Morbent Fel quest for the ingots and saw a school of red fish swimming around.<br /><br />As soon as I saw it, I jumped on shore, equipped my rod and fished away.&nbsp; I must have gotten 8 or 9 Firefin Snappers before the school eventually left.<br /><br />One way to see the school from above the water is there will be a circle on the top of the water ... sort of like a disturbance of something swimming beneath it.&nbsp; That's a good marker to look for.&nbsp; Try to get your bobber to land in or around the circle for best catching results!<br /><br />There were also several schools of Oily Blackmouth fish around the other shipwrecks in the area too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With 1.9, you can now find schools of Firefin Snappers in Cragpool Lake west of the loggers in Stonetalon Mountains.&nbsp; But... it's not just a school of fish, it's an &quot;oil spill&quot;, complete with a black goo and a barrel floating in it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can catch them both off the docks in southshore at level 65 without needing any further +'s with bait.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I really don't have a difficult time when I look for these. The best place for me thus far is on the coast in Shadowprey Village. When ever I get there is about 3 schools&nbsp; floating around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>WHenever I need some snappers, or some money I always take my Horse to Dustwhallow Marsh. Start at the graveyard near Theramore, and walk along the beach till Ratchet. Many spots there, and almost no competition, like in STV</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>300/300 Spec<br /><br />I don't know if it's any different on your servers... but my little secret sweet spot for Finefins and Blackmouths are in Desolace.&nbsp; If you just run the coast at Shadowprey Village (horde) then when your done farming there... go north to the next open coast line.. there's about 5 or 6 more schools there.<br /><br />By the time you're done farming one area, you can go back to the other and it's replinished!<br /><br />Happy Fishing!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Have fished for firefin and oily in several places. Without doubt, the docks in Menethil is the best....I took 3 toons from under 140 to 225 here, and the oily came roughly 1` in 3 catches, and the firefin came roughly 1 for each 2 oily caught.

I found that on the Eastern Strand there were lots of Firefin Snapper schools while on the Wesetern Strand there were lots of Oily Blackmouth schools. You guys should try it out, I hope it works as well for you as it did for me. Happy fishing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It appears that if one fishes near the naga on the beach at southshore, you can fish up one every ten minutes, or every fifteen or so fish, I was there for two hours and came away with 4 of them, enough to make 1 potion of Firepower... Hmmm I guess I'll have to try Booty Bay</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>something strange happens with their drop rate (or it's totally random ofc). I fished tons on the dock of horde village in Desolace while doing my 225+ fishing q. I mean 15+ of each in less than 2 hrs and thinking I got the perfect spot I went back again some day later only to get 2-3 in 30 mins... They're pretty thin in AH and when they do appear they cost a lot...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Awesome place to fish for these is in Windshear crag in the Blackwolf River and Cragpool Lake.<br /><br />I was there during peak hours on a weekend and fished for these uninterrupted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you go to the very north-eastern tip of Darkshore, you will come to the edge of the Veiled Sea. I had to swim to get to this point. I started fishing from a rock outcroping just past the deep water(when your swimming, you'll see what I'm talking about) with a fishing skill of 110 and no lure. I caught 3 firefins in the first 10 minutes, but no more untill I reached skill lvl 125 where I caught another 4 in 10 minutes. After that I was able to catch one more for about every 8 - 10 minutes of fishing. In total I caught 11 firefins and 5 oily blackscales in 45 minutes time.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Mar 22 03:32:28 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Booty Bay is by far the best place to catch them. In about 2 hours fishing with a 225 skill and +100 lure I caught 17 of them and another 10 Oily Blackmouths. These fish went for a lot in the AH, too.</div>
