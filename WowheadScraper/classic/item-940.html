<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it seems like my server is a little different than those other servers, because you can find this thing&nbsp; for sale, it's been on AH twice in past two weeks by two sellers (first with 250BO and second with 300BO).&nbsp; People on our server are crazy spenders, so people are more inclined to put thins like this on AH (it would be a lot harder to convince yourself to keep it or give it to a friend if you know you can get 250g instead 100g which is what it goes for on other servers.&nbsp; Anyway I got at level 43 for 120g from a guild mate, which is a lot, but it's a good deal, I'll be wearing it for 10 levels at least.&nbsp; It might be 14 or even 17 levels before I find (or can buy at a reasonable price) something that is actually any better. The advantage it gives to a level 42-50 player is amazing, and at level 53-59 it qualifies as at least decent cloth chest armor.<br /><br />I think it looks fine on undead priest, although I wish it weren't bright green.&nbsp; It's the kind of garb you'd see a highly esteemed dignitary wearing; I guess you could say ostentatious.&nbsp; So I just made a nice Shadoweave robe/set for prancing around org, to look cool instead of ridiculous.&nbsp; Problem solved.<br /><br />The 500 mana comes in handy, you can use it in a big battle when almost out of mana (and it looks like everyone will get wiped) before a great heal on whoever has the best chance of surviving/slaying whoever it is you're fighting.&nbsp; Or just use it when you think one extra big heal (on the group or an individual) will save a life (or several lives).&nbsp; In soloing, just use it when casting your buff (AI/PWF) on yourself and you barely put a dent in your mana percentage or just save it for just in case.&nbsp; Mages/warlocks might have more, and better, uses for it since they have higher mana consuming damage spells.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Epic items like these are random world drops, no one cares where you got yours from. I am amazed at how many people are posting about where they got it from and how it looks. Is this worth 275g? What level did you wear it till, and what did you replace it with, thanks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes, world drop means it could drop anywhere from a mob lvl 40+. So farming for it isn't really going to work, you just need a lot of luck!<br /><br />A mate in my guild gave this robe to me yesterday as he found it in Tanaris. That's right...'gave it'...as he felt it would be of way better use for a lvl 46 priest then a warrior. <br />I was in total shock as I got it...the robe doesn't just look amazing on a female NE priest...the stats in itself are totally GREAT, not to mention the 'free mana' it gives from time to time. I'm sure my priest will be wearing it for a long time to come if not all the way up to lvl 60!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i bought this robe 75 gold from ah for my mage:) thats cheap<br /><br />60 warrior sergeras (blood and honor)<br /><br />45 mage sergeras (blood and honor)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I saw this on the AH cheap and debated whether I should buy it. In the end, obviously I did and I am extremely happy with it. The int and spirit bonuses are magnificent, but I have used the -500 mana special on bosses and emergencies so many times I have lost count. Basically this gives you a free spell for every boss fight or when an unexpected patrol ambushes you. In my opinion, this is the best robe you can get until the mid to high 50's depending upon your luck with drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this drop off a Yeti of all things.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is quite a good robe. It has a better int bonus than most robes until 60. I really don't think any class would need this other than a mage. Why a druid would need it is past me. Locks don't need spirit, and the lack of stamina makes this useless to them. Priests can use it, but would be better off with something giving alot more spirit. Now I don't understand why everyone is posting these ridiculous prices, half of which are most likely lies. And if you see a BoE epic, what would you do? Most of you idiots would need it, like that apparent resto druid and feral druid. On andorhol this goes 100-150g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm pretty sure this is new after 1.10 but now on the female models for this robe the side patches near the hips are a light purple/lavendar sort of color, instead of the grey that it was before. <br /><br />I can also confirm that pre 1.10 the Use: on this item was not working. <br /><br />Now, when you use the item you get a 10 second buff called &quot;insight&quot;. <br /><br />Edit: they're not purple on the side, they're see through so they show whatever leggings you're wearing.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes, world drop means it could drop anywhere from a mob lvl 40+. So farming for it isn't really going to work, you just need a lot of luck!<br /><br />A mate in my guild gave this robe to me yesterday as he found it in Tanaris. That's right...'gave it'...as he felt it would be of way better use for a lvl 46 priest then a warrior. <br />I was in total shock as I got it...the robe doesn't just look amazing on a female NE priest...the stats in itself are totally GREAT, not to mention the 'free mana' it gives from time to time. I'm sure my priest will be wearing it for a long time to come if not all the way up to lvl 60!</div>

Definitely not worth 150-200G, as there are much, much better ones out there. Excellent robes for priests though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>celwinne</b></h3>Interesting bug with this item. If you try the following steps:<br /><br />1. As druid, activate the mana cost reduction.<br />2. Shapeshift to cat and back.<br />3. Use rejuvenation on self.<br /><br />If you check your mana costs after this, they should be crazy high.
