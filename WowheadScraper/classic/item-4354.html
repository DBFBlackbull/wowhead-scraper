<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've seen this on the AH once... But it was going for an insane amount of money.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>found it on a level 41 scorpion in Tannaris, i know that it isnt listed as a mob that it drops off, I must have just gotten lucky, oh and it was the first mob i killed today also. guild says that it goes for around 200-250 gold on my server, Argent Dawn, alliance, if you are interested, message Korris.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can you believe i picked one of these up from a kobold miner in Arathi! Mind due to the server I'm on (relatively new one) I doubt I'll sell it for much :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Did anybody ever find this one? :( It's never on the Ah and can't find it :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got mine for 50g a couple months or so ago. I've made a pretty good profit so far selling the shirts. Started at 5g buyouts and they were selling fast, raised it a couple times and now I sell them for 7.5g each.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow, the most expensive shirt pattern for what? a shirt with no stats! hmmmmmm... can we say GIPPED! I knew you could!...The Dark Silk shirt is much better looking with the red thrills on the sleeves, so for looks, this shirt isn't better, perhaps the same. I can sell Dark Silk shirts for 2g buyout, but if I had this pattern, I would have to compete with 3 others selling Rich Purple shirts for 1.5-2g buyout. No thx. Heh, and I'm certainly not paying 50-100g for the pattern. Maybe ill pick it up for 5-10g which is a better representation of Price vs rarity vs &quot;non-useful, but looks nice&quot; item!</div>

He was a Warlock so I travelled across quickly and entered the instance. He summoned me, we killed Herod. It wasn't all altruistic, I went in hopes of getting the 'Scarlet Tabard'. <br /><br />As I was just wandering around after I killed him I saw a treasure chest with my treasure finding racial. I opened the chest and ...voila. I quickly googled the recipe and then I realised the worth and value of the item. I dithered whether to sell it for 200+ gold but then I realized WoW gold is just WoW gold. I ended up learning the recipe and made a couple for some of my friends on the server. <br /><br />Happy to be one of the designer tailors on WoW Classic Kurinaxx! <br /><br />-Durin aka Tom Ford in Kurinaxx.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Savistik</b></h3>Due to the existence of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=215415">Waylaid Supplies: Rich Purple Silk Shirts</a> in SoD, this pattern is current in the Wild Growth AH for 303g bid/404g buyout.<br /><br />Not complaining, just saying don't put this up on the AH for 50s like the old days. Someone will make a mint flipping.</div>
