The farmers make real money by exchanging dollars for virtual gold. Regular players are often annoyed when these farmers send multiple messages over the citywide chat in the major towns of Ironforge and Ogrimmar. WoW administrators have rarely stepped in to stop message spamming, but players on the Medivh server have found that a well thrown virtual snowball gets the point across much more effectively.\n\nThe repeated killing of monsters to obtain gold and rare items is known in the online world as \"farming\". Many regular players consider farming to be boring, but a necessary evil in their quest for higher levels and better gear. Professional farmers, however, will spend several hours a day killing monsters and selling the rare items because they must make a certain amount of virtual gold per shift. This virtual gold is then sold for real money.[\/i]\n\/end quote","date":"2006-01-03T22:12:23-06:00","rating":18,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ottovoiss","importedSubject":"best use for snowballs ever"},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":2696457,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"You need refreshing spring water to make a snowball.

It is learned from a schematic that can be found in the random presents that are mailed to you from Father Winter during the Christmas season. It does not bind and can be sold or traded as many times as you want.<br /><br />This item only creates one snowball at a time. To create a snowball, you must have one Refreshing Spring Water which can be bought from a food and drink vendor for 20 copper per stack of 5. It is a 25 second cast and has a 24 hour cooldown.<br /><br />The purpose of this item is to create a snowball that can be used as a reagent for Christmas-related items when the event has passed and snowballs are no longer available for purchase. For example, in order to use the Red or Green Helper Box, you need 1 snowball as a reagent.<br /><br />Happy hunting,<br />Darksbane</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>to make snowballs! i just bought it (cost me 23g for the schematic)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>are snowballs for anything else besides throwing?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Do these things remain on your character when the winter's over? Would be nice if you could have snowballs in June...<br /><br />(I can imagine the snowballs would go up in price during the summer then)<br /><br />And another question: can the snowballs produced be used as materials for a new SnowMaster 9000?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yes im nutz will pay 100gp for this machine OR the recipe ..my 10 yr old lives to toss snowballs with her toon ..please drop me a mail asap !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This isn't that great, believe me.<br /><br />You can only make ONE snowball per 24 hours. So in about a week you'll have enough snowballs for 5 minutes of fun. It would be much better if you could make 2 snowballs per day (or more).<br /><br />Also, if you have more than one snowmaster, they all share the same cooldown. So no matter how many Snowmasters you have, you can still only make 1 snowball per day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've heard that the schematic for this is from a quest is that true?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dont buy the schematic. the santa of each faction gives this as a present (random). it used to sell for 400g. now, only 50g.<br /><br />the snowball maker itself takes 20 seconds to use, makes 1 snowball, and has a 24 hour cool-down. u can buy snowballs like MAD right now (since xmas stuff is there)<br /><br />comment made, dec 16 2k5</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>World of Warcraft players use virtual snowballs to deal with Gold Farmers</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/2005/12/20/wow_snowball_goldfarmer/%3Cbr%3E" rel="nofollow">http://www.tgdaily.com/2005/12/20/wow_snowball_goldfarmer/<br /></a><br />/ quote <i><br />World of Warcraft players have discovered a more direct and more satisfying way of dealing with &quot;gold farmers&quot;. The farmers make real money by exchanging dollars for virtual gold. Regular players are often annoyed when these farmers send multiple messages over the citywide chat in the major towns of Ironforge and Ogrimmar. WoW administrators have rarely stepped in to stop message spamming, but players on the Medivh server have found that a well thrown virtual snowball gets the point across much more effectively.<br /><br />The repeated killing of monsters to obtain gold and rare items is known in the online world as &quot;farming&quot;. Many regular players consider farming to be boring, but a necessary evil in their quest for higher levels and better gear. Professional farmers, however, will spend several hours a day killing monsters and selling the rare items because they must make a certain amount of virtual gold per shift. This virtual gold is then sold for real money.</i><br />/end quote</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What can you do with snowballs? Are they just like leather balls?
