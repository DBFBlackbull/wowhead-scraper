<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got one. Soloed the mine three times (so far). Was actually going for Cookie's siamese cat. Guess it was a consolation prize.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anybody know how much a horde would pay for one of these at the neutral AH in Gadgetzan?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Horde don't have to go to the Gadgetzan AH for this.&nbsp; I ran the Deadmines solo just to spite the Alliance (I also ran the Stockades) and I ended up with this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've run deadmines several times, as has my roommate, and I looted one of these earlier tonight. Neither of us had ever looted one before, so they're definitely not a common drop. ^_^ I looted it from an elite on the boat near VC, can't recall exactly from what.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got one, lvl 44 rogue, stealthed in to kill vancleef only to find that i needed to trigger something for him to spawn.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To person above, you probably have a addon which is telling you the % drop chance, and if you havnt killed at least 500 it will be fairly innaccurate</div>
