Most zones (all?) that have the fishing nodes have Oily Blackmouth nodes.\n\nYou can fish them up with a skill of 1, I think, at least in Darkshore, and presumably in other level 10-20 zones. Until the 1.9 Patch, you needed a skill of perhaps 25 just to be able to fish in Darkshore, but this no longer seems to be the case. This might be due to the fact that skilling up in fishing has slowed down a lot at the beginning.\n\nSo pull out those fishing poles, grab the lures you have the skill to use, and go collect fishies.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's used for those:<br /><br />-Elixir of Water Breathing (Alchemy)<br />(Allows the Imbiber to breather water for 30 min.)<br /><br />-Free Action Potion (Alchemy)<br />(Makes you immune to Root, Snare and Stun effects for the next 30 sec.)<br /><br />-Swim Speed Potion (Alchemy)<br />(Increases swim speed by 100% for 20 sec.)<br /><br />-Enchant Gloves - Fishing (Enchanting)<br />(Permanently enchant gloves to grant +2 fishing skill.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive been fishing like crazy lately trying to catch these fish to make the water breathing potion, but i havent caught a single one yet. i dunno if because im fishing in the wrong spot or what. thats probably the reason though. can someone post up the best place in the darkshore area to find these fish? my character is named somaliran. if u see me on kilrogg, lemme know please! ill make u some for free:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I fished a ton of oily blackmouth in the Fogotten Oasis in the Barrens. Probably about 15% of my catches. (I was around level 90-130 fishing at the time)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Catching them around 30-40% of the time at <b>Zoram Strand</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't find the blackmouth oil recipe at the alchamists at either Stormwind or Ironforge.&nbsp; Where do you get it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can some one tell me what lvl fishing you have to be to get the Blackmouth fish if you whant message me the names (vahn) thank you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Alright you guys. Let's see if this helps..<br /><br />You don't need a specific skill to catch this fish, just the skill to fish in the area. For instance, Booty Bay fishing has a lot of these. To fish there, your skill needs to be 130+ with bait. Without bait, it's hell. <br /><br />For the Blackmouth Oil, you just need to talk to the trainer. I don't believe you need to hunt and buy a recipe. <br /><br />The uses of the Oil are many, including enchanting and alchemy. The potions that use the oil, such as the Swim Speed Potion, sell for a lot in the AH if you time it right. <br /><br />And like all fish, these are rare in some places. With bait, you'll catch these and other fish used for cooking, alchemy, and other proffs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know where I can find elixir of water-walking?&nbsp; sounds really cool--thanks!<br />(Ruwen; Durotan, Nikai, Durotan)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If i want the oil do i have to fish to obtain the oil easily.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have searched Undercity, Orgrimmar and Thunderbluff, but can't find a trainer to learn me this. Can anyone help?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think around 65 might be the skill level you need in fishing to get these.&nbsp; Was fishing off Westfall and by Auberdine, and I wasn't catching any until I hit 65 (used regular fishing rod).&nbsp; After that I was catching them about 15% of the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I'm wondering if I can get more $$$ selling the fish, the blackmouth oil or the end item pots you make with the oil... any ideas?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How high has your skill in fishing to be when you can fish Oily Blackmouth?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><i>How am i supposed to get this?&nbsp; i do not have fishing.</i><br /><br />Simple. Get fishing. *smack*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know why Elixir of Waterwalking was taken out ? I would love to act like god, but now it seems you actually have to be a god and play a shaman.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Most of the previous information is accurate - up to the point of the 1.9 patch which made some interesting changes to fishing.<br /><br />Right now, you can fish up Oily Blackmouth in quite a number of zones, most obvious being those zones that have Oily Blackmouth schools of fish (the new fishing nodes). Most zones (all?) that have the fishing nodes have Oily Blackmouth nodes.<br /><br />You can fish them up with a skill of 1, I think, at least in Darkshore, and presumably in other level 10-20 zones. Until the 1.9 Patch, you needed a skill of perhaps 25 just to be able to fish in Darkshore, but this no longer seems to be the case. This might be due to the fact that skilling up in fishing has slowed down a lot at the beginning.<br /><br />So pull out those fishing poles, grab the lures you have the skill to use, and go collect fishies. It's a terrific thing for Alchemists.<br /><br />EDIT: I would assume Elixir of Waterwalking doesn't have any further information because it didn't make it into the live version of the game over a year ago - I've never heard of it since starting a year ago.&nbsp; But YAY! for Priest Levitate ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blackmouth form in schools near the shoreline of Westfall, and can be fished very effectively there. <br /><br />If you start on the beach in the north-east corner, nearest to StormWind, you can walk the beach or swim offshore until you see a light grey patch of water near the shore which has a school of fish swimming under it. These are usually Blackmouth. If you travel the length of WestFall shoreline you might see 5 or 6 schools in one pass. <br /><br />Try to drop your fishing line in the grey area, and you'll pull up a blackmouth about 80% of the time (rough estimate). You will pull 6 to 10 <br />Blackmouth before the school is fished out and the circle disappears. You also seem more likely to catch a box or chest with a nice drop in it (I got some lvl 14 mail gloves once).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When you see a circle of ripples in a body of water throw your cursor over it, you will get a tooltip telling you what kind of fish.&nbsp; It works like mining, you only have a certain amount of catches before the &quot;node&quot; runs dry, and move on to the next node.&nbsp; I also discovered that your bobber has to be fairly close to the &quot;target&quot; of ripples for the best chance at catching said fish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To get the blackmouth oil, you must:<br /><br />A) Be a Journeyman Alchemist, not beginner, people get this confused, because you only need 80 skill in alchemy but you must be a journeyman alchemist<br /><br />B) well i have now forgotten the reason for B but umm... just look at A</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have caught these fish off the dock of southshore with no bait what so ever will have to double check what my fishing lvl is but they were swimming there so I just threw my line in the water and caught 7 before they vanished</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I cant catch anything.&nbsp; Am i just not patient enough how long does it take to catch something or how many goes?<br /><br />Also, above that guy who didnt have fishing.&nbsp; Fishing is a secondary skill you can do all three sec skills (cooking, fishing and first aid) along with your primary skills.&nbsp; It is helpful to just train in all three sec skills as you might find you need them from time to time.</div>
