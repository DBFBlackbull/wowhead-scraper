From my understanding there's some stuff you have to do and then once that stuff is done you are capable of looting it from fishing in a certain place. However it is also my understanding that this place is bugged and will not drop the Ashbringer via fishing even after you have done this stuff.\n\nTo be more specific.\nWhat is this stuff?\nMy guess is that you have to get exalted with the Shen' dralar (the library guys in DM). This is an utterly amazing feat, because there isn't really any repeatable quests you can do to gain rep. Every now and then you will see one of the librarians say that they had lost a book. Well, you are able to give them that book for rep. It's probably not a good idea to turn it in (with the prices the books are going for in AH). Anyways, once you have gotten the thoroughly read copy of Nat Pagle's Extreme Anglin' and have beaten Nefarion talk to the prince and give him the book. He will start talking about the Ashbringer, however he will say that he won't help you until you have defeated Nefarion. My theory is that once you are exalted he will tell you the location, or give you some item that when you fish with it in posession you can get the Ashbringer. Where this location is I have no idea. Maybe it's in BWL somewhere. Or maybe you have to swim behind mountains for a long time and fish behind Silithus or EPL. Anyways, from what I understand, the place to fish for it is bugged and the Ashbringer will not drop.

I have 300 hundred fishing (not sure if that's a req or not) and I visited Nat Pagle; no dice. She didn't have anything to say.<br /><br />I cant think of anyone else to visit.<br /><br />Does anyone know?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ditto. What's this for? And what's the pocket lint for, too?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where exactly did you find it? the book and the lint are pointless, but sometimes the dusty tome spawns one of the blue class books :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Grey book...just for kicks I stuck it in AH at 25g buyout...it sold.<br /><br />People have too much gold it seems.<br /><br />Should have tried the pocket lint too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Could anyone who has this book copy the text of it here please ?<br />I'm searching for it myself but haven't been able to find it so far. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>... And so that's where you'll find the legendary sword of the Scarlet Highlord, Ashbringer.<br /><br />Ain't it amazin' what you run into in an ordinary day of fishin'?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>beatkael did you get it because ive talked to every singe ogre in DM and not 1 word about fishing.&nbsp; Since im a warrior im interested in fishing up Ashbringer, but so far ive spent about 72 hours alone fishing in places that i've heard it has been found but no luck...and i still dont see the connection between the scarlet highlord and the sword.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was just woundering, how the hell do u talk to th ogres in DM ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Other than when you're king, i dont think you can so i disregard what was said above.&nbsp; AV is supposedly where it is fished up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have 2 books: <br />- A Thoroughly Read Copy of &quot;Nat Pagle's Extreme' Anglin.&quot;<br />- Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin']<br />what should i to do now?<br />fishing?<br />where?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You must combine this book with a book that drops in AV, in those you can read where to fish up Ashbringer or something like that anyway :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The people who have Ashbringer is a GM.... <br />And a Shaman watch it.<br />A Shaman can�t use a sword... and when a people can�t use a weapon its&nbsp; &lt;Red&gt;<br /><br />Sry for my Englisch but i am from Germany and i can�t speak very good english -.-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everything about the Ashbringer has thus far been speculation. From my understanding there's some stuff you have to do and then once that stuff is done you are capable of looting it from fishing in a certain place. However it is also my understanding that this place is bugged and will not drop the Ashbringer via fishing even after you have done this stuff.<br /><br />To be more specific.<br />What is this stuff?<br />My guess is that you have to get exalted with the Shen' dralar (the library guys in DM). This is an utterly amazing feat, because there isn't really any repeatable quests you can do to gain rep. Every now and then you will see one of the librarians say that they had lost a book. Well, you are able to give them that book for rep. It's probably not a good idea to turn it in (with the prices the books are going for in AH). Anyways, once you have gotten the thoroughly read copy of Nat Pagle's Extreme Anglin' and have beaten Nefarion talk to the prince and give him the book. He will start talking about the Ashbringer, however he will say that he won't help you until you have defeated Nefarion. My theory is that once you are exalted he will tell you the location, or give you some item that when you fish with it in posession you can get the Ashbringer. Where this location is I have no idea. Maybe it's in BWL somewhere. Or maybe you have to swim behind mountains for a long time and fish behind Silithus or EPL. Anyways, from what I understand, the place to fish for it is bugged and the Ashbringer will not drop. You can go ahead and try my theory but you will probably be thoroughly dissappointed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those of you wondering what the sword has to do with the Scarlet Crusade, it turns out that some guy who worked for the Crusade did in fact make it for the highlord, and was then killed, and for any backup, there is a tauren in the bulwark that mentions someone in the crusade making a &quot;remarkable weapon&quot;.<br /><br />As for it's location it's all still a big debate, since Blizz apparently took the quest to get it out, and will be implementing a new one later. Still some people think fishing in WPL/EPL with 425 fishing works.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I probaly doubt that blizzard would tell you where all the legendary items are. Maybe there is even artifacts, but noone has founded them. Or if has, they won't tell it on and on. <br />From my recharge i have examined that GM:s don't use enykind's of weapons/armors. Just GM robes.<br />I doubt that you all got some friends in blizzard who just tells you where to find all the legendary items. So keep on looking and stop whining =) And i haven't seen any pages(official) where blizzard tells that Sulfuron and Thunderfury are the only legendary weapons, that would ruin the game? if has. just post me the link.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>maybe u have to have all of Nat Pagles gear on to catch it. Just an idea. hehe =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what i think you haev to do is get exalted with the libray guys then talk to the prience so he will tell you because 1 of the elves say that the priences favriote store is the Ashbringer 1 then he tells you crapbla bla bla then you go from there thats my gess!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>why i found it at 150g buyout in ah? is this book important?:S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ashbringer is A mysterious an Odd sword Theres a corrupted version in naxx which someone out of curioisity took to SM(think tis curiosity)As he heard someone made enchanted weapons for the crusade This triggered an event which in summary left morgraine dead from his father(The Ashbringer not the sword)Which was supposed to be dead but came back AGAIN after you killed him as a hroseman in naxx anyway the Little undead in the side room begins talking about how it was an ambush by his son and bla bla bla eventually he points to the sky and says search his other son In outland <br />By this i know two things <br />1:you cant do this questline yet <br />2:this is one of the questlines that requires more guessing and Brute Force and probably Sheer Luck than the other weapons which are crafted with Either By a Giant amount of materiels or finding A hard to get item or two instead of 100 expensive ones.Anyway back to ashbringer it could well be related to fishing because this already shows as an active QUESTLINE its not of the crafted variety and its supposed to be an odd questline too <br />PS i think i heard someone say that fishing only has to do with that kel thuzad found it somehow and this bit passed already</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sythee.. how exactly did you go about getting Ashbringer? Don't keep everyone else in the dark. A step by step guid would be great, lol. It hits harder than the hand of rag so it has to be hard to get, but still, if its humanly possible.. You better beleive I'll try.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>once you get the corrupted ashbringer and bring it to SM the ghost of Highlord Mograine appears and kills Scarlet Commander Mograine, his son who lead him to the Scourge ambush where he was killed. Then High Inquisitor Fairbanks, tells you the story of how he watched the Highlord murdered while trapped under a pile of corpses. He then tells you that the Corrupted Ashbringer can not be cleansed, and that the Highlord had a second son who could reforge it, but that son now resides in outlands. The chain stops there, and the hints in the book are just that, tantalizing hints from before the Highlord was killed</div>
