There is a 2 mob patrol up there so watch for them.&nbsp; Once up the stairs take the passageway on the right.&nbsp; You'll find yourself on a small ledge with a couple of rocks on it.&nbsp; Looking down and left you'll see a doorway with 5 or 6 mobs out in front of it.&nbsp; You'll be going through it.&nbsp; There is another 2 mob patrol which passes through here, so stay up on the ledge and watch for them.&nbsp; As soon as they pass through below you, down you go.\n\nThe doorway leads into a small passageway which bends back and forth a couple of times quickly, and opens up into a large area.&nbsp; When you enter here you'll get the onscreen text that you've entered Hordemar City.\n\nOn entering this area, turn right and stay along the right wall.&nbsp; In the distance you'll see another area with one and two headed ogres.&nbsp; Go to the edge along the right wall and look down; you'll see a ledge to drop down on.&nbsp; Drop down and continue forward, you'll see another ledge to drop down and turn left.&nbsp; Down below you'll see lava.\n\nAfter this second drop off, take off your invis and make your way straight.&nbsp; You'll come to another drop off which overlooks a large orc encampment.&nbsp; You'll be making your way to the RIGHT after you jump.\n\nThe jump can cause damage and drop your invis, which is why you dropped it earlier; now when you jump you'll be able to invis right away upon landing without having to wait for it to recycle.\n\nThere is one patrol mob which wanders the camp and one more that wanders back and forth in the middle of it.&nbsp; They are not hard to avoid.&nbsp; Note that as you make your way through this camp you are not going through the end where you have to go in between rocks; you go the other way (to the right as you looked down upon it from the ledge you jumped from.)\n\nAt the end of the orc camp is a ramp up, and you'll see spiders on it.&nbsp; Mother is at the top.&nbsp; Watch the pattern of the spiders on the ramp and run up along the left side of the ramp (I usually burn our sprint ability here.)&nbsp; Stay along the left wall until you are past Mother and set up in the corner once you're past her.\n\nThe fight is as others have said, though I used more of a diagonal path.&nbsp; It's tight in here, but its very doable.&nbsp; There is a rock in the middle of this area that you use to kill her and it seemed to cause a graphics glitch where she would pop right on top of me as soon as a nuke hits her, but don't worry, she is not really there yet and won't hit you for the 2 seconds it takes her to run to you normally.\n\nI died the first time I fought her but never after that.&nbsp; LOOT QUICKLY and enjoy the fast death you suffer at the hands of the spiders that spawn after she's down.\n\nEvery druid should have Wildheart Boots, there is no reason not to with this approach.&nbsp;

Try to Hibernate her as close to you as possible in order for you to switch places with her again and again (those who have read the posts and\/or tried already will know what I'm talking about). If this means waiting a split second to cast Hibernate after you wake her up with Starfire, then do that.\n\n2. Be ready for her to wake up early, because she will.

Don't freak out if she wakes up early and gets to you. DON'T MOVE or you might aggro others. Just spam the Hibernate button and if you have decent gear (even greens), she'll be put to sleep and you shouldn't lose more than about 1\/2 health at worst even if she stuns you (I am 60 and have nothing but blues). BTW for this fight - Sta is more important than Int.\n\n4. Obviously, cure the poison she gives you.\n\n5. When you are one or two Starfires from killing her, it is more important than ever to make sure you are keeping her far away from you in your Starfire-Hibernate Switcheroo, because when she dies, about 5 little Lvl 55 spiders will pop out of her and they WILL immediately aggro on you and kill you if you're too close.\n\nAfter the spiders pop, go bear form and run up to her and shift-click her body to auto loot everything she has.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9232</b></h3>If you are druid You don't need party to get this. Mother Smolderweb is easy to solo, just get to her in stealth, buff in corner away from adds and fire starfire, then hibernate. Repeat until you kill her, simply but:<br />- you have to wait about 20sec between shoots to regain mana<br />- watch out for adds around, try to not aproach to close when avoiding spider boss.<br /><br />Good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>at least 20+ Smolderweb runs. What do I get? Nothing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wow took me about 10 tries to kill him, the key is you gotta be patient i must of cast hibernate 200 times took me about 30-40 mins to kill back and forth back and forth, starfire, hibernate, run away, hibernate again for good measure, then wait for mana a few secs then repeat.&nbsp; But i got the boots on my first kill!&nbsp; Well worth the frustration haha.&nbsp; Good luck all</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took me a few deaths to figure out where this is, so here is my walkthru.&nbsp; It took me 4 kills to get my boots.&nbsp; I did this at level 60.<br /><br />On zoning in, make your way up the beginning ramp to the first room.&nbsp; Catform and invis.&nbsp; The first room has mobs on each side and there is one mob that roams back and forth from a fire on the right and over to the left where he sits down.<br /><br />Take the stairs on the right up.&nbsp; There is a 2 mob patrol up there so watch for them.&nbsp; Once up the stairs take the passageway on the right.&nbsp; You'll find yourself on a small ledge with a couple of rocks on it.&nbsp; Looking down and left you'll see a doorway with 5 or 6 mobs out in front of it.&nbsp; You'll be going through it.&nbsp; There is another 2 mob patrol which passes through here, so stay up on the ledge and watch for them.&nbsp; As soon as they pass through below you, down you go.<br /><br />The doorway leads into a small passageway which bends back and forth a couple of times quickly, and opens up into a large area.&nbsp; When you enter here you'll get the onscreen text that you've entered Hordemar City.<br /><br />On entering this area, turn right and stay along the right wall.&nbsp; In the distance you'll see another area with one and two headed ogres.&nbsp; Go to the edge along the right wall and look down; you'll see a ledge to drop down on.&nbsp; Drop down and continue forward, you'll see another ledge to drop down and turn left.&nbsp; Down below you'll see lava.<br /><br />After this second drop off, take off your invis and make your way straight.&nbsp; You'll come to another drop off which overlooks a large orc encampment.&nbsp; You'll be making your way to the RIGHT after you jump.<br /><br />The jump can cause damage and drop your invis, which is why you dropped it earlier; now when you jump you'll be able to invis right away upon landing without having to wait for it to recycle.<br /><br />There is one patrol mob which wanders the camp and one more that wanders back and forth in the middle of it.&nbsp; They are not hard to avoid.&nbsp; Note that as you make your way through this camp you are not going through the end where you have to go in between rocks; you go the other way (to the right as you looked down upon it from the ledge you jumped from.)<br /><br />At the end of the orc camp is a ramp up, and you'll see spiders on it.&nbsp; Mother is at the top.&nbsp; Watch the pattern of the spiders on the ramp and run up along the left side of the ramp (I usually burn our sprint ability here.)&nbsp; Stay along the left wall until you are past Mother and set up in the corner once you're past her.<br /><br />The fight is as others have said, though I used more of a diagonal path.&nbsp; It's tight in here, but its very doable.&nbsp; There is a rock in the middle of this area that you use to kill her and it seemed to cause a graphics glitch where she would pop right on top of me as soon as a nuke hits her, but don't worry, she is not really there yet and won't hit you for the 2 seconds it takes her to run to you normally.<br /><br />I died the first time I fought her but never after that.&nbsp; LOOT QUICKLY and enjoy the fast death you suffer at the hands of the spiders that spawn after she's down.<br /><br />Every druid should have Wildheart Boots, there is no reason not to with this approach.&nbsp; Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I decided to try soloing Mother after reading these comments. I had a melee gear on which was a doomed idea from the beginning. My mana ran low very quickly plus I aggroed those little spiders from the corner. Certain death. On the second try I had Int gear on, but I still had to Hibernate spam Mother for a long time to get Innervate cooldowns off. Needed two Innervates and a lot of patience. All in all, Hibernate+Starfire combo is an easy way to solo that Mothersmolder. Just got to remember to keep some mana for spare all the time, since the Hibernation doesn't always last for that 30 seconds. Getting to her was easy too, at least on level 60. But I got the boots on the first kill and I must say I feel pretty darn good. So go get them!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Using the excellent instructions that someone above wrote I can solo her fairly easily now, done it about 5 times so far, no WH :P&nbsp; I still need to figure out how fast to space my attacks so I don't waste time with full mana when innervate is ready.&nbsp; Last time when I rezzed after looting I still had 25 min CD on my IF hearthstone, so I guess that's decent.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just soloed her for the 20th time, still no boots.&nbsp; I'v seen the eye three times and a few of the 0.2%s.&nbsp; Guess I'll keep plugging away...<br /><br />I'm 30 feral / 21 resto, and it's not too bad.&nbsp; I usually don't need any pots, and use four or five bandages.&nbsp; Takes about 22-23 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Please tell more about what talents you have, because i also wanna solo her :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am not quite sure what you are missing. And the fact that your Hibernate for some reason last so short is a big obstacle I can tell. But I cannot say what could be the reason. I have never had that thing happen to me. Only if she gets to close to me and damage or posion me.<br /><br />But I can say you could need more spirit. Just a thought if possible. I have around 340 in spirit, 295 in intellect. Around +300 in healing, and I restore 8 mana per 5 sec. And it is still a tough fight for me, believe me.<br />But the Hibernate issue would make it even harder. Normally I can stretch Hibernate to last...Well 10 seconds is the longest I risk. Then I Hibernate her again just to be sure.<br /><br />But really the Invulnerability Potions may help. At least worth a try :) I just find that Hibernate last longer that way, and the fact that you cannot take fysical damage for 6 seconds is quite some time.<br /><br />I wish you the best of luck, either in trying again, and if not then in finding a group to Lbrs. Which can be just as hard unfortunately</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After three failed attempts last night, I decided I'd use some potions to make it go faster/easier. I stocked up on Superior Mana Potions (4), Major Mana Potions (1), Superior Healing Potions (5), Nature Resistance Potions (4), Wizard Oil (1 charge), Scroll of Spirit IV, Stamina and Intellect potions if no Priests/Mages are nice enough to give you the hour-long buff (it's courtesy to provide them with the reagent for it, or enough to get a new one). While it's probably overkill, I prefer to b e overprepared than underprepared.<br /><br />I would spam-click Hibernate the second my nuke was almost done casting. Sometimes she'd make it halfway to me and the safe point, in which case I would use Wrath and hibernate, and then go back to the usual method. There were a few close calls the last fight. I never let myself drop below 1800 mana, just in case of an emergency (ie, Natures Swiftness and Hibernate, remove poison, heal self, rehibernate, move, rehibernate and wait for mana to regen).<br /><br />It takes a while, and a lot of focus, but it *is* doable.<br /><br />My only question is, what are those unfired gauntlets for by the little tunnel where you drop off into Hordemar city?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well actually, the first time I aggroed some nearby spiders and I died, the second time I didn't keep my cool and she killed me, but the 3rd time (the 1st time I actually killed her) my boots dropped.<br /><br />Rules:<br /><br />1. Try to Hibernate her as close to you as possible in order for you to switch places with her again and again (those who have read the posts and/or tried already will know what I'm talking about). If this means waiting a split second to cast Hibernate after you wake her up with Starfire, then do that.<br /><br />2. Be ready for her to wake up early, because she will. When sitting down and getting your Int back, keep a steady eye on her, have her targetted and be ready to stand and click Hibernate immediately in case she wakes.<br /><br />3. Don't freak out if she wakes up early and gets to you. DON'T MOVE or you might aggro others. Just spam the Hibernate button and if you have decent gear (even greens), she'll be put to sleep and you shouldn't lose more than about 1/2 health at worst even if she stuns you (I am 60 and have nothing but blues). BTW for this fight - Sta is more important than Int.<br /><br />4. Obviously, cure the poison she gives you.<br /><br />5. When you are one or two Starfires from killing her, it is more important than ever to make sure you are keeping her far away from you in your Starfire-Hibernate Switcheroo, because when she dies, about 5 little Lvl 55 spiders will pop out of her and they WILL immediately aggro on you and kill you if you're too close.<br /><br />After the spiders pop, go bear form and run up to her and shift-click her body to auto loot everything she has. You should easily be able to live long enough in Bear to loot her. I even managed to kill one before they ganked me.<br /><br />The little spiders will now kill you, so death is inevitible, but it was fun, eh?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can anyone clarify if these still drop from this mob?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A lvl 60 rogue friend and I tried it and it was actually way harder to kill her that way (we never actually succeeded in 3 tries).&nbsp; A 3rd person along (either rogue or druid) would have made her farmable from a safe, quick, standpoint.<br /><br />However, barring 3 people doing stealth runs, the solo-hibernate routine was easy once I got the hang of it.<br /><br />Summary of 'tricks' to use<br /><br />Limited Invulnerability potion(s)<br />Bandages for healing<br />A few potions (I had to drink one mana pot)<br />Barkskin (for when she resists or crystallizes you)<br />let hibernate work for 25+ seconds before starfiring - use a clock.&nbsp; <br /><br />It did seem that if I didn't wait long enough she would begin a pattern of breaking early which eventually would result in death.&nbsp; Using the clock method, she only broke early about 3 times.&nbsp; The entire process took about 22 minutes of combat.<br /><br />Since lvl 58 is when improved hibernate is available for training and since she is lvl 59, I would NOT try this before lvl 58 in spite of what other people may have posted.&nbsp; I was 59 and she only broke early about 3 times (once I learned to wait longer) and only resisted about 3 times.<br /><br />Buffs:<br />MoW (duh)<br />Arcane elixir (will save you a couple of starfires)<br />Either Int potion or the one that gives 18 to int+spirit (I forget the name)<br />Food for 12stam +12 spirit... this will run out but helps while it lasts.<br />I brought along crystal force from un'goro crater to buff my spirit when my food ran out.<br />(as others said do NOT put thorns on)<br /><br />I'm feral spec, so no innervate or quick healing touch, but barkskin and one time a limited invulnerability potion saved me.&nbsp; I have 6000 mana and 2800 life when buffed.&nbsp; <br /><br />It took me 2 deaths before I got her, although the limited invulnerability potion I made saved my bottom when she was within 3 starfires of dying.&nbsp; I didn't have invuln potions the first 2 times when I died.&nbsp; The successful run I only drank 1 mana pot (compared to 3 pots on the unsuccessful runs).&nbsp; The invuln potion came in handy when she interrupted me with crystalize, then resisted the next one, then crystallized me again!&nbsp; By the time I drank the potion I was down to 300 health.&nbsp; But the potion gives 6 seconds to recover which is pleny of time.&nbsp; It IS on the same cooldown timer as health/mana potions though, so be aware.<br /><br />Got the boots on the first successfull kill as well as 2 ironweb silks --- 5g each!&nbsp; This is probably the one thing I've been lucky at, I almost never get lucky drops.<br /><br />Thanks for the great guide Dianius!&nbsp; That really helped make the process painless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Easy to get to and fairly easy to kill once you get the timing down, but the drop rate has been horrible so far.&nbsp; Trinket and bracers drop like crazy though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have solo'd (8), duo'd(6), and group(5) killed this spider 19 times now... and still no boots.&nbsp; I must have the worst luck.&nbsp; Keys to solo'ing her are (1)Don't aggro other spiders when pulling her (2)Keeping a good distance between you and her during the fight (3)heavy runecloth bandages so you don't waste mana on healing yourself&nbsp; (4)Innervate (or mana pots) (5) Don't panic when she resists Hibernate... just keep doing it until you get her asleep (Nature's Swiftness helps here)&nbsp; It takes me about 15 minutes to kill her (I have 20 pts in Balance with 5 in Vengeance).&nbsp; The ironweb spider silk almost make it worth it even if the boots don't drop.&nbsp; They sell good now after the patch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just wanted to say good job on the guide Dianius. If anyone is doubtfull or just interested, Dianius's guide works like a charm for soloing Mother Smolderweb.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mrc.soton.ac.uk/lstyles/MotherSmolderwebGuide/MotherSmolderwebGuide.htm" rel="nofollow"> Soloing Mother Smolderweb</a><br /><br />Died my first attempt from agro, but after that was a peace of cake. I don't have Innervate or Nature's Swiftness, or any talent points in Balance. Took a little while and a few heavy runecloth bandages. Managed to get away without using any potions either. Definitely worth the 20-25 minutes it takes to kill her. Thanks!<br /><br />-= Rasp<br />60 Druid<br />Emerald Dream</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried this tonight -- the guide is great and worked very well.&nbsp; A couple of things to point out though:<br /><br />1) In the last batch of Orcs that the pic shows going diagonally through, Blizzard has added another one right in the center.&nbsp; I'm level 59 and it was still possible for me to squeeze between them, but I doubt a 56 could now.<br /><br />2) It occured to me towards the end that I could use purification pots instead of abolish poison.&nbsp; I usually only use it for diseases, but it helped reduce the mana drain.<br /><br />3) I'm balanced spec'd, and using moonkin form was totally the way to go.&nbsp; She did WAY less damage, and I did significantly more.&nbsp; I didn't try it at first because I didn't want to suck the mana going back and forth, but it was totally worth it.&nbsp; In fact, since I used the purification pots and could use bandages in moonkin, I only had to shift towards the end to give me rejuvination just in case (wasn't necessary).&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and since everyone said it was a suicide mission, I didn't try to kill the spiders that spawned.&nbsp; I assumed I'd die in an instant, but halfway through I wish I had given it a shot -- they didn't seem that bad (and took a lot longer to kill me than I figured).<br /><br />By the way, though I died 3 or four times in the whole thing (mostly getting to close to the other spiders and agroing the mob), she dropped the boots the first time I killed her.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has any balance talented druids attempted her? Does Starfire w/ stun talent help at all?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm not sure how to time it between innervate, potions, bandages etc.&nbsp; Tried 4 times and got him down to 1/3 of health but none of my cooldowns were ready for mana/health.&nbsp; Anybody try this with a rogue with them.&nbsp; Maybe starfire, hibenate, starfire, hiberate, then when she is close, starfire, backstab, hibernate, repeat.&nbsp; Soloing must take a LOT of patience.&nbsp; Also what is the longest and/or shortest amount of time hianksbernate lasts on her.&nbsp; Thanks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried it a couple of times, i havent got the boots yet but i killed her like 4 times now. I am balance with moonkin form. I most of the times die when i have to heal and when i am in caster form the crits are messed up. like 500-600. and the stun and the resist factor makes me get killed pretty often. I hope to get the boots within 2 times or else i am getting pissed.<br /><br />3 of the 4 times i got the mace wich sells for 5G at the vendor though ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I Dont get why its so hard. one peice of advice to save you rapair bills is this...When you have her to 5% or less throw on a regrowth then a rejuv and rethrow thorns then go bear.The heal over time will keep you alive until you need frenzied regeneration.I have solod her 7 times now..still no boots but i kill the babies too.Im 30/21</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dianius's guide worked perfectly.&nbsp; Fortunately, they dropped for me on my second attempt.&nbsp; Hope you have gotten yours by now Dianius.<br />Used a few bandages and 1 potion the first time.&nbsp; But after getting the hang of it, I didn't need any for the 2nd run.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>my first run thorught lbrs&nbsp; they dropped , lvl 55 druid resto</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I killed this solo with that solo tactic.<br />Got the boost on the first kill ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're feral, there is a very easy way to kill her that only takes a few minutes. <br /><br />When you get to her, get in the corner so you don't agro anything. Get her attention with SF and/or MF, then go into bear form, engrage, FF and demo roar. Let your rage build up to near full then use Frezied Regeneration. Once FR goes out dump the rest of your rage on maul and/or mangle. <br /><br />Once you start getting worried about your health, bash, then shift out and hibernate. While she's asleep, heal, but don't attack. You want to wait out the hibernate to give your bash and FR as much time to cooldown as possible. When she wakes up fight her again as described above. FR may not be up again, but bash should be (or close enough that you can fight it out until it comes back up). Just fight until your health goes down, then bash, hibernate, heal, repeat.<br /><br />It took me about 5 minutes that way (and I was even able to kill the little spiders after the fight).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was able to stealth my way there entirely, unfortunately it was my first try and she killed me.<br /><br />The hardest part I found was getting around the orcs at the base of the ramp. Contrary to what some people say, I stealthed on the far left between the caster and the sleeping orc. I went carefully as they looked at me a few times, but after a minute I was free and up the ramp.<br /><br />Once I got up the ramp, I waited for the three spiders on the left to go to the right as much as they could from the wall and then used my dash while stealthed in cat form and got up under the ledge where I was stuck trying to get out for a few seconds while an evil 58elite spider kept eyeing me from time to time.<br /><br />After a while, I snuck around and was able to get to the corner everyone said to go to. If Smolderweb doesn't move, back off a bit and she'll move after 20 seconds so you can go (dash or no dash) to the corner.<br /><br />I was able to get her and not aggro anything at all. Unfortunately, she stunned me and it was all over really quickly.<br /><br />Here are photos: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kimopupule/tags/smolderweb/" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/kimopupule/tags/smolderweb/</a><br /><br />Good luck to all who try this - it's definately possible to get to her on a first try and not die. Killing her is another story, but I'll see how that goes.<br /><br />Kimopupule, on Stormrage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just went through LBRS and got the boots the first time the group I was in killed her.&nbsp; Now to work on the other 4 parts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I took my druid down alone and managed to get my boots on the second try. I did the hiberate/starfire routine. Worked great. If you're balance speced like mine, I suggest you throw up your treeants to keep the spiders busy while you loot the boss. I still died, but at least the looting was done.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Starefire routine is great, and does work.<br /><br />Although I just obtained mine by getting another lvl64 Feral Druid to tank Smolderweb.&nbsp; Got the boots on the 5th try.<br /><br />Nargaroth - Lvl 60 Balance Druid<br />Blackwater Raiders</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Half the adventure is figuring it out, I must say. I read very brief guides on how people did it before, they were basically &quot;sleep - moonfire,&quot; which didn't help too much.<br /><br />Really, once you get there, it's fun to figure out. I did it about 8 times to get my boots, 3 times died. Also, doing it pre-60 is a challenge. Ended up finally downing her and geting them at 59, though I started at 57.<br /><br />Pretty nice boots, but not nice looking. &gt;_&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've done like 20 runs and they have dropped like 15 times, the spaulders on the other hand... never seen em drop :|</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got them on about 15+ runs.. finally. If i saw those green mail guants again i was going to cry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Myself (60 Druid), Malandra (60 Druid) and Seraphix (60 Rogue) trioed her quite easily.<br /><br />We stealthed all the way to smolderweb using the shortcut to the immediate right, where you see the ogres.<br /><br />Stealth through the orcs and along the left wall past the spiders. In the corner opposite of the spider groups, you can single pull mother. Rogue pulled, druid bear taunted off while the other druid heals. When low on mana, one druid innervates. If the spider doesn't die before the druid runs out of mana again, druids swap tasks. One heals, other takes over bear form.<br /><br />After kill #18, she finally dropped the boots.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I guess I should feel lucky. These boots dropped for me on my first trip in, and being the only druid they defaulted to me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have done this solo process now 113 times - I dont remember how many venomspitters and eyes I have vendored. I have also been on many many many full man raids and its just not dropping. <br /><br />Any recent bugs or reports of it not dropping - as this is driving me crazy. I have the 6/8, missing boots and cowl. I would have thought I would have the boots by now !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got them on my second run.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Don't bother with the very long method of sleeping + moonfire if you're feral.<br /><br />You can straight tank her if you're feral and place your heals correctly. Very very easy ...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The 19% isn't very acurate, it has changed since then. I've been on numerous BRS runs and it only dropped twice, I'd say the drop chance is about 5-10%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Read the guide how to solo the spider for theese, then i decided to try it with my 60 druid friend (me 58). We got there and did as the guide said, Starfire+Hibernate but with 2 starfire we got her down alot faster, She dropped Wildheart boots and Medallion of grandmarshal morris, not bad for the first try ever on her. Feel lucky do i? =)<br /><br />Spaulders dropped at my second raid run, i guess im just very lucky when i see people whos up to 20th run without drops =(<br /><br />Edited, Fri Nov 4 18:00:41 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i've done two runs for this in a real group/raid. i've also ran it four times in a row with a team of rogues and another fellow druid. never dropped once! hopefully the next couple of runs will do me in, then it's off to UBRS.</div>
