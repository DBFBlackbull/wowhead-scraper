The new sapper charges you can make in TBC also do more damage to you than the targets. I'm not sure what Blizzard is trying to say with these changes. It really is a shame to have sapper charges reduced to their current state. On the plus side if you are unhappy with it TBC will be allowing us to change our specializations.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Insanity</b></h3>Than awesome trick you can pull off with explosives such as this and the new sapper charge. <br /><br />First buy one Flask of Petrification. Select a crowed city (Ironforge or Orgrimmar) during night time on a weekday. With a group of at least 5-10 people (Preferably rogues or mages) run into the city and die near the mailbox. Only do this with 9 people though because you want to save the guy with the Flask for last. Have him run in as soon as you guys are near you bodies and have him drink the flask. All the enemy players will hopefully, start hitting the invincible allied player. As soon as the flask is drained start shooting off them sapper charges and any aoe you have. You should get rewarded with a lot of dead suckers lying at your feet.* <br /><br />*Note you may die in the process due to the &quot;smart&quot; players who don't tag themselves :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where can you obtain the schematic for this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I love them sapper charges for mass pvp use! It deals about 640 damage to all attackers around it! I testet it against some 60 palas and any other player who was unluky to be in my explosive radius!<br /><br />It's so damn funny! You can be a pala for 1 sec! Just run into the enemy lines... let it explode and watch while the yellow 640 pops out of all nearby attackers! <br /><br />And it doesn't deal the full damage against you everytime. It's mostly about the half of the damage you deal. About 350 dmg. And hey.... whats 350dmg for a lvl 60 player? Its restored in no time!<br /><br />Im a UD Rogue, and in my opinion this is one of the best mass pvp engineering devices! <br /><br />no aiming, instant cast, great damage, low ressource cost!<br /><br />Your personal pvp a-bomb!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I wasn't sure of the power of this until I used it. For the &quot;Forsaken Courier&quot; quest, the objective is to kill a level 35 who is guarded by four or five other level 35s. Well, I ran in, hoping to kill the objective, and one-shotted three of them for over 1200 each. It crits! Well, I bubbled up and healed to full, then proceeded to solo all five of them as a level 32 paladin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These make deadmines runs incredibly easy for rogues with no other AoE skills. 1-shot as many elites as you can, then hit evasion, sprint around and aggro EVERYTHING. When there's about 40 of them near you, BOOM! Kill off any stragglers and heal up before doing it all over again.<br /><br />Scares the hell out of people though when you show 'em it for the first time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have just reached lvl 225 on my eng. as a lvl 25 UD rogue and proceeded to Gadgetzan to buildup my skill... The trainor says that I must be lvl 35 to continue with my training.&nbsp; Question. How can you make a bomb for your lvl 20 priest and have him use it?&nbsp; Is this bomb not lvl specific?&nbsp; My harvest reaper is lvl 30 req. is this bomb not? Just asking thanks&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This has a 5 minute cooldown and triggers the one minute cooldown on the rest of the explosives, so no suicide spamming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No, it doesn't have any level requirement, the only requirement it has is 205 Engineering.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Do you use it, it sits on the ground and blows up when a hostile runs over it? Or is it like a bomb thrown at your feet (blows up as soon as you use it), only it does damage to you too?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>its just an instant AOE, similar to blastwave, but no daze ofc :P. Deals the damage listed to all and every single enemy within explosion radius, a damages you too for a little less damage. It can crit ( indepent roll for every target..quite nice when it hits for 1300++). Guess that since its fire damage..fire rst will reduce this damage, even on you. And paladins divine shield works wonders with this, just make sure you trigger it before it runs out..or you will feel the pain :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to gadgetzan and went to the goblin artisan engineer but I cannot find where it is. I got to 220 engineering after the 1.9 patch and cannot find the recipe. If I for some reason do have it, is it a part, or explosive or etc...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can prpbably down a fire protection potion before detonating and absorb all of the potental damage caused to you AND have Absorbtion left over, im gonna try it as soon as the servers are all back up, ill post my results as soon as i can!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is fun with with hellfire, im a destruction spec'd locky (49) with lots of +firedmg gear, <br /><br />1) sac voidwalker for shield<br />2) lay down sapper charge<br />3) cast hellfire<br /><br />750 fire AoE + 200 Fire AoE every second<br /><br />just gotta find a way to get in the middle of a bunch of people</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>- Get 10 Rogues/Druids with Engineering.<br />- Equip everyone with this n1 item.<br />- Stealth into a Raidgroup.<br />- Blast them from nowhere to oblivion.<br /><br />Yes it can crit and it forces Rogues who vanished out of stealth.<br />It ownz :&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This will probably be a rehash of what others have posted so bear with me. My keys to using this item effectively no matter what class are, of course, hitting as many mobs with this while mitigating the personal damage. Easiest ways for me so far are:<br /><br />1) Power Word Shield (Priest)<br /><br />2) (Greater) Fire Protection Potion<br /><br />3) Flame Ward (Mage)<br /><br />4) Flame Resistance Aura (Paladin-a toss up)<br /><br />5) Shield-type trinkets/weap-procs.<br /><br />Wanna do great dmg and be damned sure you keep aggro on you as a Prot Specced Warrior? This is for you! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>in AV i usually use my essence of eranikus to do a widespread AoE after i run into huge groups of players the later a few players die from the 450 damage DoT, i find this item even better for suicide runs ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lots of people underestimate these charges, extremely useful in certain-death situations or just extra damage, and it does crit, 1200 damage so far, it's like a mini-blast wave, cheap to make as well. Have fun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When a Warlock sacrifices a Voidwalker for a shield and then uses the Sapper Charge, will the damage be absorbed?</div>

They accept donations after you heve a craftsman Writs, these are one of the donations. In exchange for the donations you get Insignias (Dawn &amp; Crusade), these you can exchange for goodies. You need 20 sapper charges.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These things are the definition of slaughter for 29 twinks, my friend and I both made gnome rogue twinks, got their engineering up to 240, then gave em these from my main. Sprinting into a flag room, or to the enemy FC, we can wipe the whole room in an instant if we both set em off at the same time. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is the item to use when you're batteling in a BG and is about to die! xD To make good timing you may even make a macro with some-thing like &quot;MYARRGH, take this!&quot; Of course, the horde will only hear some &quot;Buur buur blop&quot; but it's funny anyway ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so i was a lvl 28 warlock in wsg and there was a large group of guys piled up that we were all in fighting in a huge brawl all of a sudden a gnome mage comes in and a huge flame wave blast comes out and spreads dealing 706dmg! Im like &quot;holy %^&amp;*!&quot; because it did more dmg than my max health - 687. I was thinking that it was flame wave....but they don't get that till lvl 30...and it did like 3 times that...hmmm...&nbsp; finnally i decided that it was some super engineering bomb.... guess this is it...<br /><br />freaked me out</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is this a goblin engineer only item or can gnomish engineers learn it too? cuz im 297 and ive yet to see it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dude, gather up 10 engineers and in a 40 man pvp, just have somebody throw a big(ger) one bomb in a mass group, and have 10 guys run in there and activate this sucker... HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This bomb is awesome for the end of the Scarlet Monastery - Armory. <br />After Herod dies, all the lowbie, non-elites rush in. <br />Aggro them all to you, trigger the Goblin Sapper Charge. <br />Most will die right away! Those that do not die will be even weaker than they already were and are easily dispatched. (A mage's AoE effects are a great compliment to this.)<br /><br />Also great in PvP. Use in Flag Room, or at a Resource Flag to damage multiple enemies. You may die, but that was probably going to happen anyway--you just get to put the hurt on more enemies before you go out in a Bang!<br /><br />Goblin Engineer -- FTW!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The blast raidus is something akin to dynamite (about 5 yards) and is centered around character. There is no concentration timer for this; it explodes as soon as your Use it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone ever think of simply using a flame shield (also made by engineering) before hand? Makes the self damage minimal, works great for me! :)</div>
