    <meta name="description" content="Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros is the weapon of choice for Ragnaros the Firelord. This weapon is not dropped, but rather may be created by anyone who has obtained both the Sulfuron Hammer and the Eye of Sulfuras. A blacksmith with a minimum skill of 300 is required to make a Sulfuron Hammer, and the Eye drops only and rarely from Ragnaros himself. The Plans: Sulfuron Hammer are obtained from A Binding Contract by turning in a Sulfuron Ingot into Lokhtos Darkbargainer in the Grim Guzzler in Blackrock Depths. There is no reputation requirement to receive the plans.">

The person who purchased the plans with the Sulfuron Ingot, from the NPC in BRD, was only Honored with Thorium Brotherhood.  You don't need to be revered or exalted.\n\nYou DO NOT get the plans at exalted for free.  The alliance on our server who also created this, used a player who was Exalted with Thorium Brotherhood, and he still had to pay the 1 ingot.  When you combine both the newly created mace, with the Eye (orange) from Rag, it's an instant creation, no cast bar, to create this Legendary.\n\nReally nothing else more to say about it.  Takes a crapload of mats, and is extremely costly to make, however for any guild who consistently is running MC, and likely into BWL...it shouldn't take too long.

You'd have thought with ALL those trips through Molten Core he'd have picked up a few Lawbringer pieces by now? :)\n\nAnyway, I have started the long, drawn out process of collecting for my Sulfuras (I am a level 60 paladin). Have all the arcanite and most of the trivial stuff. Have 2 Sulfuron Ingots so far (from about 10 golemagg kills, still haven't figured the true drop rate yet). Our guild killed Ragnaros twice now  - no Eye of Sulfuras yet. Wonder which is harder to get - the Eye, or the 9 sulfuron ingots at the reputed 10% drop rate from Golemagg?\n\nCan anyone who has killed Golemagg many many times give a better indication of the true drop-rate? By my calculations if you kill Golemagg and Ragnaros once per week - you'd get 4 Eye of Sulfuras for every 8 Sulfuron Ingots - at 10% drop rate on the ingots which doesn't seem right. I got 2 from 10 kills so maybe 20%\/25% is somewhere nearer?\n\nA horde guild on are server got Sulfuras a few weeks back (they were lucky enough to get the Eye of Sulfuras on their 2nd Ragnaros kill!:).

Everytime I come to allakhazam I check any CONSTRUCTIVE post on this weapon, ie about the proc etc but find little information. So here is my conclusion on the Sulfuras after a week of testing:\n\n- The proc rate is about 10-12% (but can peak to 25% its very unstable)and crits up to 500+  plus the additional 75 damage over 10 seconds.\n\n- The fireball does have a RARE chance to proc TWICE IN ONE SWING! Yes I've seen it happen once when I've been monitoring my combat log. This doesn't mean it has a proc on the physical hit, and the SOC hit because I've had 2 fireballs hit a target without the SOC proc going off.\n\n- Molten Core bosses (except Baron Gadden, Ragnaros) do fall victim to the Sulfuras fireball proc. Molten Giants \/ Destroyers too. Firelords are immune.\n\n- The animation binding the Eye of Sulfuras to the Sulfuron Hammer sucks.\n\nSo to anyone interested in this weapon down the road I hope this bit of information helps. It takes a lot of hard work to get this weapon, and a bit of luck on the drop rates.\n\n\n\n\nEdited, Sat Oct  1 16:32:47 2005","date":"2005-10-01T20:16:33-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Thanks for the info Srshaggy.

Then, take a staff (both weapons without +STR), shift, compare your damage with the numbers on your paper. Did it change? No, because your damage is not based on your weapons. You also don't proc while shifted... So pleaaaaase tell me WHYYYYYYYY is this a Druid weapon? Thank you.\n\nSECONDLY\n--------\n\nHave you ever made a paladin? (directed to anyone saying this is \"NOT AT ALL OMG\" a paladin weapon)\nBecause, if you did, you'd realize that the only... ONLY source of damage of a paladin is with its weapon or triggered holy damage BASED on your weapon. (yes I know some people will tell me well you can Judge SoC and still make damage !1!11!11!1!)

As a Druid - personally I'd want the Lava Dredger - but of course wouldn't mind this either.

The reason why many warriors give/pass it to Paladins and Shamans is mainly because many warriors spec Mortal Strike, and well we all know how Mace Spec goes :P.<br /><br />For 2handed fury, this mace is very powerful indeed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2103</b></h3>This weapon is not dropped, but rather may be forged by anyone who has obtained both the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/?item=17193">Sulfuron Hammer</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/?item=17204">Eye of Sulfuras</a>. A skilled (300) blacksmith is required to make the hammer, and the Eye drops only, and rarely (about a 3% rate), off of Ragnaros himself. The plans for the Sulfuron Hammer are obtained by turning in a Sulfuron Ingot to Lokhtos Darkbargainer in the Grim Guzzler in Blackrock Depths. There is no reputation requirement to receive the plans.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3118</b></h3>The Sulfuron Hammer is certianly not worth the cost without having the Eye of Sulfuras. Don't expect to see the EoS drop.<br /><br />If you do with this, prepare to get lots of flack about tanking other 2h's, even if they're updrages.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6626</b></h3>This can be made by combining Sulfuron Hammer (made by a blacksmith with 300 skill) and Eye of Sulfuras (3% drop chance from Ragnaros).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tsarnkoth</b></h3>Even after instances such as BWL, AQ40 and Naxx, this is a very desireable weapon: the proc is a great equalizer to its lower stats as compared to weapons such as Severance and Ashkandi/Kalimdors, although clearly Dark Edge of Insanity and Naxx weapons like Corrupted Ashbringer/Might of Menethil are superior. <br /><br />Still, this weapon will serve for quite some time into the expansion, up until quest items such as the Honed Voidaxe are available (and that's a quest item) - I'm very glad I got mine, and have never had cause to regret not waiting for a 2h sword or axe. The high top end damage and the frequent proc make it a very good option, and it is one that Shamen can equip, unlike the swords.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1589</b></h3>Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros is a crafted/fused mace.<br /><br />It requires you to get a Legendary (Orange) item to drop from Ragnaros, the last boss in MC call the Eye of Sulfuras.<br /><br />Once you have the eye you need to gather mats to make Sulfuras, a worse epic BoE version of the mace that you will then combine with the Eye to form the Legendary mace.<br /><br />Mats for the epic mace are<br />8 Sulfuron Ingots - Drop off Golemagg the Incinerator in MC<br />20 Dark Iron Bars - Made from 8 Dark Iron ore which can only be smelted at the Dark forge in BRD near the MC attunment<br />50 Arcanite Bars<br />25 Essence of Fire<br />10 Blood of the Mountain - Rare drop out of Dark Iron Veins<br />10 Lava Core - Blue BoE drop in MC<br />10 Firey Core - Blue BoE drop in MC<br /><br />You will need someone to craft the epic mace. This requires someone to be exualted with the Thorium Brotherhood. They can be any type of blacksmith to forge the hammer which must be done at the Black Anvil located in BRD at Lord Insindus.<br /><br />Once you have the Eye and the epic hammer fuse them togther to creat Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8325</b></h3>Yeah I heard with the new patch that druids are able to have weapons proc off in cat form or bear form. Which my not be so bad because a druid in my guild just got the eye last week.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8271</b></h3>This is a great wepon for shamen, pallys, wars, and maybe druids no idea. I seen them b4 i dueled one who has it i got OWNED</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6757</b></h3>Druids get 24 AP and 120 HP untalented (slightly more with Heart of the Wild). Not. Terribly. Legendary.<br /><br />Weapon damage and procs are non-factors for weapons in a Druid's form.<br /><br />The burst damage for other classes is solid, however.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8285</b></h3>For warriors only? I think not, fellow shamans! I fell this weapon is better for shamans than warriors, personally. With a Windfury Weapon buff, and when it procs, that's almost a guaranteed fiery ball cast (from mace). So, if you're in a MC run, whether its a pick-up group, or a guild run, you have every right to roll need for the materials!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9805</b></h3>A few interesting tidbits about the Hand of Rag's fireball proc.<br /><br />The following abilities I've found capable of triggering the fireball:<br /><br />Instant attacks such as Heroic or Crusader Strike<br />Seal of Command procs<br />In some cases judgments have triggered the fireball.<br /><br />The fireball is capable of critting. With all of these taken into account, a ret paladin heavy on crit gear has the potential for a heavy total damage output with the help of the fireball proc from a single swing or a series of attacks in a very short amount of time. It is an expensive sucker, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1589</b></h3>The fireball is affected by spell dmg.<br /><br />I tested wearing 400 spell dmg gear VS 0 spell dmg gear. Fireball hits for about 100 more dmg each time with 400spell dmg, not the best spell dmg % but hey it's better than nothing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Let me clear some things up about this:<br /><br />First off, we just created this on the Uldum server in my guild, the link in my sig shows it pictured on our Tauren Warrior. Second one on the server, first Horde side.<br /><br />To clear some things up about creating it...<br /><br />You don't have to have any reputation with the Thorium Brotherhood to purchase the plans, which lets you create the Epic (purple) BOE hammer that you combine with the Eye from Rag. The person who purchased the plans with the Sulfuron Ingot, from the NPC in BRD, was only Honored with Thorium Brotherhood. You don't need to be revered or exalted.<br /><br />You DO NOT get the plans at exalted for free. The alliance on our server who also created this, used a player who was Exalted with Thorium Brotherhood, and he still had to pay the 1 ingot. When you combine both the newly created mace, with the Eye (orange) from Rag, it's an instant creation, no cast bar, to create this Legendary.<br /><br />Really nothing else more to say about it. Takes a crapload of mats, and is extremely costly to make, however for any guild who consistently is running MC, and likely into BWL...it shouldn't take too long. Just wanted to clear the info up, about the rep status you have to attain to purchase the plans...there is none.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well, i tested it in MC full run. Im 28 resto, rest combat, i can make it 10th if i really go mad, i dont have a smallest chance to beat out DPS-freaks!<br /><br />PVE wise, this mace is a waste in the hand of a shaman, u just cant bring the damage other peoples do.<br /><br />PVP wise, it owns! Ofcourse always some luck, but WF proccs enought to beam-out some peoples!<br /><br />koc</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Eye is COMBINED with the other 2H mace to make this. You dont have to have any profession to combine them. &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />Btw: Bcerda, a 2H mace with high DPS is very good for any paladin. No warrior should be exclusive to get this mace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>think this through: its not v comman, but there are Druids that are shapeshifted most of the time. for them, this mace is certifiably a must have: not only does it afford a nice Sta and str bonus (good for dire bear), but whenever they're attack they deal 5 back automattically (combined with thorns, not nice). would also be interesting to see if the fireball proc would work in bear/cat form, tho i doubt it.<br /><br />and thank god a hunter can't use it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I expected much better for a legendary weapon, maybe it is artifact to open lower silthius, Bonereavers Edge minimum and maximum damage output PWNs this Sulfurias for instant damage abilities like Overpower and Retaliation and it also drops off Ragnaros. Why Blizz Why, its SOOO hard to make and complete and u make it Blah compared to the best Epic Sword, yes the 3.0 speed helps in soloing making for higher DPS but the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM damage is just not worth all the effort.....this is looking at the pure damage of Bonereaver 206-310 or something. Here is the link on Alla..<a href="/classic/item=17076/bonereavers-edge">Bonereaver's Edge</a> other input/opinion on Sulfurias, perhaps it is for lower Silthius because I believe Nefarius will be somewhere in Blackrock mountain due to the UBRS appearance.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Firstly, these comments you guys make; are pointless and stupid, but there are some relevant comments (thanks to te more &quot;mature crowd&quot; of this game).<br /><br />Secondly, there is no &quot;specific class&quot; set to this weapon, so it's avaidable to everyone.<br /><br />A clever, non-greedy guild would hand this to their most online, best tank first (warrior I would suppose, or to some extent a paladin). Then the next one that is created will be distributed evenly amongst the other tanks.<br /><br />If there is an abundance of this item being created within the guild, Spreading it to paladins and shamans isn't bad.<br /><br />Also, considering the druids that are Feral Talented built, the huge DPS would help for that kind of build and the resistance for Dueling mages for instance...<br /><br />The priority of this weapon, in my opinion, follows :<br /><br />1-Warrior<br />2-Paladin<br />3-Druid (Feral Talented)<br />4-Shaman<br />5-Druid(Non-Feral Talented)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>weaponDPS = (weaponMin + weaponMax) / 2 / weaponSpeed<br /><br />So, let's put this math into use. We'll use 750AP (Weak PvP Gear)<br /><br />Arcanite Reaper:<br /><br />(153 + 256) / 2 / 3.8 = 53.8157894..etc<br />(53.8157894 + 750 / 14) * 3.8 = 408.0714<br /><br />Sulfuras:<br /><br />(180 + 303) / 2 / 3.0 = 80.5 (we'll come back to this)<br />(80.5 + 750 / 14) * 3 = 402.2142<br /><br />Wow, look at that. AR hits harder. Now, when you factor in total auto-attacks and MS over a set period, Sulfuras will out-damage AR. It's an 80 freaking DPS weapon. But, on a single attack or MS, AR will outdamage it. You would need too much attack power to match reaper in a swing. I'd also take +5% crit over this, as something better is bound to pop up sometime.<br /><br />And mace spec blows. Also about .00000001% of all warriors will even see this weapon for now.<br /><br />Edited, Wed May 4 20:23:23 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just thought i should clear his up as there seems to be a lot of confusion about the sulfuron hammer and sulfuras itself<br /><br />1) the sulfuron hammer is bind on equip. yes, this means it can be sold at auction, though if you're guild can make this, chances are the first one will be given to the warrir/palladin/shaman/druid in your guild that won the roll on...<br /><br />2) the eye of sulfuras. one of 4 known legendry items. this is bind on pick-up, so the eye cannot be traded. it has no use except for being the second component, in addition to the sulfuron hammer, needed to make the only legendry weapon currently around:<br /><br />3) Sulfuras,Hand of Ragnaros. only 2 in existance, both bind on pickup. 1 is on the live realm shattered hand, owned by an alliance palladin, the second is on a US test realm where multi-copying was carried out for the ingots. this hammer is bind on pickup, which is why if a non 2-handed hammer user rolled the eye, there would be a lot of very unhappy people in that raid...<br /><br />So, the most powerful hammer in the game has only been made on 1 live server (lets face it, the test realms do not really count). i personally do not want to discuss which class this hammer suits best, except that, as procs don't work in shapeshift, it is of no use to a druid AT THE MOMENT.<br /><br />Zantetsuken, Warlord of Shadow Moon on Ragnaros, PvP EU, horde (a priest blacksmith)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone find it strange the paladin pictured at the top of this page has been through Molten Core enough times to gain 9 Sulfuron Ingots (8 if he got someone to make Sulfuron Hammer for him) and the Eye of Sulfuras from Ragnaros - yet is still covered from head to foot in lightforge armor? You'd have thought with ALL those trips through Molten Core he'd have picked up a few Lawbringer pieces by now? :)<br /><br />Anyway, I have started the long, drawn out process of collecting for my Sulfuras (I am a level 60 paladin). Have all the arcanite and most of the trivial stuff. Have 2 Sulfuron Ingots so far (from about 10 golemagg kills, still haven't figured the true drop rate yet). Our guild killed Ragnaros twice now - no Eye of Sulfuras yet. Wonder which is harder to get - the Eye, or the 9 sulfuron ingots at the reputed 10% drop rate from Golemagg?<br /><br />Can anyone who has killed Golemagg many many times give a better indication of the true drop-rate? By my calculations if you kill Golemagg and Ragnaros once per week - you'd get 4 Eye of Sulfuras for every 8 Sulfuron Ingots - at 10% drop rate on the ingots which doesn't seem right. I got 2 from 10 kills so maybe 20%/25% is somewhere nearer?<br /><br />A horde guild on are server got Sulfuras a few weeks back (they were lucky enough to get the Eye of Sulfuras on their 2nd Ragnaros kill!:). I think they borrow a couple of ingots from another horde guild - but 7 ingots is still a lot to get since may April time when they started doing MC - so I reckon the drop-rate is higher than 10%</div>

Can a revered armorsmith trek down and turn in an ingot in exchange for the plans to make the first hammer? Thanks. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Definitely a Paladin weapon *FLAME HAT ON*<br /><br />Seriously though both me and a guild mate have this mace on Arathor (EU)<br /><br /><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v58/siwrx/CamNemSulf.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v58/siwrx/CamNemSulf.jpg</a><br /><br />The mace can't be vendored by the way. It has no sell price and it can't be DE'd either. Not sure if this has always been the case as it does say it has a vendor price in the above stats, but since Ive had it it hasn't been sellable.<br /><br />To get it you need to make the Sulfuran hammer (recipe of which is bought off the TB for 1 Sulfuran ingot). This hammer takes a shed load of stuff including 8 10% drop Sulfuran ingots off Gole. You then click the eye you get off Ragnaros and they instantly combine and the hammer appears in your inventory (I had sulfuran equipped and it unequipped when sulfuras was created)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So I finally got this weapon last week on Windrunner (yes i'm a paladin retribution spec please hold your flame post). Everytime I come to allakhazam I check any CONSTRUCTIVE post on this weapon, ie about the proc etc but find little information. So here is my conclusion on the Sulfuras after a week of testing:<br /><br />- The proc rate is about 10-12% (but can peak to 25% its very unstable)and crits up to 500+ plus the additional 75 damage over 10 seconds.<br /><br />- The fireball does have a RARE chance to proc TWICE IN ONE SWING! Yes I've seen it happen once when I've been monitoring my combat log. This doesn't mean it has a proc on the physical hit, and the SOC hit because I've had 2 fireballs hit a target without the SOC proc going off.<br /><br />- Molten Core bosses (except Baron Gadden, Ragnaros) do fall victim to the Sulfuras fireball proc. Molten Giants / Destroyers too. Firelords are immune.<br /><br />- The animation binding the Eye of Sulfuras to the Sulfuron Hammer sucks.<br /><br />So to anyone interested in this weapon down the road I hope this bit of information helps. It takes a lot of hard work to get this weapon, and a bit of luck on the drop rates.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Oct 1 16:32:47 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok I've been looking at this item's stats once in a while to show or tell other people... and I always end up reading what some pretty pathetic people have to say. So I thought I'd express my feelings and clarify some things.<br /><br />I know I might be wrong since I dont always fully read patch notes but there's always &quot;IF&quot; when I'm not sure so feel free to correct me.<br /><br />FIRST OFF<br />---------<br /><br />A little test for all you druids out there (IF this wasn't changed in the lastest patches) Take a 1-handed weapons, shapeshift, note your damage on a piece of paper. Then, take a staff (both weapons without +STR), shift, compare your damage with the numbers on your paper. Did it change? No, because your damage is not based on your weapons. You also don't proc while shifted... So pleaaaaase tell me WHYYYYYYYY is this a Druid weapon? Thank you.<br /><br />SECONDLY<br />--------<br /><br />Have you ever made a paladin? (directed to anyone saying this is &quot;NOT AT ALL OMG&quot; a paladin weapon)<br />Because, if you did, you'd realize that the only... ONLY source of damage of a paladin is with its weapon or triggered holy damage BASED on your weapon. (yes I know some people will tell me well you can Judge SoC and still make damage !1!11!11!1!) But again this fact is based on someone that's not retarded. So... to OWN a lot with a paladin you need an awesome weapon.... got that?<br /><br />So to conclude, I'd say that this is a weapon for mostly paladins, EDIT: Enhancement Shammies and DPS Warriors, and if your guild has an general IQ of over 10, they wont let a druid lotto on the eye for Sulfuras.<br /><br />Reply your comments or email them to kirzan@gmail.com, because you know I care :)<br /><br />Edited, Tue Jan 24 16:04:59 2006</div>

I've beaten a paladin on my server known as &quot;Chrisa&quot; whos on spirestone with all the good epic gear from MC she has full lawbringer, quick strike, onyixa tooth pendent, you get the idea the damnge crap. (Im horde btw) Then &quot;Draz&quot; who has Eshankerds collor and alot of other epic gear, not sure on the names atm. I usually win with 1-2.5k life left. It mainly depends on how much it procs =\<br /><br />Now in all honesty, I feel niether War, Pal, Druid are good enough for it. I think it would set shamans the best. Why? Simply because Wind Fury.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Nice weapon.. Especially with the revised stats (223-372 Damage Speed 3.70) Although I am a Paladin, I have to agree, this could be best put to use by a Warrior. At the same time, this <i>would</i> make a Paladin able to hold thier own for DPS...<br />I would suggest that this item be looted only by whoever (of the two classes) could currently afford to have the hammer crafted... 160 dark iron ore, 50 arcanite bars, 25 essence of fire, 10 blood of the mountain, 10 fiery core, 10 lava core, 8 sulfuron ignots... On my server this comes to AH prices of about 4500-6500 gold, 8 sulfuron ignots (never seen 'em in the AH) and about 3-6 months to catch these items at reasonable prices...<br /><br />Ask yourself... Is this really something I would *honestly* be able to afford? Is this really worth that much to me? If the answer is yes, ... by all means, roll on the eye.<br /><br />(Honestly, if anyone other than a warrior or paladin rolls on the eye, their accounts should be subject to deletion, and they should be forced to play kiddie-strike for the next 20 years)</div>

This is the ultimate paladin weapon in game. Nice &amp; slow weapon &amp; an awsome dmg range.<br />The fireball can proc on both normal &amp; seal of command dmg on the same weapon swing. So with a little luck you can get 3k dmg in one hit witch is really nice in combo with a paladins survival posiblity's.<br /><br />So... warriors get Askhandi &amp; keep your hands of keke? :)<br /><br />HoR &gt; Askhandi for paladins. For all you DPS hookers... it's not about DPS. It's still about max weapon dmg, even after the speed normalisation. Seal of Command is on a proc/min rate so weather you have a 3.00 or a 3.80speed weapon it procs the same amount of times/minute. When it procs you want it to do much dmg so you need high top-end dmg... ;)<br /><br />Edited, Thu Mar 9 18:24:30 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1.) This is the best 2 hand weapon in the game plain and simple<br /><br />2.) Droan you should be shot for saying that, even sarcastically =P<br /><br />Anyway, the reason number 1 is true is becuase of the absolutely massive DPS on this. Although it is faster than the reaper it still has a massively higher base damage (180-302 compared with 153-256) which means in insta attacks (which go off of base) this will absolutely own. Basically this weapon hits faster than the reaper (almost 3/4 of the speed) and it will hit for more each hit. There is no reason why, given the choice, anyone in their right mind should choose the reaper.</div>

After all, if u have a druid in ur raid, who did some huge amount of work, to get u to raggy, than ofcourse he may deserve it.<br /><br />In the end it doesnt matter who get it, as long its a trusworthy member and someone who is worth to wear it. Even with the eye (3,15%) and the 8-9 ingots, u still need help from ur guild, to get the 20 cores. The rest u can farm on ur own....So after all, its the work of many peoples...<br /><br />Gratz whoever got this baby, u did surely some big effort, otherwise u wouldnt wear it.<br /><br />Kocmoc</div>

Not that it isn't awesome for any of the above -- just absurdly difficult to obtain the mats; not to mention a bit of luck.<br /><br />Paladin/Shaman would rock with this - but would generally be touting a 1h/Shield in PVE for pure stats reasons -- but would love this for PVP action. As a Druid - personally I'd want the Lava Dredger - but of course wouldn't mind this either. Warriors I hear nothing but complaints on how &quot;mace spec is seriously lacking&quot; -- but also hear that this would make it worth it. Pretty sad that it would take a legendary for that, imo.<br /><br />Oh, and does anyone else find it interesting that the pally in the picture above is wearing full Lightforge save for the Judgement Crown and Leggings?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Raijinmeister</b></h3>These posts saying this weapon is &quot;trash&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; for dps warriors make me laugh so hard. <br /><br />I have this beauty and the <a href="/classic/item=17076/bonereavers-edge">Bonereaver's Edge</a> and the hammer is a damn nuke compared to everything I had used before.<br /><br />I bet most of these comments were made by people that don't even put their hands on a damn Thunderstrike.</div>
