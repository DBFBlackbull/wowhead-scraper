<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zipmint</b></h3>You can get better herbs from these if you have +150 herbalism (I though it was just speculation but it is actually true and it is in 1.3 patch notes). If the have high enough herbalism you don't get lowest level herbs anymore and you get higher level herbs and more of them too. Also it seems to work so that the loot in the casings is determined when you open them so you can make bunch of casings while leveling herbalism and open them when you have over 150 skill and you will get better loot from them.</div>
