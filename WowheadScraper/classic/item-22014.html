It is simply an item you must purchase and have to finish the quest for the Helm and Chest for the 0.5 set.\n\nThere you go.\n\nPersonally I'd be more worried about all the other junk you have to do than 120g, but that's just me.","date":"2006-04-04T20:36:43-05:00","rating":34,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"spikeykitten","importedSubject":"just the facts"},{"commentv2":1,"number":4,"id":2711446,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Does anyone know if this item is a single charge, or cooldown?\n\nIs it consumed after 1 summon?&nbsp; I purchased 1 for use in my .5 armor chain, but I also want to farm for my Relic.&nbsp;","date":"2006-04-04T20:36:43-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"nzajex","importedSubject":"Hallowed Brazier"},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":2711457,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"This set is for the people who don't have the time to do MC and BWL every week.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's for the .5 armor sets questlines.&nbsp; Do not buy this unless you're doing the quest line, otherwise it's just a waste of gold.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Now that we got the crying about how much does it cost out of the way. What does it do?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok so you've discussed the fact that this may or may not be worth the money. Thats very nice. <br /><br />Now for some information on the item.<br /><br />The fourth and final stage of the 0.5 set requires it. <br /><br />(this is a quote from the wiki site that has previously been posted)<br /><br />some NPC somewhere gives you a quest called...<br /><br />&quot;Three Kings of Flame&quot; which requires you to collect 1 Incindicite of Incendius, 1 Ember of the Emberseer, 1 Cinder of Cynders, and 1 Hallowed Brazier. Do get these, you have to kill Incendius in BRD, Emberseer in UBRS, The Duke of Cynders in Silithus, and obtain honored with the Argent Dawn to buy a Hallowed Brazier (120gold) from an Argent Dawn Quartermaster.<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Ok so now we know what it is for. It is simply an item you must purchase and have to finish the quest for the Helm and Chest for the 0.5 set.<br /><br />There you go.<br /><br />Personally I'd be more worried about all the other junk you have to do than 120g, but that's just me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know if this item is a single charge, or cooldown?<br /><br />Is it consumed after 1 summon?&nbsp; I purchased 1 for use in my .5 armor chain, but I also want to farm for my Relic.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This set is for the people who don't have the time to do MC and BWL every week. They can just quest and pay a sum of money and recieve epics. Basically, you could say this is for the casual gamer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK so i'm not i interested in doing my Tier .5 quests how ever i am interested in Slapping Kormok a couple of times for that tasty +def ring he drops. I am assuming you can use/buy this even when not on the quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i dont know about anyone else, but i find that these items are crucial to any feral spec'd druid.&nbsp; We have to ninja shadowcraft from rogues, which pisses them off to no end.<br /><br />And since the tier 0, 1, 2 are all balance/resto gear, the only thing druids have to look forward to is either the pvp gear, or tier 3 genesis&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />Yea have fun farming honor or rep with the brood.<br /><br />It is definetly worth the 120g for any feral spec'd drood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't have a probelm doing this quest chain at all really. The guild I am in is fairly new and we are still trying to create a solid foundation before we start raiding. We do all guild UBRS runs every week and do ZG with another guild on the weekends but thats pretty much it. So since I don't get the opportunity to get my Cenarion or Stormrage sets like alot of you do, for now the Feralheart is great for me. Yea its time consuming and gold consuming as well but when you have free time on your hands from not raiding it gives ya something to do :) I hear alot of people /cry about the gold it takes to do this whole chain and I admit it can be daunting at times. But really think about it. Gold is easy to come by at level 60. You get gold just for doing quests (Thanks for that Blizz.) And herbalism makes a good profit on my server if you don't need all your herbs for those flasks and pots you mostly need in big raids hehe. So for all you Stormrage wearing BWL raiding peeps congrats on your accomplishments...For now I'll marvel at my Feralheart set and be happy just the same.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hakkar is one of the easiest bosses there are for the kind of loot he drops. You just need to follow the already established working tactics. That counts for any boss, but hakkar is something you can farm with ease. <br /><br />I myself was fortunate to know alot of players that were lvl 60 before I even started playing, so 3 days after I reached 60 I already took my first steps in MC. Got 3 epics: 'Fire Runed Grimoire' 'Arcanist Gloves' 'Ring of Spellpower'. I only did the 0.5 quest's first part to get the bracers. Since I already have the tier 1 parts, I will not be doing the belt/gloves part of the tier 0.5 quest because it's way too expensive for something I will never use.<br /><br />For the non-raiding gamer, these quests are great. They are blizzard's answer for the people not in a position to raid, or do not have time to raid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1. The dungeon set is worthless, i think everyone acknowledges that.<br />2. Many tier .5 pieces are VERY good, esp compared to tier 1. Chest and helm pieces in particular.<br />3. Set piece bonuses are reveresed, so the 8 pc bonus is given with only 2 pieces of the upgrade. For some classes this is useless, but for most being able to get the final set bonus with only 2 is very very good.<br /><br />The fact that you can upgrade a worthless set to some usable epics, even if you use just 1 or 2 from the set, makes this upgrade chain VERY worthwhile.<br />I have mostly bwl class epics and a few tier 1, and im using many from this set to fill in and give my equipment some variety. <br /><br />Also the qwests on this line are different enuff from yer normal grinding stuff that its actually quiet fun. 45 min baron, ecto collection have been some of the more fun things ive done in WOW. Most of the grinding qwests are duoable if not solable. Any excuse to run some of the five mans again is a good one for me.<br /><br />well worth it imho.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>anyone know if its price changes based on your rep?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Your comments are all valid and insightful, but the whole point about playing this game is having fun, and in my opinion, and being a casual player, or a Noob as some of you might call me, raiding is not that fun. I enjoy 5 and 10 man groups a lot more than a 20 or 40 man raids because if you are not in a big enough guild it is very hard to get 20 &amp; 40 60's together. <br />The .5 armor tier questline is very enjoyable, not to mention the fact that you built a lot of rep with the AD by trying to get your leggings from the damn Baron (which is probably the most tedious of all the steps). I'm currently on the final stages of the quest (the helm and breastplate) and i should be done with it by the end of this week if i could find 10 ppl willing to do Valthalak.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a dps warrior in a guild that farm MC. And imo tier 0.5 for warrior has a lot of good items for a dps warrior. The helm, brestplate and boots rocks. I've been farmin MC for 3 mnts now and nothing have dropped that could replace those 3 items i mentioned above, for a dps warrior. So indeed well worth the gold you spend.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those who think the t0.5 quest line is a waste of time any money...&nbsp; What you fail to realize is that you become capable of summoning guys that do more than just complete your quests, they drop items specific to them.&nbsp; Although you may not benifit directly from these items, a druid friend or one in your guild would love to get the and many cloth wearers find the Ironweave set appealing do to the sharp increase in armor they suddenly receive.&nbsp; These are just some examples of people who benifit.&nbsp; Most people skip the t0.5 line because they think it is a waste of time...&nbsp; Sure, the pvp sets are better in many ways... but the t0.5 opens many doors that were entirely closed before.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The whole point of t0.5 that most of you people don't seem to get is that it represents a significant accomplishment. Anyone can go have a cup of tea while their character stands still and farms honor all day. And as a part of a 40-man raid, regardless of your skill level, it's more about being in the right place at the right time and not screwing up the run for yourself and everyone else. To me, the 0.5 chain represents the ultimate individual challenge in the game. And if you finish it, you're going to have something unique. This chain really seperates the men from the boys, as it were. The sense of accomplishment here is the real reward. Not to mention, you're looking at about 100 hours of BG grinding to get the 6-piece epic set, not counting time spent waiting, and assuming you always win and/or get a high score.<br /><br />As for the item itself, once you get to this part of the chain, part 19 of 29, you have 6/8 of your set and grinding twilight cultists will have driven you insane. You'll drop 120g on this thing without hesitation. This quest, mentally I think, is the point of no return. You will under no circumstances give up this chain once you've downed the duke of cinders. If it were 10,000g, you'd find a way to pay it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Here I thought &quot;oh, .5 dungeon sets will be GREAT for everyone who can't get core in an MC group. What a fantastic idea blizz!<br /><br />Well, unfortunatly, it's easier to get a core spot over the course of a month than it is to get this BS.<br /><br />120g for the Brazier? I mean come on. Epics aren't supposed to be easy to come by but all this does is keep the gold farmers in business.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>afaik, this is needed for druids to get their Idol of Rejuv</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ya, I just bought one not looking at the price, I'm an idiot, anyway to get my 133g back?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Don't believe his crap, this is for the tier 0.5 end quest. (for the chest etc.)<br /><br />The last quest requires you to kill Incendius in BRD, kill Emberseer in UBRS, and kill The Duke of Cynders in Silithus and buy a Hallowed Brazier(120gold) from a Argent Dawn Quartermaster with the required reputation of Honored.</div>
