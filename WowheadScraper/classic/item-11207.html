I know for sure im getting +15 agi off hand and money is not an issue. I am also considering getting +15 agi main hand as well but that is not as likely. Does anyone know how much dmg it procs for on a 29?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have weapons with Demonslaying, Icy chill, Fiery Weapon.&nbsp; Demonslaying goes off now and then and it is helpful, Icy Chill is useless as can be as it goes off once every 6 fights for me and it only lasts for 5 seconds.&nbsp; Now Fiery Weapon is incredible, it will go off 3-6 times in a fight for me w/ my 2handed mace (Twig of the wood Tree) and it will hit for 20-60 damaga with a nice little explosion.&nbsp; It is NOT an aoe like some people have thought, it only does direct damage to your target.&nbsp; Hitting for an extra 120-240 damgage in a fight is definately worth the buff!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After 1.10 we farmed this guy.&nbsp; He was there every time for 12 runs, but didn't drop until 12th.&nbsp; Since he used to be 1/5 chance to be there and 1/3 chance to drop, I'm guessing the droprate has probably changed to 1/15.<br /><br />He is farmable with 2 ppl - we did it with 60 mage &amp; 60 shammie, using 1 lesser invis pot each per run.&nbsp; You come into instance, go short way (neeed key to doors) and either fight or avoid first 2 fiery guards.&nbsp; The ring of Law is the tricky bit, as depending on where the spectators spawn you might pull them.&nbsp; Left side seems to be best in general - just stick close to wall and most times you'll be fine. Use the pots to get past the 2 groups after that, and if you come out of stealth just under the flag on the left hand side of hall in front of him you won't aggro. Short way out is to unequip all your stuff and die, then reset instance.&nbsp; Enjoy :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>holy crap! this thing procs all day long! take it from a twink own who was too poor for anything else. my 10-19 twink dual wields fiery on pearl-handled daggers :) even w/ those crappy daggers DPS (like 11.5 or somethin') i can still take other twinks down (can usually take about half life w/ 1 ambush). anyway i guess my point is this is a great enchant...but +15 agi would be nice to off-hand</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried to enchant Blade of the Titans with Fiery, cause I use Whirlwind alot as lvl44 warrior.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried farm this Formula in two servers.<br /><br />1. lv.62 hunter with non-epic, only TBC gears with cat (non-FR) <br /><br />Opened three doors w/key, passed the flame guard on patrol. (or we fight it, it is easy with lv.62), passed the spectators area with no problem.&nbsp; Dismiss pet. <br />At 5 mobs in group x 2, I could not pass through without aggro, so go through without fighting and FD'd just before the Pyromancer group. Get the pet out and back to full health and mana.<br />Get the pet enrage (I'm BM), just focus on Pyromancer. Pet is neary dying with dots from two casters by the time the main guy died, so I quickly loot, go back to non-aggro distance and FD. Get naked and suicide into the mob. Back to the instance portal, rez and reset and try again.<br />I got the Formula in the third run.<br /><br />2. lv.65 hunter with some T2 epic still remained on, the rest is TBC gear. lv. 64 Cat with FR.<br />This was very easy.&nbsp; Being 65, I was able to pass ALL mobs (even 2 x 5 mobs group) by hugging the wall with pet stealthed. Focus on the pyromancer, but pet still had enough health after the fight, so I took two adds down with no problem.&nbsp; Pretty easy fight.&nbsp; I got the formula in the second run.<br /><br />So I guess the drop rate isn't so bad. These hunters are on different servers.&nbsp; By lv.65 you can easily farm this without ever getting aggro from any other mobs.<br /><br />So GL to you all</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this on on my Blackhand Doomsaw and it seems to proc almost every hit. I'd say there's about 75-80% chance for it to proc. A regular hit will cause 40 fire damage, a critical one 60. I don't know which ability is the key ability for weapon crits, but I'd assume it's agility. With about 300 agility I'd say the chance for a crit is about 20%. <br />It's a rather cheap enchantment and a good choice if you want to save some money from those crusader enchantments ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was in a 1 rogue 1 druid group, got it 2nd drop along with the wand. We passed, then rolled and I died before I could loot. Not sure if a druid could solo him cause he has 2 mobs. Might try to get another enchant and sell it cause it sells well on my server. BTW his spawn is a % per instance not on a timer b/c it's an instance so it can't be timed or everyone would get it. I just got lucky</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Cruisader and fiery enchants are considered to be the best. However, why wouldn't a +9 to impact be better than fiery? Fiery does 40 dmg per proc approx every 10th to 12th swing. With the +9 enchant that would be 90 dmg to 108 dmg. Seems like the +9 would be better than Fiery. Opinions?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hi, <br />The character I put this on is a Night Elf Druid, then Level 27. I had my Magician's Staff of Spirit enchanted with Fiery Weapon. I've been deliberatily engaged in non-feral combat the past few days against mobs my own level (up to +2) and I can say that this enchant is pretty nifty. I still rely on my casting to initially set the stage, but this actually fires-off (I guess the coined term is 'proc') no less than 1 out every 4-5 hits from my staff. Pretty nifty! I'll be sad to loose it and have to reenchant another staff as I level up. Oh, I'm a noob to WoW. You guys are pretty informative. Thanks,</div>
