I had about 3-5 drop in one hour of non-stop raptor killing/skinning. This is a nice money making item, especially if you for over a few more gold and craft a Deviate Scale Belt, you can make even more money.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3419</b></h3>Average price for Perfect Deviate Scales on the AH can range from 1 to 2 gold for each scale -- stacks of 20 = 20g<br /><br />The reason for this is that they are a key component for the Deviate Scale Belt ( <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6468">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6468</a> ), and have a rather low drop rate for skinners.<br /><br />Example: One run through WC equaled about 8 perfect scales total.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>27308</b></h3>if your grinding the scales... i highly recommending selling them in the form of deviate scale belts... where a stack of 20 scales goes about 20-40g (depends on server) - the belts go for around 25g (from what ive seen pretty common price), and for every stack, u get just over 3 belts (ull get enough deviate scales from the grinding neways).<br />also, on terms of g/hour u can expect... i was just grinding 2 belts for 2 twinks i have ^.^ it took just 1hour30mins... i was using my level 39 (non twinked) rogue, as a method of earning fast money, this is a good way for skinners/LWs to get their level 40 mounts. if i was selling i could expect around 35-40g/hour for that lot.<br />hf grinding =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You don't have to be a skinner to get the deviate scales or the perfect deviate scales. I was able to get both with my lvl 60 druid who is not a skinner. I was farming these for my lower lvl rogue who is a leatherworker. Drop rates aren't that great for the perfect deviate scale. I left WC with 15 deviate scales and 1 perfect deviate scale. Unfortunately I think it's just a matter of having a lot of patience to keep farming.&nbsp; On a side note, you have to be a skinner to get those whelp scales in Redridge. Probably why someone thought you had to be a skinner for these deviate things.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dont bother trying to farm these guys if you arnt a skinner.<br /><br />Yes its possible to get them without skinning, but you have a chance to get them when you skin them as well.<br /><br />However its worth it in the long run, twinks eat these belts up in the AH&nbsp; ---&gt; 50g a pop, if not more.&nbsp; I think they raised the drop rate some.&nbsp; I dont go inside WC, i just farm on the outside.<br /><br />Average 3 per time I clear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How many runs will it take with skinning to get 10 deviate scales and 10 perfict deviate scales?...Is the belt on AH worth the effort trying to get the scales?...How much does it sell for on average?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This belt is eaten up by twinks.&nbsp; I put on AH and literally a minute later I sold it for 70g!&nbsp; Only took me 2 runs of WC to get the scales and I made another 5g from selling the rest of my regular scales.&nbsp; Just tough it out u wont regret it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>okay just looking at the drop chances on these things is crazy i mean im not sure if its worth my time for just to make a about 15-20g belt</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Personaly, I ran WC once skinning everything and came out with 6 perfect and about 15 regular.&nbsp; Then went back and farmed near the entrance for the remaining 4 regular in about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Talk about luck, one deviate I killed dropped a perfect and a regular and skinned for a second perfect :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, it's true that grinding this instance is a pain.&nbsp; You do only end up with one or two Perfect Deviate Scales per run of the intance.&nbsp; Some runs, I left with NO scales, but other times two or three.<br /><br />I would recommend just doing the first portion with the raptors which is where I found the majority of the Perfect Scale.&nbsp; Took me about 25 minutes per run in Bear form with my L43 Druid.&nbsp; Exit, reset the instance and go again.<br /><br />It should be noted that while the Perfect Scale will turn the most profit, the instance is loaded with green drops that sell for about 50s each at the AH.&nbsp; May not seem like much, but with all my traveler's backpacks I was full of green items after three or four runs.&nbsp; If you leave with 50 green items for the AH, you can turn a 25g profit just on the drops.&nbsp; Some items you may be tempted to destroy, such as the shoulders off the boss druid which are white, but they still fetch about 1g88s at auction - so hold onto them.<br /><br />It can be a grind, but a profitable one if you have the patience.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>…I rather enjoyed the grind of getting these scales. As a lv49 Hunter, it was simplicity to run WC. My pet can tank 8-9 mobs with ease, probably 12-15 if he could hold aggro better.<br /><br />In one run, I walked out with 15 greens, 7 Perfect Deviat Scales, 32 Deviate Scales, 5 stacks of Light Leather, and 8 stacks of Medium Leather (I combined all the leather into Heavy Leather to save inventory space, though.)<br /><br />I just trashed all the grays, not worth it for me to run out of the instance everytime my inventory filled up.</div>

Just gone through again, and only 5. As I'm Alliance, these never come up on the AH, so I'll have to go back again to make the belt. Sigh.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Jan 29 20:14:47 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So, why is is my level 32 Tauren Druid (balance) with skinning (that only gets leather from these mobs) has picked up 3 (as drops) before the first hallway?<br /><br />Odd.<br /><br />I have the pattern, but I'm probably not going to learn it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate on these seem to have gone up by a long ways, I received twelve of these in one run. Of course I was doing most of all the skinning, but still, I made two belts with that.<br /><br />And also, the amount needed to make the belt seems to have dropped, I remember it being ten (if that is correct...) and now it is six.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Providing you're a skinner, the drop rate isn't <i>too</i>awful. I normally get about six or seven on a run through WC (solo), provided I skin everything.<br /><br />You get very few dropping on the corpses though. Probably one per run at best</div>
