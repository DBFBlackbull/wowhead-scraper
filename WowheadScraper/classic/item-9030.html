It's great for debuff intensive fights like Chromaggus in Blackwing Lair, as well as in PvP against classes that use Damage Over Times.<br /><br />The only downside is the use of your potion cooldown, but still well worth it in many situations.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10501</b></h3>Quest reward. After you complete the quest, talk to him again (he's upstairs in the inn at Kargath) and he will give you Badlands Reagent Run II.<br /><br />Then you'll get the recipe</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this stuff is great, drops the sap, kills warlocks and priests main damages</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Rare because people are lazy and eaither haven't completed the quest chain or dosen't realize how good this potion is.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i tried several times to pick up the quest, one of the posts (either on thott or allakhazam) says you need high herbalism.<br /><br />the requirements for the quest are level 40, and 225 alchemy. there might be an herb requirement too, but you definitely need 225 alchemy.<br /><br />you get this after finding the mushrooms around the uldaman instance.<br /><br />the quests are:<br /><br />horde <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3492">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3492</a><br /><br />alliance <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2501/badlands-reagent-run-ii">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2501/badlands-reagent-run-ii</a><br /><br />they're not as hard as they seem, the vials you need have a fast cast time, and if you leave yourself someplace to run to or vanish you can do it as fast as the cooldown. you don't have to weaken or kill the mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunters, note that this will clean the artorius's curse for our epic quest, so it can help a lot in this fight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is one of the most useful pots to have on you. It's on a separate timer from combat pots (healing/rage/etc) and does work in combat.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anybody know if these work on the stuff chromaggus throws at you?
