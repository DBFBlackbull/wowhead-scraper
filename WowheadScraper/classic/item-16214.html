<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Akgis</b></h3>As patch 2.0.3 this can now be trained from the Enchanting Trainer inside Uldaman, no more need to farm for a 1% drop rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25578</b></h3>You can also train it in Shattrah. The trainer in the Scryer base has it, not sure for Aldors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm starting to wonder if it might have been moved, or even taken out.&nbsp; I've camped it for over 14 hours now.&nbsp; I'd say I've killed 200 to 250 Shadowcasters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finally got it.&nbsp; Yeah, it's still off the Shadowcasters.&nbsp; Finally dropped toward the end of hour 15.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>took me 175 casters to get it.<br /><br />hopefully i can sell the enchant for a bit of profit and make some money</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes! It does drop even in the 1.4.0.2 patch. Actually I went to Hinterlands specifically for this recipe, and the first Shadow Caster I killed, did drop this recipe!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me ~76 shadow casters. It's fairly easy for a level 60 druid to solo this. Just cat form prowl around to them with Track Humanoids on. Pounce, shred, rake, scratch, rake when the first one runs out, then rip. If you are low on HP, switch out and heal then finish him off and his pet. If not, do another couple scratches, then ferocious bite when he starts to run away. Be sure to get him before he aggros a Vilebrance Berserker!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Been churning these damn things for days now. As near as i can figure im up to about 600 shadowcasters dead for no formula. Did get some glove tailoring formula and a few greens but thats it.<br /><br />Lvl 60 doesnt agro unless you walk up and almost shake hands. Shadowcasters are easy for shamans, but the berserkers can be a little nasty with the occasional crit for up to 450 or so, but most hits being about 100-150 when im using a 2h axe (so my ac is lower).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>60 undead shadow priest, had very few problems soloing the shadowcasters and avoiding the berserkers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I spent 7 days farming for this for an hour or so at a time.&nbsp; I probably killed 250 shadowcasters before I got the enchant, but in the meantime several greens and two valuable blues dropped (Guttbuster and Swortshord of Vengeance), and the cash flowed nicely.&nbsp; Definitely worth 10-15 hours of grinding!<br /><br />Oh, and for those who need this enchant, I'll do it for 10g (price includes mats) on Earthen Ring.&nbsp; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Vilebranch Shadow Casters are the target took awhile but got it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I spent ~12 hours (3 seperate 3-5 hours sessions) killing ~600 shadowcasters (estimation) before it dropped. I very much doubt that 1.2% is accurate. Based on my experience, and others, ~0.2-0.5% would seem more likely.<br /><br />-Duskhide (exhausted, but finally happy)<br /><br />(Oh, btw, I can make this on Earthen Ring, horde ;))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You go up the first stairs, turn left, up the next stairs..along to the end and there are the shadow casters...problem is, you'll nearly always aggro a berserker when they run off in fear when near death.&nbsp; A very difficult recipe to get.<br /><br />Anyone know if there are a batch of the shadow casters anywhere else at all as this area has too many of other types for my liking!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I wanted someone to enchant my bracers with +7int, but no one seemed to be able to do it.&nbsp; Then I found out why - cos the formula is so bloody rare.&nbsp; So I decided to go farm for the formula myself.&nbsp; It dropped after the 8th kill! :))&nbsp; I thought I would give it to someone for free if they done the enchant for me in exchange.&nbsp; Then I found out how much it is worth!<br /><br />Formula is now in the AH, all I gotta do now is wait for someone to buy it, then get them to do the enchant for me.<br /><br />I'm happy now!<br /><br />Edit:I thought I'd go back and farm for another because it was a good money maker.&nbsp; Jeez!&nbsp; I was definately lucky the first time - This time I've killed loads of the bastards, and no joy.&nbsp; yet...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Must be my lucky day dropped off the first shadowcaster i killed.&nbsp; now to sell or not to sell</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got it after about 6 or 7 kills.&nbsp; I learned it then checked it out at the AH and it's going for 300g on Arthas. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Vilebranch Shadowcasters spawn only on one platform as you climb the temple.&nbsp; There are about nine spawn points, they always spawn in the same spots.&nbsp; I'm a Feral Druid, so it's easy for me to sneak around and kill them quickly.&nbsp; I do it in a line and return back to the start and wait for them to start respawning.&nbsp; Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />A 1% drop rate isn't fun, but for a level 60 they are easy to kill.&nbsp; You may end up killing a couple hundred like I did until you finally get your's to drop.&nbsp; And then, you may return like I did with the intention of farming one to sell, and getting it on the first drop...<br /><br />The formulas are rare, and few people know to farm them.&nbsp; You should have no trouble getting a fair amount of coin for it.&nbsp; If you are an ambitious enchanter like I am, then waste no time learning the formula and spamming it along with all your other enchants in the capital cities.&nbsp; The mats cost about 5g on my server.&nbsp; Don't feel guilty charging 10-15g, as with many enchants, this is not an easy formula to obtain.<br /><br /> - Exekias / Alliance / Dragonmaw</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>farmed the shadowcasters as a lvl 60 paladin while waiting for bg's and got it within 30 minutes. They drop decent silver ammounts, as well as some other random humanoid drops like scrolls &amp; cloth etc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After reading all the posts on this formula i was a bit sketchy about trying to farm this. Sells for 150-200 gold on Stormrage. If your anything like me you hate buying anything that has a possibilite of being farmed. 42 wildvine drops 500+ mageweave drops a boat load of Greens, friendly with the wildhammer clan, 11 hrs. It finnaly droped. So yes it still drops from the shadowcasters</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Farmed it in about 1H with a friend, and did not sell it (I am an enchanter).<br />this is a pretty good enchant, sells well on /2 channel.<br /><br />peace<br /><br />Crocshaitan, feathermoon, Alliance</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me about 40 mins to get it.<br /><br />Did this as a 60 rogue, they are easy to take, very.<br /><br />Anyways, u dont &quot;need&quot; stealth to take em, cuz they are about 47-49 on that place, so i moustly walked without stealth without getting agro.<br /><br />Good luck hunting, iam gonna try get another one now, since they kinda go AH for 70-100g<br />And some other guild'ies need it :)<br /><br />Bateleur, Daggerspine EU</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>guess im a bit lucky, got it off the first shadowcaster :)) /dance</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>BE PATIENT THATS THE KEY.<br /><br />While farming for it i also got <br /><br />lots of mageweave and lots of wilvine.<br /><br />so BE PATIENT! its worth it. <br /><br />i killed like around 250 shadowcasters. just do it !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been farming for this for &quot;ages&quot; and looking for it on AH for over 1 year, never seen it. Uber Rare. Then, after the last big patch, there is like 3-6 of them on AH almost every week. Sells for 100-120g on Turalyon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Over 300+ kills of these guys, still no luck (post 1.12).&nbsp; A ton of mageweave, greens, frost resistence to shield recipe, wildvine, troll mojo, and silver though, from farming these guys for it.<br /><br />Anyways... 1% drop rate... no way, especially when no one else has killed these guys while i have been there farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got lucky and one dropped on the 4th mob I killed.<br /><br />Have to say tho, even for being 47-48 (elites), these are one of the harder mobs for shadow priests to farm, due to the pet add and the shadow resistance.&nbsp; However, with shadow protection you won't take much damage from the shadowcasters themselves (if any at all).<br /><br />Also, with Shadowform and Darkness and Imp. SW:P, a single SW:P will kill the voidwalker add.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I spent over 4 days, approximately 2-3 hours a day farming for this and finally got it.. My intention was to sell it at the Auction house, I created the auction and walked away from the auctioneer and received notification that the formula sold. <br />I went back and farmed the same location again, this time to equip the formula, spent the same amount of time 2-3 hours for approx 4-5 days and it dropped again.. <br />Its a nice enchant!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got it, did like 3 spawn rounds of the shadow casters. Did it when no1 else was there so.. i'm happy ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got mine after 11 kills.. nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got it after 102 kills</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has anyone seen this drop since the 2.0 patch?&nbsp; I've been farming for 3 days now, and have had 4 &quot;Recipe: Wildvine Potion&quot;s drop (0.3%), but not a single one of these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Still hasn't dropped.&nbsp; I'm giving it one more week then giving up.&nbsp; 1 month to find this recipe, lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed this once a few patches ago, and I know I didn't have to kill more than 100 of these.<br /><br />I have now killed 140+ and no drop. I have received the Wildvine potion recipe numerous times.<br /><br />Has anyone gotten this post 2.0?<br /><br />If so, how many kills did it take you approximately, and more importantly is it still the shadowcasters (the ones with the blue warlock type pet with them).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is still there and it is the shadowcasters.&nbsp; We were there a few weeks ago and nothing.&nbsp; Went last night and it dropped on the second caster we killed.&nbsp; THEN...&nbsp; It dropped again on the third caster!&nbsp; Talk about lucky.&nbsp; I got them both and am an enchanter so it made my night!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got mine after the third clear of the shadowcasters. Took about 2 days for me in all though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got it after about 3 days (250-300 kills).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Don't listen to the people who say &quot;oh, I got it on my first kill!&quot;<br /><br />It probably won't happen to you.<br /><br />I farmed for this recipie for EIGHT HOURS. No drops.<br /><br />For the last few hours, I was teamed up with a gold farmer. I eventually gave up, and she pressed on. 45 minutes later, she send me a tell, linking the recpipe (obviously gloating). Fine. Whatever.<br /><br />An hour after that, she sent me another link. She got two in just a little under four hours.<br /><br />So it can be done. You can get it with minimal effort...just don't expect to.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jun 30th 2006 at 6:30pm EDT by TheExalted</i></div>
