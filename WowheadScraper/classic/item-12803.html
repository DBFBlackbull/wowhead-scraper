Make sure you kill the Withered Protector (55/56) whenever he walks by. It has a higher drop rate off of him. Not a 10% or anything, but better than the normal elementals</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is just my opinion but like someone said earlier, there are easier ways of making money than by killing endless mobs. What I do is wait until I need exp to level (L60s can stop reading at this point) and then start farming. Even if no essences drop it still won't be a wasted trip because I'll have got the exp I need.<br /><br />Don't farm for no reason, it doesn't work often enough :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well then. If you're a fire mage and not farming here, you need your head examined.<br /><br />Pull with pyro, fireball, fire blast, the usual. As a gnome, the escape artist racial trait keeps you from getting slowed or rooted.<br /><br />I just grinded from 51 to 56 on the tar elementals. (Lurkers and Lords). I farmed about 40 Living Essences, and with selling those, and vendor trash, garnered about 300g+. I went from all green items, to all but 2 blue items. At level 55, I periodically oneshotted them as well. (~2k Pyro crit + 1k DOT) Very fast, and not nearly as crowded as, say, WPL.<br /><br />I can't speak for Felwood being worse or better, but Un'Goro tars are definitely the way to go for fire mages. I will be farming these for gold when I hit 60 for sure. Thanks to tracart in another thread (can't remember which...) for suggesting this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First time i went into Irontree Cavern i got 2 in less than 10 mins. The second time i went i got 3 in 3 hours. I was there yesterday, spent 5 hours and only got 2 essences. They sell pretty good at the AH but i'm starting to think it's not worth the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just killed about 700 of them.... got the 12 I need for hide of the wild.... got like 5 other green items and one blue so I'm happy! and a lot of herbs ofcourse.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ive been heading to Un'goro to farm for the past four or five days. I may have spent six hours total and got over 15 of them dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i went there the other day with a lvl 60 (im lvl 33) and i got a living essence in about 2 mins i love being lucky :) (this was in felwood)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I love dire maul, doesnt matter which side. Its one of my favorites. You can easily fund a small army with the drops. Of course, this depends on if you are stuck on a welfar server like Korialstrasz..lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>killed about 600 of those tar thingies (poor suckers) - did not get a single drop.<br />must have been a hard time for them, maybe they didn't enjoy their lives too much hence producing no single living essence :(<br /><br />trying to do felwood, can only get better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Confirmed as of this posting date.<br /><br />8 hours = 4 essences? Hm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Those who know Dire Maul, LOVE Dire Maul. There are some of the most rare and useful drops in the game in there (pre MC) But, since it is a 5 man instance, it scares the hell out of most Ironforge PUGs. some guildies and I have spent afternoons just clearing it from front to back. Living Essences drop like candy in the Tree/Weed sections. you just have to take the time and clear the rooms.<br /><br />#1 skill in the game: networking, networking, networking. the more hustling you do to get to know some good peeps, the easier the game is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just farm DM west. Easy doable with epic mage-pally combo, mage/druid or mage/shaman.<br />On average like 3-4 per hour drop :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was just at DM East and 5 dropped. They are so easy to find.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Went to Un'goro and got 2 within 10 minutes...<br /><br />now I just need 7 more</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i need for Hide of The Wild and Living Shoulders</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>DM West is the best place to get these if you can get a group. Even a smaller group can farm the mobs that drop these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I guess you just need to grind Dire Maul for this....only problem is finding a group, even when you're lvl 60<br /><br />what is it with ppl not wanting to go into Dire Maul?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i rule</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>they are selling for 1g90s each on AH.. frostman &gt; &lt; god... its cheap!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>anyone know if the drop rates have increased at all since the new nature resist gear?</div>
