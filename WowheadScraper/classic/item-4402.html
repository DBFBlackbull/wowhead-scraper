<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>how much are these worth on AH?, get tons of em when farming for whelplings in badlands, not sure if i should put em up on AH or if its not worth it, is there a demand for these at all? little help plz</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why in the world are those selling for *only* 20 silver?&nbsp; THAT IS SUPER CHEAP.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I never see these on the AH, because they are such rare drops.<br /><br />Tried to farm, no luck.&nbsp; Went to all the above mentioned places; did it several times.&nbsp; Did they nerf it?&nbsp; I attempted to farm these over the course of the last 2 months, every so often.<br /><br />If anyone knows anything about this, please post a reply.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't want to give away my secret spot but it's time for me contribute.<br />If you are level 40-44 this is a great place to grind for exp and cash.<br />I will explain this per 100 kills.&nbsp; The amount of kills per hour depends on you.<br />If too many people are farming the area it sux but hopefully, enough players 40ish <br />will come here to grind which will increase the availablity of small flame sacs and <br />make them more affordable which means more players can afford the Elixir of Fire Protection.<br />I would rate this place ideal for a solo player at level 41-44.&nbsp; I find grinding mobs 2 levels lower than myself if the fastest way.&nbsp; At the same level or above they take too long to kill and the time spent sitting and eating is wasted, not to mention buying food.&nbsp; You may want to try this at lower levels with a partner or at the mid to high thirties in a group.&nbsp; The whelps are casters so they don't pull.&nbsp; The fireball hits pretty hard but you can see them preparing to cast and if you can iterrupt it (like a rogue using kick)then they go down fast.&nbsp; If you have any fire protection armor then it can be resisted or the damage reduced.<br /><br />Level 40-42 Scalding whelps <br />Eastern Badlands - Lethlor Ravine<br />To get there Fly from Ironforge to Thelsamar, head Southeast to the entrance to the Badlands.<br />Go past Uldaman and start working East. There is a small shortcut near Camp Kosh that takes <br />you right to the northern location.<br /><br />There are two areas: north and south of the Dragon Ring.&nbsp; If you can clean out one area then<br />head to the next fine, but at level 40ish you probably want to stick to one location.<br /><br />In one hour I made 100 kills exactly solo and the results were<br /><br />20 small flame sacs (sell for 10 gold)<br />Silver loot &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 gold)average 2 silver per whelp)<br />Vendor trash &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.3 gold)<br />6 wicked claws &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (sold for 3 gold)<br />used for blacksmithing and leatherworking<br />1 Citrine (sold for 50 silver) <br />2 Aquamarine &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (sold for 1 gold) <br /><br />Total cash per hour &nbsp; 18 gold 80 silver<br />Total EXP per hour &nbsp; 30,000 EXP&nbsp; <br />(at level 60 I don't get exp but the whelps average 300 with rest bonus)<br /><br />Added Tip: While you are grinding you can offer to buy them for 25s each in the general chat channel.<br />If someone doesn't enjoy you making a profit then they don't have to sell them to you.&nbsp; Some players vendor them for 2s 50c and don't know that they could make ten times as much selling them to you.&nbsp; The downside is that some players may come right to your spot and start grinding them to sell you the sacs, so use your judgement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dont know about wetlands,m but the droprate in Badlands is the about the same as it says here at Thottbot. I have probebly gotteon like 100 of them while farming for the Dark Whelping(that i got today^^) And i have only been farming here one day, so dont think that the droprate is soooo bad =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if you go to Badlands, and go east, you will find Lethlor ravine.. insde this ravine is elite dragons, but south and north of these elites will you find these little whelps.. i thought i might farm these for alittle XP, and the drops are good, the Forked tongue and the ripped wing webbing is good to grind.. <br />concerning the Dark Whelping, well 1/5000 isnt that good drop rate.. i thought i might try it anyway, need the money.. my advice if u want this dark whelpling is: stay positive, go there alittle everyday and farm.. bring water (if u use mana) and if you are a shaman, put a Earth shock rank 1 on your interface. the whelps use fireballs alot and use earth shock to interrupt those.. it doesnt cost mana but it will stop the dragon from hitting that 200 dmg from fireball.. =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been farming whelps in the wetlands for 8 days now, looking for tiny crimson whelpling drops, and I just found out today that these flame sacs that I've been neglecting to pick up go 2 for 1 gold on the AH.&nbsp; I've probably neglected picking up over 100 of them.&nbsp; In the past hour since I've known they were valuable I've picked up 8, the drop rate seems to be about one in 15-20 whelps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>on my server (spinebreaker), the small flame&nbsp; sacs dont AH that well...&nbsp; &nbsp; try 7s for one (if they sell at all).&nbsp; however, i havent really been following the market for them, so perhaps it's semi-temporary.&nbsp; <br /><br />anyway, my point is, the profit all depends on the market (demand).&nbsp; evidently a lot of people farm them lately on my server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I killed about 15 of these little suckers in Badlands(the Scalding Whelps) and have gotten 5 so far.. So since I'm not.. like uber mathematical I'll just try and do a simpler way.<br /> This is what appears to be my luck:<br /><br /><u>1 Whelp</u><br />1 Ripped Wing Webbing(Vendor cash)<br />0-1 Forked Tongue(Also Vendor cash)<br />0-1 Small Flame Sac<br /><br /><u>5 Whelps</u><br />5 Ripped Wing Webbing<br />2-4 Forked Tongues<br />1-3 Small Flame Sacs<br /><br /><u>10 Whelps</u><br />10&nbsp; Ripped Wings<br />Around 4 Forked Tongues<br />2-4 Small Flame Sacs<br /><br /><u>15 Whelps</u><br />15 RIpped Wings<br />6 Forked Tongues<br />5 Small Flame Sacs<br />1 Aquamarine<br /><br />My Drop Rate % for Small Flame Sac: 33%<br />My Drop Rate % for Ripped Wings: 99%<br />My Drop Rate % for Forked Tongues: 40%<br />My Drop Rate % for Aquamarine: 0.07%<br /><br />Well that's my figuring... Feel free to Correct me if I'm wrong(nobodies perfect ;P )<br /><br /><b>P.S.</b> For druids....<br /> If you're balance, this is a great opportunity. These guys are pretty weak against Arcane and Nature(my crits averaged up to 700 with Starfire and 400-500 with Wrath on them, I'm a lv <b>40</b> druid.)<br /> Also the combo Starfire &gt; HIBERNATE &gt; Starfire &gt;Hibernate (yes, hibernate, the ol' beast soloing technique does work still ;D ) is the best for these Whelps because <u>Scalding Whelps are casters</u></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lvl 41 - In wetlands... able to grind them very very fast but almost no drops.&nbsp; I killed over 200+++ i got 6 flame sacs... I actually got a Tiny Crimson Whelp before i got a flame sac... go figure...<br /><br />Wetlands = Bad grinding spot for flame sac.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I get these from Dreaming Whelps and Adolescent Whelps when grinding Green Whelp Scales (for the Skinning Gloves Enchant) in Swamp of Sorrows at Iscaris's Cave.&nbsp; The drop rate is about 10% for sacs but you hafta skin for the green scales.&nbsp; The respawn rate here is pretty good so you can run the circuit with little downtime. I recently tried out the Dragon Breath Chili in Tanaris on the Dunemaul Ogres.&nbsp; Two doses for 20 minutes worth and it did not proc once, I took a real beating testing it out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have so many stacks of these small flame sacs for sale on Arthas server Alliance side. Send mail to Shackster if you want some and I will send you a COD for 2g a stack.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You guys are overstepping the obvious. I'm on the alextraza server and i have a lvl 42 warrior. i was on a cooking quest to get giant eggs which drop off the roc's in tanaris and i had to get like 30-40 of them off the flaming rocs down there in only about 45min. simple farming...best part is i am pvp warrior and i use the sacs for dragonbreath chili(BG food if u didn't know) so go ahead and farm up.&nbsp; and don't sell them to the vender..u get much more in the AH from ppl like me that use them in cooking and alchamists!<br /><br />Have fun and happy farming!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Horde - you probably want to go for the sprite darters. Otherwise, follow Alliance<br /><br />Alliance - DO NOT FARM WETLANDS! Take some time to lvl, and increase your drop rate by <u>almost</u> 10%! Go to the Badlands and farm the Scadling Whelps. See grinding guide above for specific details.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'll go ahead and toss this loc up since I didn't see anyone else talking about it.<br /><br />To the very south of Dustwallow Marsh (46, 80 area) theres a whole bunch of whelps, all with really good drop rates. I'd go check them out if you're looking for these sacs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I looted 20 of these in about 1 hour and 30 mins in the green belt area of the wetlands running up and down the moutain side so if your having a hard time give it a try. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Slayer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just go to Feralas. I wasn't even trying to get these, I was just questing, and I came on here to check if they were worth something.&nbsp; so I offed 20 of the sprites (12 for 1 quest 8 for other) and I have ten flame sacs.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nochz</b></h3>I cleared the entire area from north to south 35+ of Scalding Whelps (East in Badlands, mentioned in the comments here) and I got 2 of these. <br />Not sure if people are very lucky or if Im unlucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Caelsx</b></h3>Better to grind the whelps in badlands over swamp of sorrows, many more whelps!<br /><br />Also to the southwest of the ravine where you grind them in badlands, you can farm elemental earth is well which sells good too.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wimbleton</b></h3>Not a pleasant place to visit normally but The Quagmire (west of Tabetha's Cottage) has bunches of Searing Hatchlings at around level 41. My drop rate was about 20% and the respawn rate is pretty good. Terrific spot for a skinner as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cybertuna</b></h3>on SoD phase 2:<br /><br />1. These DO NOT drop from the whelps in Swamp of Sorrows. 2 separate sessions, killed 50 in each session, zero drops.<br /><br />2. Droprate for these in Wetlands is horrible.<br /><br />Seems the higher level whelps have a much better chance of dropping these. The 25ish% listed here for Wetlands and SoS is total bs, not accurate at all</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kelmagii</b></h3>These appear to be HEAVILY nerfed in SOD Phase 2 (appears this way) ; The loot is beginning to look like that of the fire mobs in Un'goro that are farmed for the Essence of Fire where about 15 out of the 20 mobs do NOT drop anything. Good luck grinding everyone! Keep Swimming!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ssateneth</b></h3>All of the whelps and sprite dragons have more or less the same drop rate, regardless of the mob's level. Some mobs don't drop anything at all, and wowhead does not present this correctly, which causes some mobs to appear to have much higher drop rate than reality.<br /><br />If you want to farm these, the best spot on Season of Discovery is the whelps in the nightmare portion of Duskwood. I got about 60 of them in an hour as a feral druid. They are dense enough and respawn quickly enough that it's the best spot to farm these bar none.<br /><br />The next best place is eastern Wetlands - the distance between each whelp is on the longer side, but you won't ever need to wait on respawns. All 4 whelp variants there will drop the flame sacs at the same rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PliniusElder</b></h3>I don't get it. I must have killed around 200 Scalding Whelps and I have not gotten a single one.
