<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The idea is this.&nbsp; Collect as much runecloth as possible and as many of Osseous Agitators that you can.&nbsp; Purchase several arcane quickeners and then turn them all in at the same time.&nbsp; Your reputation may only move slightly but when you drop 400 of em in well, that's a nice sway of reputation for all the runecloth that you don't really need (unless you use it for your profession.)&nbsp; I'm an alchemist and all my guildies are on Mooncloth so Runecloth is only good for AH.&nbsp; This is a good place to drop em and get something beneficial out of it.&nbsp; And yes you must complete all 4 caulron quests prior to getting these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>^ you dont need to do <b>all</b> 4 before you can use the Osseous Agitators, you just need to do the cauldron quest at that farm first. <br /> So to do the other cauldrons you need to do the main quest first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Even if your guildmates are &quot;on mooncloth&quot; you need bolts of runecloth for pretty much every item aswell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just finnished these quests and got around 25-30k XP and a sword, as well as a necklass. The sword is like 35.9 dps with +11 Stam or Intellect (pending which u choose) and the necklass is +11 stam and +7 spirit (i think) and i got about +3000 faction off this + 1.5kish SW faction.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Osseous Agitators are used for the Felstone Field cauldron. To actually get them to drop you need to be carrying a &quot;Vitreous Focuser&quot; which you can get from Apothercary Dithers at the Bulwark (for the horde side at least)<br /><br />The Ectoplasmic Resonators and Somatic Intensifiers (for the other three cauldrons) won't drop without the focuser on you either. <br /><br />The reason this is worth doing is that at Revered reputation (or possibly halfway to revered) the only way to get rep is to do cauldrons or to turn in scourgestones. Many would say that its not worth it to get to Revered/Exalted with Argent Dawn... but if you want that high rep this is one of the two ways to get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I completed all the cauldron quests and such from dithers... But now when i talk to he says &quot;Just get the Focuser from me&quot;... and there is no option to buy it or get it.&nbsp; My options include getting mat list for the various caldrons and an option to buy arcane quickener... but no Vitreous Focuser.&nbsp; <br /><br />what am i doing wrong?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have the Vitreuos Focuser in my inventory, I have been killing skeletons, ghouls, and all sort of things for hours, and no agitators dropped? I tried use the vitreu-ous focuser but it didnt work so i assume that as long as you have it in your inventory the agitators with drop from the ghouls you kill? its not dropping for me...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, you'd assume that the cauldron at Gahrron's Withering should provide more reputation than the one at Felstone Field. If you thought so, then you are wrong. With human reputation gain bonus, I got +28 AD repu from both cauldron runs, although the mobs around Gahrron's Withering are tougher (lvl 55-58) than those around Felstone Field.<br /><br />The only bonus that comes from killing mobs around Gahrron's Withering is that you get Invader Scourgestones from high level undead. So if you want to do it quickly, stick to Felstone Field, I say.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im not too sure but, I killed about 15 of those undead at any farm;never got any Osseous Agitators. Once I put on the <br />Argent Dawn Trinket, I started getting some.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>THIS IS THE USE:<br />COMPLEAT 1ST CAULDREN LORD QUEST<br />FARM SOME OF THEASE X6<br />THEN GET 1 <br />THN 4 <br /><br />GO 2 THE CAULDREN IN FELLSTONE FIELD AND RUGHT CLCK ON THE CAULDRN.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You need to have Vitreous Focuser in your bag, you get it in Wpl.<br />Then they will drop.<br />It is used by the felstone cauldrond.<br />You can get a Vitreous Focuser after you have done the quest about all the cauldrons.<br />You can make a quest with them, you need:<br />Arcane Quickener: 0/1 <br />Osseous Agitator: 0/6 <br />Runecloth: 0/4 <br /><br />You can buy Arcane Quickener from vendor in wpl for 50silver</div>
