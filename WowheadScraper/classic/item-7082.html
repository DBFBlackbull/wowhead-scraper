Be prepared, though, everyone and their brother farms these things there, it is sometimes hard to get them. Visit at off-peak hours for your best chance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Asher</b></h3>If this doesn't work for you, you might try buying Essence of Water and getting them transmuted. That's probably the easiest way since EoW are always on the AH for a reasonable price.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>396</b></h3>A warlock specced with Intensity and a Paladin can duo these and clear the whole place before respawns. Have the Paladin use Concentration Aura, tag 4-7 elementals (as much as you can grab running around without losing them) with Curse of Elements, and once they're on you, use Hellfire and have the Paladin heal you. You can easily get 5-12 essence per hours.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Binary</b></h3>I've spent several hours farming these off the Dust Stormers in Silithus. The drop rate varied, but I was able to get about 4-8 essence per hour as a shadow spec'd priest. Depending on your server, you may have to compete with others for the mobs - I however never had a problem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8722</b></h3>I don't know how readable this will be but here's a little diagram of the transmute circle that is possible with elemental essences. The main circle is Earth to Water to Air to Fire and back to Earth. The two branches are Life to Earth to Life and Water to Undeath to Water.<br /><br />Life ‹-› Earth ‹-› Water ‹-› Undeath<br />...............^............v<br />.............Fire.. ‹-› ..Air</div>

Quest series starts with &quot;Doctor Theolen Krastinov, the Butcher&quot; from a ghost NPC right outside the door to Scholomance.&nbsp; There are two ghosts and they are kind of hard to see, you can easily run by them without noticing.&nbsp; Speak to the lady and she will tell you a story first, then you will be able to get the quest.&nbsp; There are two other quests in the series that require you to return to Scholomance and kill other bosses.&nbsp; Upon completion of the line you will get a trinket that allows you to see the rest of the ghosts of Caer Darrow.<br /><br />2. Equip the trinket and go to where the blacksmithing building is in Caer Darrow (it is inside the walls, not by the docks).&nbsp; There is a dwarf there who sells the transmute formula.&nbsp; He also sells the recipe for Major Mana Potion and some blacksmithing plans.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It never ceases to amaze me how many people become belligerent over drop rates for the uncommon materials and patterns needed to make rare and epic gear.&nbsp; If these things were easy to make, they wouldn't be rare or epic.&nbsp; If the materials were easy to gather, everyone would have the end product.&nbsp; There would be no challenge, everyone would have amazing gear, and there would be no reason to work for anything.&nbsp; I'm glad there are stupid-hard tasks to complete in this game.&nbsp; I'm happy that it's actually noteworthy for such-and-such guild to have what's-the-name that is capable of crafting X item or performing Y enchant from patterns and formulae that take a lot of effort or luck just to gain, material gathering aside.<br /><br />I guess that part of the problem is Thottbot.&nbsp; When you can easily look up how to get something, you expect to be able to do so.&nbsp; It's like the people who beg for money so they can train in everything that's available at their new level: they feel that they're entitled to it just because it's there, that the difficulty involved is somehow not intentional or something that needs to be &quot;fixed.&quot;<br /><br />IMHO, it should take the efforts of many to craft one Shifting Cloak.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Theres a very simple concept you need to understand about why it may or may not drop.&nbsp; Contrary to grammer school logic, 5% chance doesn't mean that you will see 5 drops out of 100 kills.&nbsp; Infact, you could kill somthing a million times and never see it once.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I flip a coin 100 times and every single time it comes up heads...what are the odds is going to be tails on the next flip?<br /><br />People have this weird idea that if its a 10% chance that one out of ten times it will happen.&nbsp; Thats not true...statistics are alot more complicated then that.&nbsp; It could drop 1000 times in a row, and then not drop over the next 9000 times....that makes it 1000/10000 and a 10% chance of dropping...but not 1 out of every 10 drops was that item.&nbsp; In fact if you look at a span of the first 2000 drops, it was a 50% chance, but over a span of 10000 drops, it was a 10% chance.&nbsp; Does that make sense?<br /><br />My point is this, while it might be a 5% chance of dropping you could see one drop every other guy or not at all.&nbsp; Its the same reason why some people get every single roll in a run, while others don't get any.&nbsp; Its just random, and random means exactly what its supposed to mean: Having no specific pattern, purpose, or objective.<br /><br />The % of drop that is represented here is supposed to represent the chance of it dropping over an infinite number of drops.&nbsp; Over a span of so many kills, that % could be completely different based on the random factor.<br /><br />Statistics are not an easy subject.&nbsp; Thats why im a junior in college taking a class on them.&nbsp; Not a freshman in highschool...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Using my 60 shaman, here's how I farm Dust Stormers for essences:<br /><br />1) Grab as much nature resistance as you can before you leave.&nbsp; Also grab at least 2-3 stacks of food and water.<br />2) Upon reaching NW silithus, buff rockbiter or windfury.&nbsp; I personally prefer the consistency of rockbiter.&nbsp; Around 300dmg a hit with TUF.<br />3) Stand in between 2 dust stormers that are no more than 50 yards apart.&nbsp; Ideally, try to find 3.<br />4) Start off with flame shock.&nbsp; As the mob comes towards you, put down stoneskin, nature resist and mana spring totems.&nbsp; Replace mana spring totem with water spirit trinket if its up.<br />5) Do NOT put down fire totems as the lightning shield will kill them off making them mana inefficient.<br />6) Reapply flame shock once it runs out. Use frost shock when u get clearcasting or if you have elemental mastery.<br />7) Once you kill the dust stormer, heal up and pull the second dust stormer into your totems.<br />8) Repeat if you have a third one in range.&nbsp; My 2 min totems usually run out after the third one.<br /><br />Using this method, I can farm about 5 pairs of dust stormers before having to eat/drink.&nbsp; It's not super fast but you'll be able to kill about 300 dust stormers in 4 hours.&nbsp; On average, it will yield about 5-6 essences.&nbsp; If you're lucky, you'll be able to find the whirling invaders and farm those.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh... one additional tip... get a good guild that talks a lot of crap on their chat.&nbsp; It's gonna be long and boring.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as a fire mage I can kill them very fast <br />mage armor &amp; dampen magic and you only take ~50 damage from them...no need for frost nova kiting..go all out dps<br />sometimes they died imediately after the pyro - fireball - fireblast opener &amp; DOTs&nbsp; if I critted.<br />Didn't even have much downtime, drinking only 2-3 times between the evocation cooldown<br />In 3 hours I had 90 core of elements, 11 essence of air, 3 greens etc.<br /><br />On my rogue they were totally annoying, had to heal after each &gt;.&gt;<br /><br />for melees they are bad because they deal nature damage that isn't reduced by armor and can't be dodged, parried or blocked</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you need to be a masochist to farm those.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>killed about 150, still no drop.<br /><br />When I think i need 8 for my stormshould set... :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>luckily I'm a tauren hunter, so with AotW I get +60 nature resist, 10 nature resist racial ability and with a druid (with improved MotW) that's 107 nature resists without requiring special gear. That makes it easy to farm these as most of their magical attacks are nature based.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Think i have farmed for about 6-7 hours and i've gotten 4 essences so far. It sure takes time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate seems low, but last night for about 4 or 5 hours, I think my roomie and I who were farming them got extremely lucky. Ended up finding maybe around 10 elemental air, 16 breath of wind, and 6 essence of air all combined when we were done. We were farming the air for future enchants for ourselves. :)<br /><br />We also found additional items on the guys. So, worked out well, but like I said, think we got really lucky. In last hour the drops dropped to a crawl, then nothing. But was fun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It seems that the drop rate may have been nerfed slightly this latest patch (the one in April). I've been here for 3 hours now and have gotten a grand total of 2 elemental airs and 2 breaths of wind - and no essence of air.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>killed 90, no Essence of air :D but i am realy unlucky ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got one on first try from a cyclone warrior, then i went to those dust stormers with the 1,89% dropchance, 2 hours later i still had nothing from those, DONT GO DUST STORMERS ! THEY SUCK!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I haven't noticed any changed, increased dropchance, atleast not for the Dust Stormers.<br />Just killed 100 of those, lootet 1 single Essence. &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Porknog</b></h3>Farmed ten of these for my Robe of the Archmage. The first three came at regular intervals of 1 per 50 kills. After that they got kind of streaky, in total I ended up killing 236 Dust Stormers for 10 Essences.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Winder88</b></h3>For people farming that since Classic launch : <br /><br />Which mobs to farm = <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11744/dust-stormer">Dust Stormer</a> in Silithus<br />Location = All around the back of The Crystal Vale &quot;moutain&quot;.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hatesauce</b></h3>Wow Classic can confirm 29% drop rate is a lie. I have killed like 50 and not one has dropped. Not sure where these results come from but they are wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Patr</b></h3>202 kills:<br />6 essence<br />13 Breath of Wind<br />12 Elemental Air<br />Pattern Frostweave Robe, green ring , green 1h sword and Thorium Lockbox. <br /><br />Classic time wasting. Better farm more valuable mobs that dropping gold/cloth(felcloth) and buy Essence.<br />P.s. 1st Essence dropped from 91 kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vyamont</b></h3>Yeah don't know where this drop rate is coming from , 60 Kills zero essence. Can we get a reset or something these numbers seem pretty off.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>addohm</b></h3>For reference (in classic) it took me about 3-4 hours to farm 8 essence, while Windreaver was up. I also got 8 BoE Greens with a level range of 52 to 55.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>joss002</b></h3>I wouldnt bother farming these, just farm gold in Silithus. If a mob comes along that drops these then yeah go for it but its so much quicker just farming gold.<br /><br />These are selling for 12 gold each on my server.<br /><br />A stack of 20 <a href="/classic/item=20424/sandworm-meat">Sandworm Meat</a> is selling for 24 gold and takes no time to farm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vyrnius</b></h3>I got 10 <a href="/classic/item=7082/essence-of-air">Essence of Air</a> after killing 167 <a href="/classic/npc=11744/dust-stormer">Dust Stormer</a>.
