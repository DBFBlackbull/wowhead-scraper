If it says 60%, this means out of 100, 60 is how much is average for you to have. \n\nThis can mean that out of 100, either 60 mobs have dropped 1, or 1 mob has dropped 60 mageweave. The thottbot values for most mobs are roughly accurate (especially those with a high kill value). (This is also why some mobs have a number higher than 100% chance to drop something, it's because they drop more than 1 per mob on average). \n\nIf you look at the drop rates, there is one mob that stands out. The level 50-51 elites in Jintha alor, have a 95%+ drop rate of mageweave.\n\nAs a 60 hunter with an epic mount and beast handling, I managed to get to the very top of jintha alor in about a minute and a bit, taking a total of about 800 damage from aggro.

I stumbled upon them last night looking for a quest, they drop alot, and respawn fast. Some drop 3-4 most drop atleast 2, and it doesn't require a level 60 or 70..In 10-15 minutes my 46 Shammy farmed 2 stacks.. no joke. Very rarely do they just drop money, but even if a few don't drop any, you make it up on the ones that drop 3 and 4 at a time.</div>

L41-45 abouts.<br /><br />Drops here are very good. And Thottbot seems to reflect that (Sort the list by Kills primarily, and Drop% secondary)<br /><br />Got 3 stacks (60 total) in an hour at L55.... since they drop quick and there are hundreds of them to kill</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The drop rate for mageweave is ~ 60% on all deadwood furbolgs in felwood. That is high, if not the highest.<br /><br />But as a bonus you get to raise faction with the timbermaws by killing them. Two birds with one stone.<br /><br />Even better deadwoods cluster in groups of 3-5 so if your a mage there is AoE fun to be had.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The dunemaul outpost of ogres in Tanaris is a good spot.&nbsp; Ogres as a farmers wet dream since they have low hp, don't run and don't have any debuffs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Two stacks in an hour with a 60 hunter in agi/crit gear.<br /><br />The problem with other mobs is that they run, not because they can hurt you at 60, but it's annoying to have to go after them to loot them. Ogres come to you to deliver their mageweave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I took one of the above posters suggestions and tried the Deadwood Furlbogs in southern Felwood as a source for Mageweave drops. The good news was that they were level 48 (I'm level 56) and so I was able to get SOME experience while I farmed mageweave. The bad news is that the drops are NOWHERE near what the Thottbot stats say they are. I'd put the drop rate closer to 30% than 60%.<br /><br />The best drop rates I've found are still with the Witherbark Trolls in NE Hinterlands. The drawback here is that they are level 46 and 47 and if, like me, you're level 56 or above, you're not going to get any exp. Still, the drop rate does actually seem to be around 60%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First, thottbot's % is also based on the *number* of mageweave they drop. If it says 60%, this means out of 100, 60 is how much is average for you to have. <br /><br />This can mean that out of 100, either 60 mobs have dropped 1, or 1 mob has dropped 60 mageweave. The thottbot values for most mobs are roughly accurate (especially those with a high kill value). (This is also why some mobs have a number higher than 100% chance to drop something, it's because they drop more than 1 per mob on average). <br /><br />If you look at the drop rates, there is one mob that stands out. The level 50-51 elites in Jintha alor, have a 95%+ drop rate of mageweave.<br /><br />As a 60 hunter with an epic mount and beast handling, I managed to get to the very top of jintha alor in about a minute and a bit, taking a total of about 800 damage from aggro. Once there, go in the cave and start killing. <br /><br />You kill em slower than lower level non elites, so if you are *just* after mageweave there might be better spots, but in an hour, I've managed to get 3 stacks of mageweave, 7 greens, 4 greys worth over a gold each, 6 gold from dropped silver.<br /><br />Overall I think this makes them my favourite source, as I can get alot of other stuff at the same time. (BTW, the wolves are also a pretty good source of tender wolf meat, which can be turned into the +15 stamina steaks, and vile priestess Hexx has a high respawn rate and also drops alot of mageweave).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to Jintha'Alor to try farming.&nbsp; After 1 hour, I had 69 Mageweave Cloth.&nbsp; Each mob does not drop it everytime, but when they do drop it, it is usually 3-4 of them at a time.<br /><br />They dropped off of:<br />Vilebranch Soothsayer<br />Vilebranch Berserker<br />Vilebranch Headhunter<br />Vilebranch Shadow Hunter<br /><br />According to my stats, it shows a 100% droprate off of these ... which isn't true, just that the amount dropped was equal to the ammount of mobs killed, not that they all dropped it every time.<br /><br />I hope that this is helpful</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Grinded a bit arround tanaris, tried the pirates and the ogres in the different ruins. But nothing beats the droprates at Dunemaul compound. They drop about 3-4 at the time, but they dont drop much else(prevents yoru bags from getting filled with junk though). Mobs are scattered arround in groups of 2-4, but some can be gathered to aoe. Grinded there as lvl 70 mage and got over 8 stacks less than an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Around (43,52). <br /><br />With a lvl 61 numter (tanking, lol) and my lvl 49 lock, we collected ~16 stacks between in ~3 hours. We also tried Feralas, but found the Tenaris drop rate was much better (and the killing was more fun, lol).<br /><br />For those without coordinates:<br />Good luck if you nomrally rely upon written descriptions of landmarks, because Tenaris <br />doesn't have any I could write about here, lol. It might be better to think about this:<br />* The coordinate system notation is<br />(&quot;horizontal distance&quot;, &quot;vertical distance&quot;). <br />* (50,50) is the middle of any map. <br />* (0,0) is the upper left corner of any map.<br />Thus the Compound is almost smack dab in the middle of the Tenaris map, slightly (7/100th of the map's width) to the west.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found a great place to farm this in The Hinterlands. Just west of that shore with all the turtles on it there are two troll camps right next to each other. The trolls in each camp have some of the highest drop rate in The Hinterlands. In the time that it takes for a lvl 49 Warlock (me) to clear out one base the other has completely respawned so that you can continue farming without stopping. I hope this helped</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The best location i've found for farming Mageweave is the northspring harpys (and variations of) in north-western feralas (40,12) - ruins of ravenwind. They are from level 48-51 or so and drop 1-3 mageweave about 80% of the time or better. <br /><br />I first started killing them for a quest when my hunter was still in the mid 40s. One at a time they were no problem. The best part is, if you are farming mageweave for another toon, they'll level you all the way to 60. Granted not very quickly but a little EXP is better than no EXP.<br /><br />For a 59 hunter they drop like flies and the stacks of cloth accumulate very quickly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Looks like the gravy train for Mageweave Cloth is over.... at least it is from the Northspring Harpes. I've killed over 200 of them today and only got 2 stacks of Mageweave Cloth. One in six kills dropped Mageweave and only one or two cloth dropped for the kill. These harpes suck for Mageweave.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 16th 2006 at 12:47pm PST by XenaSkull</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The highborne camp in Azshare has pretty good drops on mageweave. There are 2 types of mobs here, Highborne Apparitions and Highborne Lichlings. I'm lvl 64 grinding cloth for tailoring and getting a decent drop rate here. The only problem is the small amount of them, and the somewhat long respawn timer. I'll be trying other spots listed here, but heres a screenshot from an hour of farming<br /><br />I farmed at a slow pace, bored with the slow respawn time. This was a little under an hour, but I could have moved faster, when I cleared the camp sometimes I would alt tab and browse this site for a few minutes. I just got mobinfo2 recently so this is my only info on mageweave cloth, of course the sample size is pretty small, but this should help a bit.<br /><br /><a href="http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/6828/mage3ww6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/6828/mage3ww6.jpg</a></div>

    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
