I have a lvl60 of each and the pally does not have the AC nor the HP nor any decent tools like growl to tank and their 1H damage is a complete laugh with the SOTC nerf.

While i myself would pass to a warrior since it's rarity, (Only the MT, however) i would not say it is only good for warriors. Arguably, the most use comes from druids. Because they get 360% armor, its a fairly large bonus. And alliance druids can only get the Turtoise and Protection rings, in which this is a great upgrade of tortoise.

Also, we really don't have many escape spells at all, so one of our best defenses against melee is simply being able to absorb the damage. We have Death Coil (instant cast, dmg and heal 400ish plus 3 sec unbreakable fear) on a 2 min cooldown, which is our best escape spell, especially against rogues. But if death coil is on CD, our next best bet usually is fear, a 1.5 second cast.

A druid can tank decently in mc (we have one tank a dog in the dog packs before mag when we're short warriors), but for the most part you do not want a druid tanking or you're gonna be in trouble.  And if things go bad and a druid goes bear form to try to tank, 95% of the time he's dead before people realize he's trying to tank it.   With that being said, after the warriors get them, its pretty much a ffa after that, because no one class can put the ring to use head and shoulders above anyone else after a Warrior.\n\nIt's sorta like the druids wanting Core Leather Gloves, or Shaman wanting Talisman.

I have no problem with warriors bidding on this ring.  I have no problem with it going to the MT first.  However, why in the world would a warrior automatically receive this ring just because he's a warrior? I don't know a single fury\/arms warrior, rogue, hunter, or shaman who'd want more armor or defense rather than better stats for offensive purposes.  THAT is a waste in my opinion.   As for the warlock argument, there are rings that are MUCH easier to obtain that give you almost the same amount of stamina (because let's face it, you don't need the armor or defense either). The only people who could possibly use this ring is a prot spec'd warrior or a feral druid who uses bear form the majority of the time. Just because most classes are classified into tank\/healer\/dps, there IS such a thing as hybrid. 1.8 will show everyone.\n\nIt's 506 armor (for the druids who have stated that it's less than this, either learn math all over again, or find out more about your class because you...embarass us) for druids and it is true that the defense is only 1\/3 as effective as it is for warriors. Any other statement other than the previous statement is just a plain uninformed and biased opinion, or wrong.\n\nAll the warriors who attempt to justify why druids wouldn't want this or shouldn't get it, EVER, try out a few more classes before you think you know it all. Unlike you, our \"primary\" stat is not pre-determined until we choose the path we want to lead. I know it's hard to imagine being a class that actually has to decide for themselves what stat they want to focus on dependent on talents, but try to grasp that concept.\n\nAnd before warriors flame me, I would never roll on this ring because I don't plan on tanking, or want to, nor do I plan to play primarily in bear form. Feral cat druids don't want this either.\n\nEdited, Mon Oct  3 03:02:23 2005","date":"2005-10-03T06:43:28-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"devanoh","importedSubject":"idiotic warriors?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":51,"id":3071198,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"This is clearly a tanking ring and should go to classes that can tank.

Armor and Defense help but will still be cut down pretty fast in the scrap. Seems like a waste.\n\nhunters - rarely in melee, fights mainly with a bow or gun, but has melee as the fall back and they do not have the dodge and escape abilities of the rouge perhaps it is needed as much as rouge.\n\nDruids - for the love of god you don't even know how to work a sword what the hell are you thinking trying to tank?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>FYI, a druid with good gear can have 13k AC especially with a ring like this. How many warriors do you know with 13k AC? And there are zero pallies with that much AC.<br /><br />The ring is clearly a warriors ring first as they will get 100% benefit from it, but should no warrior roll I would expect druids to take it before pallies.<br /><br />Despite what Blizzard claims, pallies are crap tanks compared to druids. I have a lvl60 of each and the pally does not have the AC nor the HP nor any decent tools like growl to tank and their 1H damage is a complete laugh with the SOTC nerf. You should never let a pally tank so why would they need this ring.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Protection spec warriors would use this ring 24/7 of game play.&nbsp; Mortal strike warriors would use this when they respec or have to fill in while the main tank is being battle rezzed, Druids would use this in PvP in bear form n u cant change gear in combat so they would have to know they were going to be the tank which doesnt happen often.. I can see MS warriors &amp; Druids rolling on this in the future after the Main Tanks have already gotten it. Just as Protection spec warriors shouldnt be rolling on the epic 2hand swords or crit gear until all MS warriors n Palys have got there Phat loots. Its only fair.&nbsp; 4 the good of the guild or get out...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The title says it. While i myself would pass to a warrior since it's rarity, (Only the MT, however) i would not say it is only good for warriors. Arguably, the most use comes from druids. Because they get 360% armor, its a fairly large bonus. And alliance druids can only get the Turtoise and Protection rings, in which this is a great upgrade of tortoise. Paladins...i can't understand your want for this item. In all 3 of my level 60 characters i never have seen a paladin be chosen as a tank over a druid. I'm not saying they don't get use out of it, but i still think a druid should have it. (After the MT)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Loss of Parry + Block is something.<br /><br />More then made up for by the fact that the Bear tank will have more mitigation through armor (alot more) and alos more HP (alot more).<br /><br />Why? Because the bear tank can wear just as much + def + sta gear AND it gets a HP bonus on top (about 1200 extra).<br /><br />Also the paladin lacks agro grabbing abilities like a Druid, where the AoE forced taunt?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>pallies do not have the same mitigation as warriors.&nbsp; without even going into talents, defensive stance alone outclasses a pally.&nbsp; <br /><br />only the extremely well tank equipped paladins are out-mitigating a druid, and then only by a few percent- and the more damage that is being dealt per hit,&nbsp; the less that gap is,&nbsp; when you do the math of multiple mitigation checks vs. a higher primary armor check.<br /><br />and for this (maybe 5%?) difference,&nbsp; you sacrifice stability.&nbsp; no instant aggro grab means if someone pulls aggro off you, they will, in the majority of cases, die before&nbsp; you can re-acquire it.&nbsp; as a healer, i would rather have to drop one more heal on a druid tank than accept automatic death if i accidentally crit a heal at the start of a fight,&nbsp; or if the paladin misses his first 2 swings,&nbsp; since the majority of pally aggro gen is based on hitting with seal of fury up.<br /><br />now i'm not as ignorant as the last poster there,&nbsp; so i don't say this makes paladins strictly worse tanks,&nbsp; just different.&nbsp; your tank warriors should get this first.&nbsp; paladins and druids with tank gear should get second shot at it.<br /><br />and as for the last line there... &quot;no chance&quot;... also already been disproven, by myself and many other druids.&nbsp; whoops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im a druid and i got this &lt;3 this is the perfect all around ring for a druid imo.<br />Never gonna replace it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I wouldn't dream of arguing that yes, prot warriors get first call. I don't even argue with non-prot warriors getting 2nd call, because when another tank is needed, you call on the arms/fury warriors. However, if a <i>paladin</i> rolled against me for this (yes, my guild's DKP system includes a rolling element to keep a bit of chance in there. Because chance is fun), I think I might just feed them their teeth.<br /><br />Cos, see, I'm a druid, with 6k health, 11k armor, and 330 defence (and yes, that's <i>after</i> the defence nerf). -<br /><br /><ul><li>I have tanked an add on Garr<br /></li><li>I have off-tanked Major Domo<br /></li><li>I have tanked free adds on Major Domo when a tank died<br /></li><li>I have saved a Sulfron fight by taking over when the MT died to cover until one of the adds was killed and a warrior was free to come take him off me<br /></li><li>I have been sole tank in more 5-man groups than I like to count<br /></li></ul><br />In my guild raids, if there are more things need tanking than we have warriors (we only take 4 or 5), no one ever asks a paladin to do it. It's always me. Hence, the feeding of teeth. And you know what? After patch 1.9, when I have 15% added threat on all attacks, and 20% more stamina, I'm not just gonna be a better tank than paladins, I'm going to blast them out of the water. My only issue as a bear is that getting hold of +def gear is hard, which I think makes me <i>more</i> entitled to this ring, rather than less. I don't want this ring for PvP, I want to do my job in MC better when I need t tank. A druid will never be as good a tank as a warrior (we're not meant to be as good at any role as the specialist, and druids who want to be need shooting. You're a hybrid class, shut up!), but we're a peerless second.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>very strange indeed - the two posts before me are actually halfway sensible. for one thing, the druid was NOT, unlike most trolls, claiming to be a brilliant MT whos done Rag, Ony, Nef, and evrything inbetween, but instead stated that he/she (yes, i do know RL girls, again unlike most trolls) can tank effectively when required, and has given good reasons why this is betr for a druid than a paladin - although i do actually think its betr for droo than warrior, personally. as for the warlock, well, id nevr really looked at this and thought of u guys, but now that i hav, it makes sense. massive stamina, with a bit of +def and armor for solo tanking.<br /><br />neway, lets be like these guys - make ur point, and stop whinging and trolling. we only need to hear that it belongs to any given class once, then we get our own opinions. so stfu<br /><br />BTW: i hav a 60 Prot-spec warrior, and this is, IMO, druid gear. +360% armor on this baby is massive, and there isnt exactly much +def leather kicking around</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, I see you understand what I meant now.<br /><br />I had a feeling you didn't understand warlocks all too well, which there's nothing wrong with by any means.<br /><br />Most warlocks value stamina ALOT more than intellect, basically because of the nice ability we get at 8 or so, called lifetap :P<br /><br />So hand in hand with that is the fact that we have a tier1 talent which gives us +15% sta and -5% spi (any warlock who even KNOWS what spirit is, is a bad warlock :P). On top of that we get imp lifetap as a tier2 affliction tallent, giving us 504 mana at the cose of 420 life. Good deal.<br /><br />So that should help clear up why warlocks like stamina so much. Also, we really don't have many escape spells at all, so one of our best defenses against melee is simply being able to absorb the damage. We have Death Coil (instant cast, dmg and heal 400ish plus 3 sec unbreakable fear) on a 2 min cooldown, which is our best escape spell, especially against rogues. But if death coil is on CD, our next best bet usually is fear, a 1.5 second cast. When a rogue is hitting you, that can easily turn into 2-3 sec, or I've even seen 6 seconds to cast fear with 2 rogues hitting me. <br /><br />Basically, most warlocks pride themselves on having the most hp of any cloth wearing class, and even other classes. I'm decently geared (a few felheart, ZG stuff, etc.) and have hit 6k hp with raid buffs. I love doing PuG UBRS raids sometimes and having more hp than the MT.<br /><br />I once stood next to one of the bat riders in ZG until he died and survived it, just to prove I could :D The only other cloth class in the raid who could do the same was another warlock, and she's a bigger stam @#$%^ than me.<br /><br />And very good choice with Seal of the Archmagus. I would love to wear that with heavy Dark Iron, until I can get my hands on Band of Dark Dominion and other BWL goodies.<br /><br />P.S. I meant the &quot;30 hp&quot; as in the extra 3 stam I would be getting from the orginial 20 on the ring with Demonic Embrace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why would a druid be tanking in Tier 2. Tier 2 is a resto set, not a feral set.&nbsp; If a druid were to tank, he would be in a feral set.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>basically anyone who wants to spend his/her DKP on. <br /><br />I admit that Paladins have a problem with aggro management, I've played one myself. <br /><br />However, how many of the self-chosen &quot;DPS-warriors&quot; are simply unable to off tank an add from any MC boss, because they don't wear (or don't even have)a shield? <br /><br />Yeah, MT should get priority if he doesn't have this ring already. <br /><br />But before passing this (or any other +armor/sta/defense) item to a warrior, I would make SURE that he knows how to tank. If a warrior rolls for it who cannot tank even 5 man instances without letting the healers die, then a priest should rather roll for that ring, imo. :P<br /><br />It is however, sad, that a lot of times the support classes (druid/pala/shaman) have to show warriors how to tank. :( <br /><br />In our guild, we have a real good tank druid with over 12k armor, and he tanks like an ace. If a lot of warriors would only tank HALF AS GOOD, there would be no deaths anymore in any non-raid instance. ^_^<br /><br />Sure, there are people in every class who don't want to tank/off tank (or can't because of their gear), for example those druids/shamans/palas who set their heart on healing (which they do VERY well though), but I'm sure even full holy/resto shamans (who wear a shield and +defense/armor/sta items), palas and druids could very well out-tank warriors who have never seen a ...shield. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd say anyone is eligible for this ring that can and will fight at a melee range(Hell I'd even let a hunter go for it before casters). After that then let the casters fight for it if it is what they desire. But Tanks should get this first and foremost and there should be no argument about that. They do keep you alive after all: ).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, I agree that this ring can be used by druids and wl's. But, as has been already said, this ring is much much much more effective on a warrior then any other class.<br /><br />External ac bonouses DO NOT get effected by the druids ac increase in bear form, bears can-not block or parry, making the +8 def skill extreemly poor for them compared to a warrior.<br /><br />A wl dont need no def skill and ac aint exactly a priority so they need this for the sta stat only, and druids need for the sta and ac with they dont even get a bonous on. <br /><br />Warriors will use every stat effectivley and all the time, and as such they should have priority on this item. The 9 other druids in our MC raids have agreed to this without a word because they all know its a warrior tanking item, and it has been said that should a warrior not want it druids are then to roll.<br /><br />A wl rolling on this with a warrior is like a warrior rolling on a ring with 15 int but 20 sta becuase 'they use the sta', its just not on, and it doesnt take a genious to realise what class this item was intended priority for.<br /><br />Any wl or druid that rolls on this over the MC regular MT *that takes about 4 million damage for them in a run* is damn greedy and not thinking of the good of the raid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>... First the two or three Maintanks, then the druid bears. 506 (517 with Thick Hide) armor is just unbeatable and there aren't many (leather) items which come with lots of stamina and a lot of armor at the same time (argue with the rouges at this point). A druid can reach 15k (unbuffed) and is quite close to the 75% cap with that (73% if I remember correctly). Playing a druid tank is a matter of style and no &quot;reroll your character&quot; or similar *!@#. So let us get this ring after the mts and shut up. Feral bears are not pvp and they are just useful. First battle tanking an add, second battle healing your party. It's all about being a more flexible raid.<br />Yet I wouldn't give this to a druid who hasn't skilled thick hide - be a bear by heart or forget it. A druid who is feral because he loves to own rogues on a battleground doesn't deserve this ring. There are two kind of feral druids at least (cats e.g. always have omen o.c., bears often don't), so stop judging like they all were the same.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A warrior has 2 main traits to their Class. Stamina and Defense/armor.<br /><br />An EPIC ring, that adds to all three, is clearly an item that a Warrior will benefit most from.<br /><br />Yes, a druid could use it also, but a druid isnt defined by how much stam/ac they have (yes i know they have bear form, but if your tanking ni MC in bear form, there something wrong).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On my server in another guild, where they use a DKP bidding system 2 druids got his not just over a warrior but over the MT. I was pretty shocked to hear that. I'm not saying a druid shouldn't be allowed one, I am saying an MT should get first priority over this ring vs other classes in the raid and also any other warrior who's tanking in MC. You can argue points like the one about polymorphed tanks in BWL, firstly it can be dispelled and secondly getting items like this helps you clear MC more quickly and efficently in the first place. Be almost as bad as a shaman going after a drillboar disk or a priest going after Dominance when he knows he'll vendor it when he gets benediction. People should really take a look at all sides and the greater picture, and yes again I agree it's great PvP, but then if a warrior spent all DKP on what's great PvP in MC and not what's great for tanking too, would you ever have to compete on this ring?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok I lead our guild raid into MC. Here is my thought on it. Warriors will always have first priority on this. It is an excellent ring, and a warrior will more or less equip this ring and never take it off. A druid cannot say that. A druid can tank decently in mc (we have one tank a dog in the dog packs before mag when we're short warriors), but for the most part you do not want a druid tanking or you're gonna be in trouble. And if things go bad and a druid goes bear form to try to tank, 95% of the time he's dead before people realize he's trying to tank it. With that being said, after the warriors get them, its pretty much a ffa after that, because no one class can put the ring to use head and shoulders above anyone else after a Warrior.<br /><br />It's sorta like the druids wanting Core Leather Gloves, or Shaman wanting Talisman. Yes you can use it.....but others will use it better, and mc is about progressing as a raid. So let the items go to whichever class can put them to best use in MC.<br /><br />And as for a Warlock wanting this....if you want to waste your dkp go for it I guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a 0/30/21 Tank-Resto druid and serve my guild well by healing with 8K mana and tanking with 10K+ armor when we don't have enough warriors in MC.

It'll happen eventually, so all of you warriors can bite me =P<br /><br />How'd I get my loot?

It's been mentioned twice, and I'm getting the impression that neither of those 2 people have even played a druid or so much as look at a druid profile on this very site. This ring's armor will most certainly be multiplied by 4.6 in dire bear form, just like Ring of Protection, Thrall's Resolve, etc.<br /><br />I'd of course let the warriors roll and get this ring first, but there's no way I'm letting a shaman (I'm a tauren druid) get this thing over me. There is life outside of MC...it's like some of you people think there's no stepping back OUT of the instance portal to do other things.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Would everyone please stop flaming each other about who the ring is best for and what one class can use best. It's a nice ring, it's perfect for tanking, it's nice for druids and paladins, it's also nice for warlocks obsessed with high hps rather than mana since they can lifetap. We use a druid sometimes to Offtank Domo's adds in MC, yes it can be done, sometimes we have to use paladins to offtank one of Garr's adds. But the point is when one of these drops everyone in our guild automatically knows that the tanks have first dibs, since it benefits us the most.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm sorry, but if a druid (or any other class besides warrior) goes on 10 runs, and sees the ring go to a warrior each time, and then the next time, when some warrior who just leveld to 60 joins and it drops....it shouldn't go to the warrior just becasue he's a warrior.<br /><br />Decisions usually aren't that easy, and if you make them that easy, then you're just not being fair to your fellow players.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sure druids and warlocks want to roll on this item. So would I (hunter). Thats not the point. I am pretty sure druids and warlocks (and hunters) want their tier 2 armor sets and eventually tier 3 from BWL. Best way to get it? Aside from the obvious skills and tactics.. GEAR! If your guild is equipping locks and druids with this for pvp purposes than sorry, you aint gonna get your tier 3 armor.. <br /><br />Of course when the melee (war, pally, rogue) got theirs then you can roll, but in PVE you are not taking melee damage or you are doing something very very wrong...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think so. I have no problem with warriors bidding on this ring. I have no problem with it going to the MT first. However, why in the world would a warrior automatically receive this ring just because he's a warrior? I don't know a single fury/arms warrior, rogue, hunter, or shaman who'd want more armor or defense rather than better stats for offensive purposes. THAT is a waste in my opinion. As for the warlock argument, there are rings that are MUCH easier to obtain that give you almost the same amount of stamina (because let's face it, you don't need the armor or defense either). The only people who could possibly use this ring is a prot spec'd warrior or a feral druid who uses bear form the majority of the time. Just because most classes are classified into tank/healer/dps, there IS such a thing as hybrid. 1.8 will show everyone.<br /><br />It's 506 armor (for the druids who have stated that it's less than this, either learn math all over again, or find out more about your class because you...embarass us) for druids and it is true that the defense is only 1/3 as effective as it is for warriors. Any other statement other than the previous statement is just a plain uninformed and biased opinion, or wrong.<br /><br />All the warriors who attempt to justify why druids wouldn't want this or shouldn't get it, EVER, try out a few more classes before you think you know it all. Unlike you, our &quot;primary&quot; stat is not pre-determined until we choose the path we want to lead. I know it's hard to imagine being a class that actually has to decide for themselves what stat they want to focus on dependent on talents, but try to grasp that concept.<br /><br />And before warriors flame me, I would never roll on this ring because I don't plan on tanking, or want to, nor do I plan to play primarily in bear form. Feral cat druids don't want this either.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Oct 3 03:02:23 2005</div>

No. Let's keep looking on the stats other than the Stamina in this case.<br />Those are 110 Armor and +8 Defense. In what case does a Warlock, as an example, use the Armor and the Def? The only thing I can think of is in PVP, but that just don't cut it. <br />This ring was built for Warriors, but if anyone else wants to use it, fine.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It was mentioned earlier that druids can tank in MC.... I just tend to think that if your druid is tanking you have one of 4 problems:<br /><br />1) The druid didn't do a very good job healing to begin with.<br /><br />2) Your guild needs to recruit some more warriors.<br /><br />3) All your tanks are dead and coulda used that ring perhaps to help them stay alive.<br /><br />4) You have a druid with warrioritice, and you should reroll a melee class.<br /><br />As for all the classes. Think of item application. What % of the time will you actually be using all the benifits of this ring? Here let me help you... dont want to strain a brain cell.<br /><br />warriors - no dmg chance at range, no assist from range, can only be any good in the scrap. <br />Usage: 100% of the time<br /><br />Pallys - mainly short range, only time not in the scrap is when healing so we will say pallys could use this ring quite well also.<br /><br />Shamys - I've never played a shamy so im not the best to speak on it... but ive killed a lot of them so i would say they need more armor, more stamina, and more defense :)<br /><br />rouges - also always in the scrap but are geared for dodging and not taking dmg rather than lasting while taking dmg. Armor and Defense help but will still be cut down pretty fast in the scrap. Seems like a waste.<br /><br />hunters - rarely in melee, fights mainly with a bow or gun, but has melee as the fall back and they do not have the dodge and escape abilities of the rouge perhaps it is needed as much as rouge.<br /><br />Druids - for the love of god you don't even know how to work a sword what the hell are you thinking trying to tank? In my experience the bear tank is a last ditch effort. If your druid is getting beaten on then your tank isnt doing his job... but for the sake of differnt opinions ill put druids next on my ring list.<br /><br />Warlocks - I understand the converting HP to MP part of it. But WLs will only be using half of this rings abilities at any one time. If your warlock is being beaten on, the tank is doing something wrong. Other rings add to stamina, and if you would get one that added a little INY along with the STA, maybe you wouldnt have to drain so much health.<br /><br />Mages - I swear to god.... if i ever see a mage with this ring i will switch factions just so i can hunt your @$$</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Horde druid @ Chromaggus <br /><br />Do any of you really think I would bid on this to wear all the time? I have fire res gear, nature res gear, healing gear _AND_ tank gear.<br /><br />99% of the time I heal. The only time I go bear is when the tanks !@#$ up - and I have to taunt a mob and drag it back to the tanks. In healing gear I got 7k armor which is not alot. I cant tank in healing gear.<br /><br />However; when we do Zul'Gurub or AQ20 we take alts and casual gamers with us - often meaning we lack a tank. So instead of having an arms/fury warrior tank they are quite happy with a druid doing it, so they can do what they like most. In tanking gear I got 12k armor and around 6k hp. 332 defence and 16% dodge. Mana pool is 3300. I cant heal in tank gear.<br /><br />A druid in healing gear with this ring would be screenshotted and laughed at on the guild forum :P<br /><br />So - NO, a pure resto druid would not get this. He wouldn't want to spend DKP on it either. A partly feral druid will be encouraged to bid. A full feral druid would be expected to bid. MTs would be asked first if they got crap rings, though. The arms/fury warriors would surely save their DKP.<br /><br />Druids dont have last stand, but frenzied regeneration is real handy with AoE-taunt. We dont parry or block so we depend on the higher armor and more dodge.<br /><br />Tanked so far: Garr, Golemag add, Core Hounds, All bosses in ZG except Hakkar (is a pain since you're immune to sheeping when in bear form which is sad when you get MC'd), Anubisaths at the start of AQ40 and near Ossirian in AQ20. And every spellbinder in BWL. And ofc the five man instances.<br /><br />I got 0/15/36 (thats 15 in feral and 36 resto for you non-druids ;)<br /><br />But then again, I'm in a guild which has an 18 year age requirement...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Pretty amazing tanking stats for being an MC drop. Good ring into much harder raid content for a warrior . Also great for druid bear form/WSG flag gear, without a doubt. Druids benefit more then ever from +armor in light of the recent Dire Bear changes in 2.0.3 (imo, a buff to armor in bear form was the absolute last thing that druids needed, though).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Someone actually been in bwl yet? U can never know if there is something which needs to be off tanked and what if they have ability to polymorph a tank? then u will definitely need a druid tank. And this ring will definitely go for druids and warlocks too when tanks gets this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Now, I wouldn't roll against a warrior who wanted this, as I understand how useful it would be for them, and the good of the group.<br /><br />However, I've spent all afternoon looking through all the rings available in this game, and I can only find one ring that would be better for my character than this. That means that if I happened to get this ring, I would equip it and NEVER replace it for anything else. That has got to mean something in terms of having some right to roll.<br /><br />I still wouldn't roll against a warrior though.... hehe, I like my reputation as a fair guy and know I'd be flamed all over the server if I did!<br /><br />Can anyone suggest two rings a Warlock would be better off with though?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Most guilds or raid groups use a dkp system to distribute their MC loot anyway. I'm &quot;just&quot; a protection paladin, however I tank in MC on a regular basis - if there is a boss with adds (from Lucrifron to Majordomo), then i've tanked their adds multiple times.<br />When this ring dropped, i had enough points to get it - and did so. Call me strange if you like, but i like my role as a &quot;support tank&quot; a lot, but i bring my buffs, my dispells and my tanking abilities to the table, and this ring helps me a lot to do so. In fact, i do it better then offensive specced warriors, so my raid group asks me to tank even though those warriors are around.<br /><br />So why should i feel bad with this ring now? I'm maybe a rare breed, but there are some defense pallies who actively play a tank role, and this ring fits them fine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>imo any and all tanks (be they warriors, druids, wl's, priests, or pets) should get first dibs.<br /><br />o, and int ads spell crit, not just mana, so life tap is good and all but the int will add crit.<br /><br />now before u all start flaming me, i m only a 60 warrior so far, i hope to have a 60 of all classes so i can clarify some of these arguments with a well rounded and balanced view. Also, like some have said, you need to see from both viewpoints, if your a warrior you will most likely be biasd towards warriors, same for any class.<br /><br />Also, i have seen druids be as, if not more effective tanks than some warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>remember this is not only good for tanks 8)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>tank ring only.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>pretty clear that the druids and warlocks posting that they'd like to get this ring will either...<br /><br />a) never see MC<br /><br />or<br /><br />b) be sorely disappointed when put in their place when it drops<br /><br />Sorry, but if your guild is clearing MC, they could give a damn about how much this will help in PvP. The purpose of gearing up through the instance is to take on higher content. Not so you can get 396 armor in bear form, which you will never, ever use in MC/BWL etc. If it was rotting, you might get it. But believe that all the tanks will get one first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wheres the spirit? intellect? hmm? thats right, there is none. this is an epic item, if it was meant for either of those classes, it would have class appropriate stats, plain and simple. I could see this going to a pally or shaman but mostly this will go to warriors.<br /><br />and im sorry but no one cares about druid bear form armor % bonus because quite frankly a druid or warlock will not be tanking MC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>okey, druid druid druid, 110 nothing! but in bear its around 400 it atleast something! and stamina = who doesnt want that? defence who want ppl critting at them ;) prolly really good for tankers but I think its for druid in first hand. but I havent got any -.- our guild have got 2 and the tankers did &quot;steal&quot; them &gt;.&lt;</div>
