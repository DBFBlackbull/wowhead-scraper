<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So essentially, by the time you're likely to pick these up from a drop, you're too high a level to be interested in the magic items they let you craft?<br />Great.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Go to Feleras (lvl 42-45 mobs) and to the northern point of the Isle of Dread. There are mobs of Naga types that drop clams. I got a golden pearl, 3 iridescent pearls, and a black pearl in a hour of hammering. There is also some good mining in the cave there. Just don't let anybody know that I told you this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Drops from Naga Explorer near Nek'mani Wellspring in Stranglethorn Vale .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I finally got one of these form a drop @ Blackfathom Deeps, from one of the beasties there.<br /><br />Otherwise, I just watch the AH for a deal.<br /><br />Wratha - Skywall</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After buying four of these in the auction house and reading the comments here, I went to the wetlands and killed Murlocks for hours to see if getting an iridescent pearl naturally was even possible.&nbsp; Also, I thought that the giant clams under the water just off the coast seemed like the logical place to find them.&nbsp; I would say that I got a clam off of every third-ish murlock I killed, and I had about twenty of them before I opened them all to find two small lustrous pearls and one iridescent pearl!&nbsp; I never found anything but clam meat in the giant clams on the sea floor, opened about ten of those.&nbsp; Glad I found one naturally, was spending too much time in the auction house looking for these!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went back to the wetlands today in search of another iridescent pearl.&nbsp; I found one in the second giant clam that I found on the sea floor.&nbsp; I also slayed Merlocks for hours and collected 27 hard shelled clams.&nbsp; I waited to open them all at once so that I wouldn't get frustrated with finding only clam meat.&nbsp; Long story short: 27 hard clams + 3 Giant clams (on sea floor) equaled two small lustrous pearls and that one iridescent (yes, the one I found right away).&nbsp; It's still a pain in the butt, I'm still bidding on them in the auction house because they're so useful, but now I've found two iridescent pearls in two days on the wetlands coast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to confirm, you can in fact get this from the turtles in the river just east of southshore.&nbsp; I ran it about 3 times and found 1 pearl.&nbsp; They're in the thick shell clams they drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Farming for iridescent pearls is what makes the small lustrous pearls so ludicrously cheap in AH, because you pull out three of these for every iridescent pearl found in a clam.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you come out of Booty Bay and make a left towards to Bloodsail Camp.&nbsp; Then when you get to the camp make a right and go over the bridge.&nbsp; Stick to the shore and go north until you reach the NAGA.&nbsp; When you kill them they drop the clams.&nbsp; Out of 15 clams got 2 Irridecent and 1 black pearl.<br /><br />Good drop rate and easy to farm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I thought pearls come from oysters not clams?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>WEll, as these were the highest drop rate and I wanted some and didnt want to pay a gold or so each, thought I'd see how tough it was to find em in Giant clams.<br /><br />First..westfall..they drop Clam meat. so thinking you will only get Small lusterous pearls from those.<br /><br />Then tried Wetlands, out of the 5? or so Clams I opened I got 1 Iridescent Pearl, and they all had Tangy clam meat..one dropped 3 meat.<br /><br />So likely..anyone that has Tangy meat will drop it.<br /><br />As someone mentioned.the ones in STV..though I havent farmed those myself..seem to drop Blue Pearls.<br /><br />1 pearl for 10 mins swimming and every 5 Giant clams is not too much work for me..I'll try again and see if I was just lucky.<br /><br />Other reports of What type area/clam meat and what pearl you get would be Great.</div>
