I stood on the pedestal in the center of the building and would pull the Oracles if up and then the Pincers if no Oracles were up.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been farming for about 2 hours and nothing yet. But i have seen a pattern where the oracles spawn. First of if you kill a pincer or something there is a chance of an oracle to spawn in its place. that said here are some of the spots i've noticed them spawn more than others.<br /><br />1st: outside of the main door to the left of it. sometimes a pincer spawns but oracles spawn too.<br /><br />2nd: on the bridge looking at the temple, you can see 2 pillar things to the either side of the bridge, if you're on the bridge running to the temple after the pillar if you look down right between the pillar foundation and temple foundation is another spawn point.<br /><br />3rd: inside the temple on the left half of the temple is where they spawn, killed alot of pincers and other on the right half but no oracles. so once inside stick to killing on the left side. the area is begining with the small steps leading to the pool circling around (going left) to the other side of the pool.<br /><br />Also pathers never spawn oracles. so don't bother with them.<br /><br />hope this helps someone get this pattern. i'm still trying :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>has something happened during a patch or update or something? i've been farming in and around the temple killing everything (pincers are on spawn rotation with oracles) for a week straight with no drop. started at level 53 and am almost 55 now :(<br /><br />if anyone gets this pattern on wildhammer, i'll make them one and split the costs of mats. send an in-game tell if alliance-side or post here if horde-side.<br /><br />fayde<br />NE rogue<br />wildhammer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Went up to Azshara to find Duke Hydraxis and while nailing murlocson the way there I got two of these patterns in the span of about a half hour. And me, having a miner/blacksmith pick these up - Go figure!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just bought this for 75 silvers. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got this from an elite rare spawn named scalebeard first kill</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It droped on 332nd kill, minutes after I lvled to 57. The platform on the right, behind the columns. Also 230 pincers, 45 patrols</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lag.. accidental double post<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jan 23 22:24:23 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this takes ages, i've been here almost 7 hours no and no pattern.. lots of the 0.01% drops have dropped, but not the pattern, i think the 1.03% drop is too high tbh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was out grinding in azshara, Killing the lobster men.. So yeah, the stormshroud plans dropped, immediately followed by the Eye of Flame.. 0_0</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been farming for a combined 15 hours now, lots of golden pearls have droped, and those are suppose to be 0.02%? <br /><br />maybe 700 mobs killed. Got me from 58 to 59.5, I'm just going to grind them until 60, if I don't find it I'll employ the population of china to make sure there is someone in every inch of that temple killing things as they spawn.<br /><br />#$%^ing retarded drop rate.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Mar 26 20:48:31 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It just dropped of the 8th oracle I killed. Solo'ed at lvl54 rogue. Just stealted around the other buggers. Im a happy leatherworker :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Stormshroud set is Rogue Heaven. I sell each piece for about 75G. I get lucky and catch an elemenatal invasion and get 5-10 air in 2 hours. Water is easy to get. <br />I farmed for this pattern and got it on the third kill. This dropped of a servant, not an oracle. This used up all my WoW luck for the next three months.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Aug 18 01:23:10 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got this on my 237th oracle kill. Just keep clearing the mobs that are not patrols to get them to respawn, you'll get it eventually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Nine hours spent farming the temple in the last few days. About 7 green drops of varying quality, 12 various pearls, a tribal leatherworking pattern and hundreds of Zesty Clam Meat.<br /><br />I'm rather angry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>hehe.. I was killing an oracle and noticed they could respawn as 3 other kinds or something.. I gave up and mounted.. then i spotted another one.. decided to kill it.. got the pattern.. 2nd kill ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farmed them for 3-5hours a day for the last 10days, no drop as of yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>way to go blizzard, it seems like they want to screw elemental leatherworking with these horrible drop rates</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>about an hour and i got 2 of theese. but i want stupid golden pearls</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just got this on my 89th kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was swimming up to a thorium vein and one of these guys aggroed me. Easy kill and dropped these plans. Lucky drop for for me :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farmed this for about two hours today on my level 70 FC Druid so I can create the set for my Rogue. Decided to just stay inside the temple as the respawn rate is pretty quick. Ran around and aggroed five-six mobs at a time, and just swipe-spammed them. Like I said, spawn rate is pretty fast, and you want to kill all of them so that you can have a better number of Oracles spawn the next time around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Four of us (Level 54-57) farmed the temple and surrounding area for 3 straight hours today. I approximate around 200 Oracles slain and no Pattern dropped. Another 2 hours of killing Sons of Akkoroc after that and no drop either. Very, very frustrating...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>edit: I finally got it, just stick to farming them for a while and you'll eventually get it<br /><br />Edited, Tue Jan 24 11:57:44 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got it on my 18th Oracle. It was just &quot;oh one more before bed&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>3 dropped within about half an hour for me. The drop rate is correct most likely</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>geez guess i just have the worst luck ever... finally got it tonight so if anyone wants one, send me a tell.<br /><br />fayde<br />NE rogue<br />wildhammer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I hate this kinda stuff... grind for 3 hrs, kill atleast 150 of them... 1% up my ass &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>mats are <br />Requires Rugged Leather (16), Essence of Water (3), Essence of Air (3), Cured Rugged Hide, Rune Thread</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think the drop rate is completly random, or the area is easy bugged, I was at about 195 oracle kills when I quit, although for the few days I was farming, I kept seeing the same dead crab around the back, it woulnd't respawn or dissapear. <br /><br />After the patch I went hunting again, still counting on last kills <br /><br />196 - Nothing<br />197 - Nothing<br />198 - Nothing<br />199 - Nothing <br />200 - Droped<br />201 - Nothing<br />202 - Nothing<br />203 - Droped<br /><br />very bad system, I would much rather have found just 1 in my first 100 kills.<br /><br />so close to 800 kills around that zone to get them, and that is no joke for a pally.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got both this and the shoulders in 20mins.<br /><br />3rd kill for shoulders, about 15th for armor..<br /><br />omw to silithus to get the gloves :D<br /><br />dunno if i did anything special, but i did clear the temple (of oracles) before this dropped, and ofc i showed my muscles to arkkoroc himself :p<br /><br />Edited, Wed Apr 19 07:07:04 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol some guy was selling this thing in the Gadgetzam AH for a 12G BO.... its in the hands of a VERY lucky Elemental Leatherworker ME</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>stupoid murlocs, been killing them for 3 days now, hate them, hate them, hate them! killed over 1000 oracles now and i still don't have the freaking Stormshroud pattern!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The 1% drop is way off, have spent close to 9 hours with out one dropping, makes me want to toss my box out the window.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>... Got mine on the third Oracle... Took maybe... Five minutes... &gt;_&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>my brother killed that one three headed water monster, and then killed that son, then it dropped the pattern. he got both, armor and houlders, after killen that sea thing and then the son/oracle</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Me and a friend farmed around the temple for about 3-4 hours to get Golden pearls. We got 4(!) of this pattern. So, 1/hour. Guess we killed around 400 mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>about 5 minutes, was just riding through azshara and ran into some mobs that dazed me, almost didn't loot them either, about 7 mobs killed and I got it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Been killing these oracle and pincer for about 2 hours now, only thing I got was some big clams and a few silver for each kill. Clam gave me 2 black pearl and 1 iridescent pearl. Wow, what a good farming night......doh!<br /><br />I'm a LVL 60 Hunter Elemental LW. Kinda need this pattern to make me some money. So I'll continue grinding and hope for the best, but I know the worst will happen....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cracklingice</b></h3>Level 60 Resto Shaman<br />Took me about 8 hours of farming to get this pattern. My observations and technique: It seems that the Pincers and Oracles share the same spawn locations and the red murlocs and Clackers share the same spawn locations. I stood on the pedestal in the center of the building and would pull the Oracles if up and then the Pincers if no Oracles were up. I can confirm that Oracles seemed to spawn at any location in the room that had a Pincer so you are not limited to one side as I saw suggested in another comment.<br />If farming with a friend, I would have the lower damage output of the two outside the building killing only the oracles to try to force more Oracles to spawn in the building where the mob density is higher. The second floor of the building only has 4 mobs. 3 of them can be oracles, 1 cannot.<br />Good luck with your farm if you cannot just buy it from the auction house. If you can just buy it from the auction house and have a way to make that much gold faster than the farm, I'd strongly suggest that instead.</div>
