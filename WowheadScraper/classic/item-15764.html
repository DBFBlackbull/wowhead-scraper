Just swim out into the bay of storms in azshara, then find the sons (can't miss them, they are giants with big hammers). Then basically you can either solo them if you are a warlock, balance druid, or mage or 2 man if you are a meleer (bring a healer). From what i have seen you can find one of these bad boys in a half an hour of actively fighting the sons, sometimes less.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KingRamsesIII</b></h3>The Sons of Arkkoroc share spawns with the Servants of Arkkoroc. If you're farming the pattern, it's best to just kill all of the giants, giving you more Son spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>People like me are the ones who lower these rates; it took me about 50 of them before I got one =\<br /><br />Fortunately, I was able to find a nice trick to preserve my sanity.&nbsp; Down on the island below the Bay of Storms with the 3 friendly felhounds, you will find 4 giants: one to the left, one to the right, on at the front, and one behind the cave.&nbsp; Use a ranged weapon to pull them, run to the hounds, and they will help you.&nbsp; Note that you have to keep attacking, because if the hounds do most of the work you won't get to loot it.<br /><br />I did this as a rogue, and I'm assuming that everyone who wants this pattern is a rogue.&nbsp; You may have a hard time tanking the giant all the way to the island, so swim backwards and gouge over and over again until you reach it.&nbsp; Once there, use Feint to make the aggro go to the felhounds so you won't have to worry about tanking the damage.<br /><br />If you do all this correctly, you shouldn't have any problem at all going around in circles to kill the four giants repeatedly until you obtain the drop.&nbsp; The Sons and the Servants share the same spawn points, so even though you don't need to kill Servants, you should do it to spawn the Sons.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've now killed 110 Son's. No drop.<br /><br />For those people that got them quickly - were you grouped? not grouped? any particular area where they dropped?<br /><br />I'm getting extremely desperate :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The felhoud trick does work very well, but I've killed about a million of these things an no luck with the pattern.&nbsp; I did get Hydralick Armor (49 Blue), 2 black pearls and a golden pearl from the giant mouth clams that the giants drop.&nbsp; Also, these giants drop much less silver than other elites of this lvl, around 6s.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just an update<br /><br />So I just got done farming the armor pattern which dropped 2 for me after 30 mins of farming so I was feeling lucky and decided to try for the shoulders.<br /><br />So I jump into the water just south of the orcale temple in the north about 64,40ish like the post above mentions as the spawn point, and sure enough I see a few giants.<br /><br />Killed 3 sons and had the pattern drop for me. <br /><br />Pretty easy to fear kite as a 59 warlock, not many things to agro underwater.&nbsp; The only thing is that these guys run FAST when feared and get out of range really quick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Coords: 60:66<br />All other information I read here is confirmed<br /><br />I was grinding these freaks for a couple of hours on two different days and nothing dropped for me. <br /><br />The first round of freaks I killed were the Sons of Arkar(whatever the name is), however respawns would produce a round of Servants of Arkar?<br /><br />Anyhow, this pattern only droms from 'Sons' so apparently you have to kill these servants off to have the group of Son's respawn. <br /><br />Anyhow, will be back on Weds to grind for this patter.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had a similar problem with the Oracles which apparently drop the pattern for chest piece. Not only did I grind them for an an hour on two different days, but these guys literally disappeared after killing them off.&nbsp; Seems like you have to kill the high agro crabs to force oracles to respawn again.....such a tedious process...<br /><br />Still no drop on either of these patterns...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was on my way Hydraxis and killed some sons on the way when this nice thing dropped.<br /><br />As mentioned a warlock can solo the giants fairly easy. The main thing is to try to keep in range and be ready to recast fear quickly as they move fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tried grinding these giants for about 2 hours or so with my 60 shaman, trying to get the pattern for my 60 rogue.&nbsp; Luring them to the felhunters, and keeping aggro on me to make sure I can loot them.&nbsp; The money is a bit above average on these drops, but that's it.&nbsp; Will have to try again later, at least my shaman can walk on water to get out there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took me 6 hrs and I estimate I killed over or around 100 Sons and Servants before this bad boy dropped. I now have the complete Stromshroud set and not only do I look like a beast but I'm critting more often, which is always nice. So it was worth it in the end.<br /><br />There are actually more than 4 spawn points for these giants, there is one to the left AND the right at the rear of the cave. Using the Gouge trick worked nicely to draw them to the island but getting the right aggro balance between yourself and the Felhunters is quite difficult.<br /><br />I was Level 55 at the time and I managed it without many problems, only dying 7 times in 6 hrs and that was only when I was badly unlucky (Gouge's repeatedly missing) or got careless.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Haven't seen this post in a long time, so I'm surprised to see so many people that've found the tip useful.&nbsp; I'm glad it's helped so many people =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Solo-farmed this using the felhound trick with my druid at level 52. Try rooting, starfiring, getting to max range, root it again when it comes toward you, and progress your way to the demon island. When you make it to the island, switch to bearform. The giant should be damaged enough so that you can loot it every time even after the dogs dps it down 75%. Careful witht he 55 elite ones though, could mean death via root resistance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It just dropped in like one or 2 kills wasn't even looking for it lol. But I just soloed it had pet tank and I tore through it pretty simple with a strategy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Had to kill around 10 of em' myself till it dropped .<br /><br />if your a hunter i suggest you pull with aimed+multi+serpent combo , i usually set up an imolate trap aswell for the nice dot . This should get 50% of the mobs health , FD and let pet tank for a while and repeat .<br /><br />by the time you find the next mob your mana will be at 50% :)<br /><br />good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>11 kills yielded the pattern. this drops from Son only.. not from Servant. I know it says so in the description up there but I wanted to make it clear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was running around with a buddy killing the giants. Killed the first giant and he dropped the pattern then after killing 2 more got another.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>was heading to duke hydraxis and noticed the elite giants, checked allakhaz for the drops and asked a friend to help me kill a few for the lucky chance of pattern drop. got two patterns in maybe 10 kills :).<br /><br />Edited, Wed May 11 07:22:42 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farmed 143 of them. No drops. At 56, on my rogue, i was takng them out fairly easy, SS spam and Evis. I throw on Evasion and they wont hit me at all then, helps if your stuns arent working. Bring pots and bandages. At 60, itll be easier, i think... but no pattern :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hrm 100+ kills and no drop yet. also i had to kill all the servents,, so that the son spawns in the place.. yet no drop yet :( so over 200 giants killed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>woooooot just bought the pattern for 1g at the horde AH! i'm a damn happy leatherworker ^^ now off to farm the SS armor of the stupid murlocs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was up in Azshara killing naga for golden pearls and figured I would give these guys a shot. I'm a lvl 60 warrior with all end game equipment, and found these guys pretty easy to kill. They have zero, seriously zero armor, and their defense is CRAP. I was critting at least 50% of the time and regularly going over 1000 on normal crits and 2000 on MS crits. They do hit hard though and would take off 25-50% of my health even though the battles only last 15 seconds. After killing a dozen or so sons, the pattern dropped, and I sold it on the AH in a few hours for 45g b/o.<br /><br />The most annoying thing about fighting these is that most of the time you have to do it in water so it limits your manueverability. This would be a problem for any casters that want the pattern because there is no way to kite them around in the water, and going toe to toe in cloth armor isn't the best idea.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you haven't already figured this out, this is a great way to bring these guys down. <br /><br />1. Find the little Island where the demon Hunter dude is.<br />2. Pull the sons and servents over to the island, and whatch them get owned.. Youll still have to attack, but just get the little zergling type things to attack them =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got mine on the forth kill, but its only off the Sons not servents</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i have spent easily 10+ hours killing these and no drop. This is ridiculous. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was on the same island last night and got it in about an hour or so. Killed about 10 of them, but I didn't use the felhounds though, that might be an option if I wanted to farm them. Was only close to death a couple of times on the 55+ ones, but otherwise managed to hold my own.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As usual I had crappy luck with this one. I lost count of my Sons of Arkkoroc kills somewhere in the 80s overall. I got the heck outta there as soon as it dropped and kissed the ground...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got lucky and got one in the 7th kill, but am still farming for the armor :\</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been killing sons as I went around fishing essence of water with my frost mage, finally got it after at least 20 over a long period of time (weeks), then killed another 2 sons and got another one :o<br /><br />Random system ftw?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First 2 kills, got 2. Friend was pissed, he must have killed 25+<br /><br />I Win.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tried the technique mentioned on thottbot ... where in you go to the island located at 61,65 and look for the friendly felhounds. Then, you look for the Sons of Arkkoroc around the island and do just enough damage to be able to get the drop (perhaps a fifth of his health gone), and then pull the giant towards the felhounds, who are elite and will help finish off the giants. <br /><br />I can only see high level pallys or warriors being able to do this without the ability to &quot;feign death&quot; like hunters and rogues can ... as the giants hit REALLY hard. I am a level 56 hunter, and I was able to use my pet to hold the giant's attention until I got his health down far enough. Don't feign until the felhounds start attacking!<br /><br />This is tedious though, as the Servants spawn just as often as the Sons ... and you can't go too far from the island or you won't be able to pull them towards the felhounds. But it worked for me, as I got the pattern off about the 20th giant I killed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I killed nearly 20 of these before i got the pattern. probably not going to sell it. Was trying if get it to drop so i can give it to a Rogue friend of mine.<br /><br />As a Warlock i find killing them pretty easy unless there aint some lag that has usually been the case and not too much resists that will cause some serious trouble.<br /><br />Heres what i do while fighting Son of Arkkoroc:<br />( First killed few lvls past 50, Affliction spec)<br /><br />1. I dont use pet for anything else than mana (using Affliction Dark Pact skill) only make them attack at the end. Usually have Succubus or Imp out.<br />2. Make and use Soul/Health stones.<br />3. Start the fight of with a fear<br />4. Then cast Curse of Agony, Corruption and Siphon Life. Depending on the direction where it goes i cast Immolate if its in range.<br />5. When it gets near i might cast Curse of Exhaustion to slow it down (during this time swinning backwards to keep the distance) followed by a new fear. Usually just cast the fear although i might have to take a hit or two in the bad case.<br />6. Repeat this pattern until its dead. In the end use probably more Destruction spells.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jan 5 19:39:10 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>my brother killed that one three headed water monster, and then killed that son, then it dropped the pattern. he got both, armor and houlders, after killen that sea thing and then the son/oracle</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yep it's a HUGE problem to be unable to kite them. I almost every time has to use the felhunters on the island, but sometimes the sons are too far away... might be able to kill them if they are close to land or there is a kinda big island near or if I get really lucky with impacts/crits. No pattern yet.. don't want to spend 50G for a pattern for my rogue &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just bought my pattern at the AH for 2g ya 2g, and thats about all they are worth. 2 of any class can take these Elites easy, and most can solo them.<br /><br />The pattern is a 5% drop on a normal elite why the hell would you pay 60g for it!<br /><br />...then good luck making any money selling the Stormshroud set...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was swimming to get the hydraxian waterlords quest, saw one, solo'd it and bam dropped this pattern, easy money</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>as a 57 rogue, i found taking these guys down with cheap shot, backstab, guoge, backstab, eviscerate, guoge...with a couple of sinister strikes thrown in...and when things got close i used evasion.<br /><br />they do hit hard, 500 average with 1000+ critical, but they stun, so they are pretty easy.<br /><br />as a back up i used blind and runecloth bandage, tried not to use preperation on every son due to cooldown, but used if required, followed by another evasion...<br /><br />unfortunately i killed about 10 of these with no drop, found it difficult in the water. didnt go back until i was 60 due to other quests...<br /><br />got some greater underwater breathing potions off a guildy, had 1 hour without any worries of drowning. went back with a warrior and we killed 20 in 1 hour , need to kill servants to get sons to respawn though. the pattern dropped, and i have full set on EU Thunderhorn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Its because of these posts with people getting the drop so rapidly that I continue to be hopeful that I will get it. It would be my final piece to complete this set. I am 4 hours into my 3 straight day. I am using the felhounds with constant pulls. All I have is some runecloth to show for my efforts. So frustrated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a level 54 Rogue, I was able to kill four Sons and get the pattern.
