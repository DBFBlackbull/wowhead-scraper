You have to leave group in the dungeon (which starts a timer that will hearth you from the instance), then use petri (which will make you invulnerable until the hearth happens). If you use petri before you leave group or without waiting long enough after leaving, it is possible to need to use another petri, or health pot and run at the end or use abilities that may have come off cooldown, etc. before the hearth timer finishes. This is known as \"roaching out\" and should only be used as a last resort. You might get some angry whispers if you use it and someone that stuck around dies. Most of the time it is easy to tell when a pull has gone wrong and you will die if you do not petri though. You will probably still get angry whispers in this situation but you will be alive and well while they are killing boars again in Durotar or Elwynn Forest.

Otherwise, your either stupidly rich, or just stupid, to be using 30 Stonescale Oils <b> AND </b> a Black Lotus for <b> ONE</b> potion.<br /><br />This, however, has many uses in PvE, but again, there so situational and rare, that it's probably not even worth keeping a few of these handy in your bag for that situation.<br /><br />Let me just spell out the costs of this flask;<br /><br />Black Lotus - 18-30G (Extremely Old servers will sell them much cheaper)<br /><br />Stonescale Eels - 3-5G for a 5 stack.<br /><br />Mountain SilverSage - 5-25G (Server prices really do play affect on this particular herb, I actually managed to sell a 60 stack for 50G on Ve.Co)<br /><br />Now assuming that you pick up these mats for bare minimum price, your paying at least 29G per potion,and you have to run either BWL or Scholo just to brew it. Which can take up to half and hour for Scholo, and GOD knows how long for BWL.<br /><br />To emphasise the point of how worthless this potion really is, this has dropped 3 times in our guild runs, NOT ONE Alchemist has taken it, and it was subsequently sold for 40G, 36G, and 42G on the AH.<br /><br />Unlike other expensive consumables (e.g. Arcanite Bomb), this <b>truly</b> is a waste of time, effort and money.<br /><br />At least you cant devestate people in PvP with the Arcanite Bomb (Provided you use it very well), this thing just gives you a non-class Ice Block.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For that 60 seconds, can you get hit (but take no damage), thus serving as a tank? Or, do the mobs simply ignore you when you're stone?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If Mobs/Bosses don't turn their backs on you when using this, maybe this can be of some use in big encounters like Patchwerk for the maintank.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>as it is, the mobs that were attacking you will go to the rest of your party when you cast this and come back to you when the other people on aggro list are dead.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>But if this is not for tanking, when exactly is it usefull? It's used like hunters use feign death?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>priapus</b></h3>Since no one has mentioned this in the comments, the reason this &quot;useless&quot; potion in 2006 is now invaluable on modern Hard Core servers is because you can basically bubble hearth if you use it correctly in a dungeon or raid. You have to leave group in the dungeon (which starts a timer that will hearth you from the instance), then use petri (which will make you invulnerable until the hearth happens). If you use petri before you leave group or without waiting long enough after leaving, it is possible to need to use another petri, or health pot and run at the end or use abilities that may have come off cooldown, etc. before the hearth timer finishes. This is known as &quot;roaching out&quot; and should only be used as a last resort. You might get some angry whispers if you use it and someone that stuck around dies. Most of the time it is easy to tell when a pull has gone wrong and you will die if you do not petri though. You will probably still get angry whispers in this situation but you will be alive and well while they are killing boars again in Durotar or Elwynn Forest. Good Luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>megoobi</b></h3>Haven't been able to find info on this so I'll ask here. I left party and didn't get the timer CD for leaving the instance. I waited and waited but ended up having to petri twice. Still no timer CD to port out. During this time my hunter pet took aggro and was killed - if my pet takes aggro after I leave the party, will I not be able to leave the instance?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tolstan</b></h3>Comrades, can you tell me if this item is still in addition to the Wrath of the Lich King? Is it possible to make it in 3.3.5 or has it been removed? I will be immensely grateful for the answer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LastSighLZ</b></h3>Comment from <a href="https://discord.gg/FFtZKme2">Stiches HC (EUR) discord</a> for HARDCORE players:<br /><br />HOW TO USE PETRI AND BE SAFE:<br />In dungeons simply drink the petri, quickly check your buffs that you have it and alt + f4 or click the X to close the application if you're playing in windowed mode - DO NOT BIND PETRI TO F4 IF YOU USE ALT + F4 OR YOU WILL CLICK THE BUFF OFF AS YOU CLOSE WOW - It usually takes 45-55 seconds to get force logged out so DON'T waste time looking around before closing the game - ALWAYS drink petri --&gt; check that you have the buff quickly --&gt; alt + f4 or close the application with X immediately.<br />Wait AT LEAST 6 minutes to be safe OR use character unstuck service on blizzards website to be sent back to the beginning of the dungeon.<br /><br />In the open world remember that you cannot get ported anywhere no matter how long you're logged out. If you petri and then alt + f4 you're gonna be stuck where you get logged out - if you use the character unstuck on the website THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF YOU BEING SENT TO ENEMY TERRITORY - the best thing to do is to petri somewhere mobs won't wander so you're safe since petri drops combat and threat.<br /><br />Some notes:<br />Petri essentially works as a feign death - it drops threat completely AND combat<br />This is very straight foward in the open world since mobs do NOT aggro by proximity while evading<br />This is however not the case inside dungeons where unlike in the open world mobs WILL re-aggro by proximity (you being too close)<br />For this reason petri + alt f4/close wow is the SAFEST (and cheapest) way to survive - its the same procedure every time - no need to time a second petri because you were slow at leaving group while 10 mobs are pounding on you - its ALWAYS static<br />You do NOT need to leave group or anything to get a timer if you petri + alt f4 - it doesn't even matter if you're not in a group/raid<br />Disabling addons when logging back in to speed up loading screen is also a good idea<br /><br />alot of people die unnececary deaths hopefully with this post there can be some clarity for the people that were not aware of this<br />stay safe out there!</div>
