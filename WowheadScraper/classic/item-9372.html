I was lucky with Antul, he dropped the sword after about 10 runs.. From lv 49 till 53 I did straight ZF runs and finally the chief boss dropped it (i must of done 40-50 runs in total). Funny thing was my cousin just picked it up an hour before I did :). What are odds lol. There is a little trick to getting this sword, you can avoid most of the instance by mounting up at the begginning and riding all the way to the pyramid and jumping to the ledge on the side :), the mob will reset- clear part of the ground near the steps of the pyramid so when you do the 100 man war they dont run up and and attack. When the war is over speak to the goblin and he will blow up the gate that leads to the chief- avoid the fight with NPC's its just time consuming. You will need to kill 2 patrols walking through the passage and they walk in single file so you will need to fight them both at the same time. When you come to the exit where the chief is you can avoid fighting the lizards on the sides by just running past them, run to the boss and take him and his guard out and pray he drops it. IF you can get a lv 60 frost mage it makes the 100 man war very easy, he runs down freezes the whole mob and then ice shards them till theyre dead (he will need a healer) if it gets sticky, he will have to do that 3 times but if done right the war finishes in 2 minutes rather then 10. Dont let anyone tell you the sword isnt worth it, its an awesome sword which has 2 orbs that sprial around the end of the blade, does fantatsic damage and it decreases the enemies strength and does a heap of shadow damage- I put fiery enchant on it +40 so its owning atm :) with all the damage attributes it has- im a pally so seal of righteousness is giving me just over 100 additional damage as well at lv 53- All up im doing about 400 damage a hit and if i get the damage attributes kicking in and a crit its wll over 700 :). Me and a 60 had the run down to about 15-20 minutes so once you find your groove and understand how to do it, it will only take a couple of days :).

This is purely due to the abnormally high [b]PPM[\/b] of the chance on hit effect. Based on my personal experimentation this thing procs [b]2.5[\/b] per minute. When testing this sword on level 50 mobs I had it proc on practically every single encounter.\n\nThe Shadow damage caused by it is also obviously unmitigated by armor. It can be resisted, though.\n\nThe -15 Strength debuff goes off all the time, and it translates into a -30 AP decrease for your target. We know that +14 AP equates to 1 DPS, so the proc effectively reduces your target's DPS by [b]2.14[\/b]. While the Strength reduction is low, it does make a difference in the long term: in 60 seconds of active debuffs on your target you would have reduced your physical damage taken by [b]128-129[\/b] thanks to it.\n\n[code]Average instant damage\/proc: (90+210)\/2 = 150\nAdditional DoT damage\/proc = 125\nProcs per minute = ~2.5\nAdditional DPS increase from proc: (150*2.5\/60)+(125*2.5\/60) = 6.25+5.21 = 11.46\nWeapon's total DPS: 11.46+52.12 = 63.58[\/code]\n\nAs we see based on the simple calculations above, the weapon's true DPS stands at [b]63.58[\/b]. When compared to the popular [item=19106], Sul'thraze's total DPS easily ekes ahead. Obviously the speed is still going to be an issue that renders it clearly worse than the polearm for cleaving. The speed also makes it unappealing to Retribution Paladins using [spell=20375], but the sword's chance-on-hit effect more than makes up for that.\n\nIn summary, Sul'thraze is a fine weapon at 50 and for a few levels forwards, but you shouldn't spend an inordinate amount of time trying to obtain it nor should you invest large amounts of gold in enchanting it. Essentially a [item=9418] from Archaedas outperforms it in cleaves. However, if AV weekends don't line up for you in the 51-60 leveling process, this sword could easily take you all the way to 60 and you wouldn't feel totally useless carrying it. It's also worth noting that most Warriors and Paladins on the Alliance side are Humans, and their +5 Sword skill racial synergizes well with this sword.\n\nBesides, when you get your IBS at 51, you'd still have to grind your Polearm skill from 1 to 255, and as a Warrior you'd have to repick your talents for [spell=12833]. With two-handed swords, axes or maces you have clear weapon progression paths from 30 to 60 allowing you to stick to your spec and to rarely (if ever) having to spend time Hamstring-spamming low level mobs to get your weapon skill up.\n\nAll in all, I would be stoked to get my hands on this weapon while leveling, but I wouldn't run Zul'Farrak any more than is required for the completion of all quests and to satisfy my thirst for killing trolls. I obtained this on my Paladin before reaching level 60 when I went to help guild mates finish their ZF run, but I never replaced by IBS with it. After I did a sufficient amount of testing to determine the PPM of this thing at 60, I now, in hindsight, would have to reconsider that decision. I mean, IBS sometimes deals more damage, but Sul'thraze performs more predictably -- this just means you have to use [spell=20292] and preferably [spell=20332] instead of SoC.","date":"2023-04-13T13:45:42-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2023-09-03T15:24:13-05:00",7,"kurji"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":156,"id":5730593,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"asdasdasd9001","body":"The components will be hr in sod.","date":"2023-11-17T19:46:00-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":157,"id":5745297,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Shamone","body":"Something to note.\r\nThe 2 swords that combine to make this can be equiped as low as level 46 (maybe even lower), but to equip this combined sword you need to be level 50.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Haxpes</b></h3>This weapon is really hard to get unleast you are lucky one :) It took for me 25 runs to get both parts.<br />For my opinion this is really good weapon to grind from 50 to 60, an it's better than IBS.<br /><br />Proc rate is about 2-3 ppm, so it adds 9-13 dps to this weapon, plus this damage is not mitigated by armor.<br />For me it procs every fight.<br /><br />If we add into account IBS's stats, total DPS of IBS will be about 55.75, but this damage is reduced by armor.<br />Sul'thraze has 52.1 + 9-13 dps which is higher.<br /><br />And this weapon looks AMAZING :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crazytroll</b></h3>Started doin ZF at lvl 43 and saw the sword that drop's of Antu Sul a couple of times before I got it at 47. At 51 a 70 troll shammy ran me and a couple kids through and the protecter dropped off the guy behind the gates after you free the orc, human, dwarf, and goblin from their cages. Goblin blew up the gate we went in and the sword dropped. Good sword, but as a 53 hunter now the sword is a little useless when the ice barb spear is sitting in your bag. Ice barb has +21 agility which my hunter needs, plus it does more dps but Sul Thraz is definently an awsome weapon for show and it looks awsome in the log in screen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>36853</b></h3>This sword is fairly usefull for any class that can use 2h swords. i found that on many such as warrior, paladin and hunter that this sword is a great step up. Don't waste too much time trying to obtain it though because there are better weapons roughly 1-5 levels away.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sacredxavier</b></h3>well, whether you get the sword or not seriously depends on your luck, as you can see from the posts before....<br /><br />but seriously, unless you have a brilliant party, or a good high level runner... no point trying for it when ice barbed spear is within reach... even if the blade beats the spear... <br /><br />because some people have to kill seargent bly... and even if you kill the chief, you have to roll for it, against rogues and warriors, and it might not even drop.<br /><br />that's only for one of the two swords involved, to make things worse.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Both component blades are .5% drops, so it is statisticaly stupid to just try to do bunches of runs to get both, but if both do drop for you, don't worry a hunter is just going to ninja them.</div>

Got lucky while helping a guildie run through at level 53, and the one dropped off the chief. Two days later, and about 16 runs, the other drops for me. It was so totally worth it. I wouldn't try to farm both pieces, but if the chief drops his, go for it. The chiefs sword is more difficult to get, as I understand it there isn't a way to avoid doing the stupid &quot;200 troll event&quot;, and the basilisk guy is easily farmable &lt;did it with a 55 paladin and 60 priest&gt;...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A few days ago I was helping 2 friends in ZF. We invited a warrior just to help as many as possible. The warrior told us about 2 swords you could combine to 1 epic sword. We didn't know anything about that, but when we came to Antu'sul the first sword drops. When we came to Chief the other one dropped. The warrior got them both and made it to Sul'thraze the Lasher. Pretty anoying because I have a lvl 46 warrior on another server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Today on 3/8/07 I got a whisp bout if I would like to come and run ZF. I thought about it for a sec looked at the clock and thought what the heck. This was my first time running ZF on my lvl 47 Belf pally so i was hoping to get some good gear. about 10 min into the run a Percisialy Calibrated Broomstick drops so that was really cool, i lost the roll of course with my bad luck. So we get to the first boss and easily beat him and what do ya know the first sword drops. I knowing what it was instantly rolled need. In my group was another Belf pally who asked to roll need and did but amazingly i won the roll by 8. Which got me smiling and wishing and praying that the next sword would drop sometime when sul' thaze would actually be of use to me. But we worked our way through the instance with ease and we finally get to the final boss. By this time i know the odds our against me but, i was really hoping for some big bad pauldrens. We drop the boss in a matter of secs and i go to see what dropped then all the sudden my jaw dropped... There on my screen was the second sword. I was speechless. I am most thankful that I had a group that automatically all passed on the sword and gave it to me. The other Belf Pally Wuzzi whom i have the upmost respect now made my day. Thank-you and good luck to everyone in their search for the swords..<br /><br />Boxer<br />Level 47 Blood Elf <br />Paladin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well I finally got both swords! I was lucky with Antul, he dropped the sword after about 10 runs.. From lv 49 till 53 I did straight ZF runs and finally the chief boss dropped it (i must of done 40-50 runs in total). Funny thing was my cousin just picked it up an hour before I did :). What are odds lol. There is a little trick to getting this sword, you can avoid most of the instance by mounting up at the begginning and riding all the way to the pyramid and jumping to the ledge on the side :), the mob will reset- clear part of the ground near the steps of the pyramid so when you do the 100 man war they dont run up and and attack. When the war is over speak to the goblin and he will blow up the gate that leads to the chief- avoid the fight with NPC's its just time consuming. You will need to kill 2 patrols walking through the passage and they walk in single file so you will need to fight them both at the same time. When you come to the exit where the chief is you can avoid fighting the lizards on the sides by just running past them, run to the boss and take him and his guard out and pray he drops it. IF you can get a lv 60 frost mage it makes the 100 man war very easy, he runs down freezes the whole mob and then ice shards them till theyre dead (he will need a healer) if it gets sticky, he will have to do that 3 times but if done right the war finishes in 2 minutes rather then 10. Dont let anyone tell you the sword isnt worth it, its an awesome sword which has 2 orbs that sprial around the end of the blade, does fantatsic damage and it decreases the enemies strength and does a heap of shadow damage- I put fiery enchant on it +40 so its owning atm :) with all the damage attributes it has- im a pally so seal of righteousness is giving me just over 100 additional damage as well at lv 53- All up im doing about 400 damage a hit and if i get the damage attributes kicking in and a crit its wll over 700 :). Me and a 60 had the run down to about 15-20 minutes so once you find your groove and understand how to do it, it will only take a couple of days :). Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you'd just wait one more level, you can get Ice Barbed Spear just for winning AV once. It has more DPS, better stats, and is slower for MS warriors and SoC pallies. The only thing you lose is the proc, which isn't too great and not very reliable. If you get lucky and obtain both swords, then go ahead and enjoy this baby, but there's really no need to go out of your way to get this when IBS is better and easier to obtain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>to ryohzk yes you can still have. all you need to do is equip jang'thraze the protector and right click it while it is in your inventory. you will be creating it. then you have the sword. i am a pally and i have it. just check out my profile.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Eugh, a spear... nothing less suitable for me. And of course I'm talking about the Ice Barbed Spear mentioned before. Really, it's not always for something being better technically. It's the feeling. To hell with spears, axes, maces and whatnot, my Night Elf warrior uses swords, and swords only! (Yeah, noone's interested, I know...)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LOL-56 runs and now ur...what 51-52 something like that right? Yeah now do AV and get IBS and kiss ur sword goodbye.U just wasted so much time to use it for one lvl...ah the pain u must feel. It does look cool(i have it). I got it in 5 runs at most and boom i was 50 and used it one lvl and DE it and got IBS. Guys do not grind for this sword-its not worth it, u use it for one lvl and vendor it or DE it. I was very lucky to get this in 5 runs but still, all this for one maybe two lvls on use...cmon guys. Be smart<br /><br />For The Horde!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This sword is amazing.<br />The very first time I ran through ZF the sang sword droppped and ofcourse, not knowing the power that it, and its brother weilded, i rolled greed with my other party members. Believ it or not i won that roll with a perfect 100, Luckey me!<br />Now the second part of the magical combination of sul'thraze, Jang'thraze, has only about a 3%(roughly) drop rate. I figured it wouldn't be too much different in likelyhood of drop as the Sang'thraze sword(5% roughly) although iwas sadly mistaken.<br />That sword caused so much hell for me, I must have run Zf over 35 times day after day hoping one day that this sword would even drop. FINALLY!<br />FINALLY Jang'thraze dropped and I had talked it over with my group and they all were nice enough to let me have it. THANK YOU. I'll never forget how badly I was shaking once I had gotten the second sword.<br />THANKS AGAIN *UKWYR*<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Afterward...This sword is SOO much more powerful than some may think it is.....(Hint: people that cannot use this sword are all envious and angry so they just claim that it sucks)<br />I was on Boat to Theramore and i decided to use my newly found 2h weapon by challenging a lvl 56 human warrior to a duel. I sicked my pet on him and hid in the shadows while my pet faught him untill his health was around half, then I charged in after one Aimed shot and one Arcane shot and one Cold eye casting. The duel lasted for another 10 second while I sliced him to bits with my Sul'thraze The LASHER!<br />lvl 50 BEAT a pretty good lvl 56! WOOHOO</div>

It tooks me lot's of runs to have it, even droped Sang'thrase the Deflector for tanking 2'nd time. When you get(as i did)60 The Unstoppable Force is 3-4 days in AV grinding. I am sure that Sul'thrase the Lasher is very nice for pallys too. BTW i am fury, very efective prock with attack speed increase.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RoshRoshan</b></h3>To people reading this during Classic and wondering just how good this epic two-hander is:<br /><br /><b>It's complete garbage.</b><br /><br /><i>&quot;But it's an epic&quot;</i> - No one cares. This is not vanilla, it's Classic. We're not kids anymore. People aren't going to be amazed by your having this weapon - they'll laugh at you for wasting your time on an epic that's worse than a same-level blue or +5lvl green.<br /><br /><i>&quot;But it has high DPS&quot;</i> - how much of an Arms warrior's damage comes from auto-attacks?<br /><br /><i>&quot;But it's good for Rets&quot;</i> - SoC has a PPM, so the faster attack speed doesn't change anything. With such a fast weapon, you will be using SoR, which is worse than SoC. Also, if you want a weapon like this, then just get <a href="/classic/item=1263/brain-hacker">Brain Hacker</a> - you'll find it cheap on the AH because no one wants it either.<br /><br /><i>&quot;But it's good for 2H Fury&quot;</i> - yeah, except that your Whirlwind will hit like a wet noodle. This weapon is a compromise pick for Fury, at best. Also, refer to the Brain Hacker note above.<br /><br />If you get Sul'thraze on your first ZF run or during your ZF farm runs while leveling, then good for you. Keep it and use it until you find a better weapon (which will happen quite soon). Literally any weapon from the list below would be better than Sul'thraze:<br /><a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/items/min-level:55/max-level:65/quality:3/slot:17?filter=36:23:51:50:41;2:4:4:4:4;3:0:0:0:0">https://classic.wowhead.com/items/min-level:55/max-level:65/quality:3/slot:17?filter=36:23:51:50:41;2:4:4:4:4;3:0:0:0:0</a><br /><br />PS - if you're a hunter, you can just vendor this. Even a 5lvl green weapon with +1 Agility would be better than this.<br />PS2 - even <a href="/classic/item=2291/kang-the-decapitator">Kang the Decapitator</a> is better than this sword, and it's 6 levels lower.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kurji</b></h3>While at first glance this weapon seems incredibly poor despite its Epic quality, it actually turns out to be <b>kind of okay</b>. This is purely due to the abnormally high <b>PPM</b> of the chance on hit effect. Based on my personal experimentation this thing procs <b>2.5</b> per minute. When testing this sword on level 50 mobs I had it proc on practically every single encounter.<br /><br />The Shadow damage caused by it is also obviously unmitigated by armor. It can be resisted, though.<br /><br />The -15 Strength debuff goes off all the time, and it translates into a -30 AP decrease for your target. We know that +14 AP equates to 1 DPS, so the proc effectively reduces your target's DPS by <b>2.14</b>. While the Strength reduction is low, it does make a difference in the long term: in 60 seconds of active debuffs on your target you would have reduced your physical damage taken by <b>128-129</b> thanks to it.<br /><br />Average instant damage/proc: (90+210)/2 = 150<br />Additional DoT damage/proc = 125<br />Procs per minute = ~2.5<br />Additional DPS increase from proc: (150*2.5/60)+(125*2.5/60) = 6.25+5.21 = 11.46<br />Weapon's total DPS: 11.46+52.12 = 63.58<br /><br />As we see based on the simple calculations above, the weapon's true DPS stands at <b>63.58</b>. When compared to the popular <a href="/classic/item=19106/ice-barbed-spear">Ice Barbed Spear</a>, Sul'thraze's total DPS easily ekes ahead. Obviously the speed is still going to be an issue that renders it clearly worse than the polearm for cleaving. The speed also makes it unappealing to Retribution Paladins using <a href="/classic/spell=20375/seal-of-command">Seal of Command</a>, but the sword's chance-on-hit effect more than makes up for that.<br /><br />In summary, Sul'thraze is a fine weapon at 50 and for a few levels forwards, but you shouldn't spend an inordinate amount of time trying to obtain it nor should you invest large amounts of gold in enchanting it. Essentially a <a href="/classic/item=9418/stoneslayer">Stoneslayer</a> from Archaedas outperforms it in cleaves. However, if AV weekends don't line up for you in the 51-60 leveling process, this sword could easily take you all the way to 60 and you wouldn't feel totally useless carrying it. It's also worth noting that most Warriors and Paladins on the Alliance side are Humans, and their +5 Sword skill racial synergizes well with this sword.<br /><br />Besides, when you get your IBS at 51, you'd still have to grind your Polearm skill from 1 to 255, and as a Warrior you'd have to repick your talents for <a href="/classic/spell=12833/polearm-specialization">Polearm Specialization</a>. With two-handed swords, axes or maces you have clear weapon progression paths from 30 to 60 allowing you to stick to your spec and to rarely (if ever) having to spend time Hamstring-spamming low level mobs to get your weapon skill up.<br /><br />All in all, I would be stoked to get my hands on this weapon while leveling, but I wouldn't run Zul'Farrak any more than is required for the completion of all quests and to satisfy my thirst for killing trolls. I obtained this on my Paladin before reaching level 60 when I went to help guild mates finish their ZF run, but I never replaced by IBS with it. After I did a sufficient amount of testing to determine the PPM of this thing at 60, I now, in hindsight, would have to reconsider that decision. I mean, IBS sometimes deals more damage, but Sul'thraze performs more predictably -- this just means you have to use <a href="/classic/spell=20292/seal-of-righteousness">Seal of Righteousness</a> and preferably <a href="/classic/spell=20332/improved-seal-of-righteousness">Improved Seal of Righteousness</a> instead of SoC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>asdasdasd9001</b></h3>The components will be hr in sod.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shamone</b></h3>Something to note.<br />The 2 swords that combine to make this can be equiped as low as level 46 (maybe even lower), but to equip this combined sword you need to be level 50. So if you have both just dual wield them until then.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vycount</b></h3>For what it's worth, in Retail time walking, this sword drops as an whole piece, not in parts, is soulbound with no vendor sell price, is rare not epic and is Explorer track at 567 ilvl at level 80.</div>
