<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Apparently in 1.9, this will be a conponent for the Tranquil Yeti (a vanity pet).&nbsp; But the E'ko items are only dropped if the player has a Cache of Mau'ari in their inventory, availible from a Horde quest only.<br /><br />Will it be changed to an Alliance-also quest in 1.9, or will this only be availible to the Alliance through Gadgetzan?&nbsp; I guess we'll have to wait and see.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A friend of mine bought me the e'ko at an outrageous price i know the alliance any better but the horde should be ashamed for price gougin like they are but anyway i built one today and i play a gnome and the thing is almost as tall as i am it rocks if anyone needs one i'll make them for free if you supply the mats look up keres on the malygos server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Listen to what ppl are saying, even if ur on PvE, you can not bid/buyout auctions u created with a horde/alliance with a character of opposite faction.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There's some for sale at AH in IF.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><i>Having talked to a GM just a moment ago (Laneroth of Feathermoon), he confirmed that there is some way that the Alliance can get these crystals, but he couldn't indicate how as that would be giving a game hint. <br /><br />But there is some way out there</i><br /><br />Well, the schematic has been altered has been changed so that it no longer requires the Ice Thistle E'ko &quot;so that both Horde and Alliance Engineers can make the recipe&quot; implying that it was impossible before for alliance to obtain Ice Thistle E'ko.<br /><br />We love being lied to. While you're at it, nerf rogues some more.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
