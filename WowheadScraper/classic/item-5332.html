First kill, he dropped the Glowing Cat Figurine.<br /><br />Thus;<br />1. You do NOT have to aquire 2 Cat Figurines before you will be able to spawn a Ghost Saber.<br />2.

The droprate of Glowing Cat Figurines are aswell low.<br /><br />All in all, it's not too low to actually farm one once in a while. but its far too low for regular farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a dwarf with my find treasure ability on, I am able to see multiple cat figurines scattered about the ruins all at the SAME time, so there are many around, and yes they were all next to rubble making them hard to spot by eye; I found at least 8 different ones while I was exploring and it was on the eighth that I finally got the ghost saber to appear, although I didnt get this glowing fig to drop for me T.T o well Im not gonna waste more time here just for a 10 minute guardian....check out Faithfade's post above with the screenshot steps, everything there is what you need to know except the very last line about there being only 1 statue at a time.<br /><br />....there are MANY statues around the ruins and they will most likely respawn in different spots each time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here is the deal. I dont know what people are talking about. In about an hour, I go the sabre to spawn 2 times. I never saw the clicky cat figurine. I got about 8 of the gray useless cat figurines.<br /><br />Upon openng the cat, getting a useless cat figuring, The Ghost sabre Spawned. The first time, due to lag and other dumb stuff I died. The second spawn,&nbsp; dropped an ice trap and I WAS ABLE to TAME him. Its somewhat comical becuse as I was fighting he dropped dead for no reasn. (the 10 minute timer) and after a revive pet, I now have a semi transparent snow leopard. He looks pretty cool, I wish he was dark. He is slower but he does a LOT of damage it seems and he comes at a level about the range you can get him. When I charmed him, the spawn was 19. I was 20 or 21? Keep your eyes open, A dwarf would have been nice but i think people are exagerating it.<br /><br />01-07-07 he is TAMEABLE</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It seems that whatever issues/bugginess around taming the ghost sabers has been resolved (either that or I just got lucky).<br /><br />Went up to the ruins with a junk pet, opened 11 cat figurines, on the last one a ghost saber spawned - promptly ditched my pet and tamed the saber first time no problems :)<br /><br />Here he is :D<br /><br /><a href="http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b362/XhiXhi/ghostsaber.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b362/XhiXhi/ghostsaber.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This cat is still tameable even in The Burning Crusades. Just go to the Ruins and open the figurines. Eventually, the ghost saber will spawn (eight figures for me). Drop a frost trap and tame him. About 5-10 minutes after he is tamed he will drop dead. Resurrect him and he is yours forever. Besides the translucent skin, he is like every other cat in the world. He isn't in stealth, so don't think this is a way around training Prowl.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hi, i was helping a lvl 22 tame 1 as as she summoned it i saw that it was semi-invisible, so the next day i went back and tamed it, when i tamed it i received <br />one Glowing Cat Figurine. So it was easy for me when i want a Figurine i just go back and tame 1 easy!. I went on the Hunter Forums on Wow.com and they said that it does happen to some of them. As a lvl 32 hunter with mine at lvl 29 its a VERY cool pet, and im not gonna ditch it for King Bang cause i have 3 stable spot so i'll have him aswell. And i got him on the first Statue so lol, it took me 1 minute cause the first place i went was down this ditch thingy and i landed on 1!<br /><br />Khazadwifi, Orc Hunter,Dath'Remar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Still nada :P Despite getting ganked a couple times by Alliance players, I'm still going to remain until I get him. That figurine is insanely hard to see.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it is tamable but you have to go thru alot of figurines to get it. the first one i did was a level 20 and it killed me in the middle of taming. rez and pick up figurine and it spawn again and i tamed the cat this one was a level 19. FYI: its not a glowing figurine its white the others are Grey. i also posted a picture of me after i tamed my pet still haven't found a good name thou. cords 61.19</div>

There are several spread all over the ruins.<br /><br />I was lvl 25 and tamed on first try (after about 25 empty idols).<br /><br />Yes - he died for no appearent reason after about 5 mins, but no problem since.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well. Easter Day and I had to leave to an Easter Egg Hunt for my lil one.&nbsp; Decided to take 5 minutes to look at figurines.&nbsp; Saw one immediately when I went into ruins.&nbsp; Opened it, out popped the cat, I tamed her.&nbsp; Her name is Lasombra (Spanish for the shadow)... she is so pretty.&nbsp; Went of to Eastern Kingdoms and got a lot of questions about her transparent nature.&nbsp; She' a keeper!&nbsp; So for me, it took me a few minutes, and one figurine.&nbsp; I've read about so many ppl on thott that got stuff first drop.&nbsp; I have joined your elite club! Woot! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These are untamable by hunters.<br /><br />I am planning a test to see if you can summon one if you are a hunter and already have a pet out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tamed one today. No different to a normal cat apart from being translucent.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 10th 2006 at 10:24pm EDT by Smiffo</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are TWO Ghost Sabers. One appears when you click on the statues that are standing around and reach in to get the cat figurine inside. This one IS TAMEABLE BY A HUNTER. If you KILL this cat, then it drops another cat figurine like the others (only glowing) and this is an expendable charge protector much alone the same lines as the yeti and hound from scarlet monestary. I have tamed the Ghost Saber (the one that is NOT summoned) twice now and so far they have not dissappeared. They are slow, but the last one came with Bite Rank 3 when I tamed it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You can find these way north in darkshore. There is a ruins by the tower of althalax. Infested with Marmydon(silithid). The cat figurines are on the ground. Right click it will open it there is a cat figurine inside...if you grab it sometimes a ghost saber will appear and attack you. My glowing figurine dropeed from the dead ghost saber.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>how after 2 years of playing a hunter in WoW is there still an incredbley unique pet like this out there? most pets are common knowledge to hunters this long after release (1.0 pets, that worg that did shadow dmg, gamooras 900k armor that doesnt stay after taming etc...) but then i read about this on hunter forums, think its complete BS and low and behold its true? omg! too bad i just tamed broken tooth for my 3rd stable slot like 2 weeks ago, otherwise id get one of these in a heartbeat even though their atk speed is sucky<br /><br />but btw, what do the statues look like? im running around, ive seen different objects scattered among the ruins that look like they could be opened or part of a quest or something...stone spheres, goblets, nelf statues...not any cat statues tho. someone post a screen!<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I finally found the cat figurine. And it is exactly what it sounds like, you can't miss it, if you were like me and thought you must be missing it someplace. They are just mini tigers, that u can loot.<br /><br />I got a spawn on my 5th statue loot, and beastial lore confirmed that it is tameable. however the mob did not drop the , which they have a 30% chance of doing, so I did not get to check if that guardian version is tameable. However I'm still at it, and going to find out some time soon hopefully...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a hunter, but I want one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found one of these today. If you're a hunter it will replace your tameable pet when you summon it and the ghost panther is -not- tameable. On top of that it's set to agro. <br /><br />The pet is level 20 and does an average of 20 dmg per hit. It will attack anything within a few meters of you. <br /><br />The timeout is 10 minutes, after that the ghost panther dies and does not re-appear in your inventory so it seems to be one-use-only.<br /><br />If you're a hunter you can have it out with your tameable pet, but you will need to re-summon your tameable pet after you've summoned the ghost panther.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>treii28</b></h3>Woah, this scares me! Someone in the guild was looking for someone to make the robes of arcana for their lock, so I said I would help try to get the recipe since my lock would eventually need it. I parked my hunter in the tower and would hop on it occasionally to clear the tower. I had cleared it about 7 times with no luck.<br /><br />I was browsing on here for rings for my newly-20 priest and saw the defias enhanters in duskwood might also drop a ring and also had that recipe as a 2% drop same as the warlocks in the tower. So after clearing the tower again, I brought my rogue down to duskwood and got it the recipe on the 4th enchanter (also 2%). I hopped back on my hunter, cleared the tower one last time, then swung over to the naga area to see if one of the rares with a possible ring was up,<br /><br />While there, I decided to pick a few cat figurines. I picked 5 and got two cat spawns. I almost didn't see the second one and was riding away when I saw the dot on the minimap due to track beasts being on. And the ghost cat dropped the figurine!<br /><br />Now I'm scared - my luck is never this good. Something bad is probably going to balance my karma now!</div>
