The eye tells the tale of a sole priest who failed in saving fleeing peasants from the onslaught of an UD invasion.\r\nyou must make up for what she could not do!\r\n\r\nFirst, head to the Stratholme area and find the NPC. She is located due west of Stratholme after passing thru a cave, on the left side. If you reach the Terrorweb tunnel, you've gone too far! She can ONLY be seen when the eye of divinity is equipped. She will tell you her tale, after which the quest will appear that if you accept, will begin the event that you must succeed in!\r\n\r\nThe Event:\r\nNote: you must keep the eye of divinity EQUIPPED for the entire duration of the event\r\n\r\nYou have to save the lives of 50 peasants before 15 die. The peasants will spawn in groups of 10 near the cave to the East. In order to %u201Csave%u201D them, the peasants must reach the area near the NPC. While the peasants are traveling from the cave to this point, they will be fired upon by UD archers which CANNOT be killed, melee%u2019d by UD warriors (which in turn melee you), and sporadically given a disease (which appears as a green cloud) that must be cured ASAP as it eats away their life very quickly.\r\n\r\nHow to beat it:\r\n\r\n(The items, buffs, and people you might want \/need when you attempt it)\r\n\r\nA group of 5 people, consisting of you, 2 paladins, a warlock and a mage the people you bring with you MUST STAND ON TOP OF THE NPC and never move, as it will cause you to fail the quest. However, from this place, the auras and such will still reach you and be of GREAT use. Granted, not all of the below things are needed, but with the 2 hour wait between attempts, it might be nice to have a good shot at it in one try. \r\n\r\nAuras:\r\nConcentration Aura OR Devotion Aura\r\nRetribution Aura\r\nBlood Pact (warlock Imp)\r\n\r\nBuffs (both spell and item buffs)\r\nImproved Fortitude\r\nInner Fire\r\nArcane Intellect\r\nMark of the Wild\r\nBlessing of Kings\r\nBlessing of Wisdom\r\nThorns Aura (or the crystal form of it from Ungoro crystal towers)\r\nDivine Spirit (or the crystal form of it from Ungoro crystal towers)\r\nCerebral Cortex Compound (+50 intellect, quest in Blasted Lands that's repeatable)\r\nRum Tum Tuber Surprise (10 int)\r\nNightfin Soup (mana \/ 5 sec regen)\r\nWildblossom berries (10 stam)","date":"2006-12-09T14:01:04-06:00","rating":41,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":1,"id":12211,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"kreghx","body":"Items\n\nOIL OF IMMOLATION (this is by far a must have to complete this quest easily!)\nMana \/ Health Potions\nDemonic Runes (sacrifices life and give you mana %u2013 from demons in felwood)\nWhipper Root Tubers (restore health - from felwood)\nNightdragon Plants(restore small health and mana - from felwood)\n\nThere are some very key things that should be noted about the event that will help you tremendously when attempting it.\n\nManually targeting the peasants to heal them can be a pain!  In order to alleviate this, make sure to have their health bars displayed above their heads (by pressing hotkey %u201CV%u201D) and also targeting them by clicking their health bars, not their bodies!\nWhen the waves of peasants spawn, there will be a few in the front of the pack that almost have a %u201Cpurple%u201D glow to them.  These peasants are extremely weak and must be cured and healed immediately or they will die.  This can easily cause the priest to fail the quest when they first attempt it, as I did.\n\nRight before the first wave of peasants reaches the safe point (and every group thereafter), the next group will spawn.  Therefore, it is imperative that you turn around and head back towards the cave and be ready to heal those weak peasants in the front first.  In addition, the second wave of peasants will cause the UD melee warriors to spawn.  I found it best to FEAR (yes they CAN be feared) this initial group of warriors as it allowed me to compose myself, heal the very weak peasants, and in turn gain their agro so they weren%u2019t targeting peasants.  I did this every time a new wave spawned.\nWhen Melee UD warriors engage you (and they will, after you pop one heal on a peasant) Activate your Oil of Immolation!  These potions have no cool down between uses and grant you the chance to deal tons of damage to melee things attacking you.  Combined with the auras listed above, the UD fighters (which don%u2019t have much health) will die after 1-2 swings at you, saving your mana from having you use it on healing yourself.\n\nIt%u2019s a good idea to hotkey Flash heal (rank 6 or 7, depending on how much  bonus +healing you have, ONE of these will fully heal the peasant), Renew rank 9, and abolish disease to keys right next to each other%u2026such as 1, 2 and 3.  These will be the only spells you will use on the peasants and you need to use them in rapid succession.  AOE heal does not work, nor do you have the time to cast a spell that long.\n\nUsing Renew on peasants around","date":"2006-12-09T14:01:48-06:00","rating":29,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":2,"id":12213,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"9019","body":"This is a great thread =) I think you may have forgotten the Peasants actually some of them are elite if i remember, might wanna bring a friend.

You CANNOT kill them. about 10 peasents will spawn, and the ones in front will have a disease on them that kills them in a couple seconds, so cure disease on them. After that, just keep casting renew on the peasents as they get attacked. After the first wave of the peasents make it to the light, head back for the next wave. You'll be attacked by melee skellies.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kreghx</b></h3>Obtain the Splinter of Nordrassil. <br />A guide to completing the Epic Priest quest event <br />By: Paladeus (Immortality Skullcrusher)<br /><br />Upon obtaining the eye of divinity from Major Domo'ss chest, the priest must equip it in order to gain a clue as to where the quest will take him. The eye tells the tale of a sole priest who failed in saving fleeing peasants from the onslaught of an UD invasion.<br />you must make up for what she could not do!<br /><br />First, head to the Stratholme area and find the NPC. She is located due west of Stratholme after passing thru a cave, on the left side. If you reach the Terrorweb tunnel, you've gone too far! She can ONLY be seen when the eye of divinity is equipped. She will tell you her tale, after which the quest will appear that if you accept, will begin the event that you must succeed in!<br /><br />The Event:<br />Note: you must keep the eye of divinity EQUIPPED for the entire duration of the event<br /><br />You have to save the lives of 50 peasants before 15 die. The peasants will spawn in groups of 10 near the cave to the East. In order to %u201Csave%u201D them, the peasants must reach the area near the NPC. While the peasants are traveling from the cave to this point, they will be fired upon by UD archers which CANNOT be killed, melee%u2019d by UD warriors (which in turn melee you), and sporadically given a disease (which appears as a green cloud) that must be cured ASAP as it eats away their life very quickly.<br /><br />How to beat it:<br /><br />(The items, buffs, and people you might want /need when you attempt it)<br /><br />A group of 5 people, consisting of you, 2 paladins, a warlock and a mage the people you bring with you MUST STAND ON TOP OF THE NPC and never move, as it will cause you to fail the quest. However, from this place, the auras and such will still reach you and be of GREAT use. Granted, not all of the below things are needed, but with the 2 hour wait between attempts, it might be nice to have a good shot at it in one try. <br /><br />Auras:<br />Concentration Aura OR Devotion Aura<br />Retribution Aura<br />Blood Pact (warlock Imp)<br /><br />Buffs (both spell and item buffs)<br />Improved Fortitude<br />Inner Fire<br />Arcane Intellect<br />Mark of the Wild<br />Blessing of Kings<br />Blessing of Wisdom<br />Thorns Aura (or the crystal form of it from Ungoro crystal towers)<br />Divine Spirit (or the crystal form of it from Ungoro crystal towers)<br />Cerebral Cortex Compound (+50 intellect, quest in Blasted Lands that's repeatable)<br />Rum Tum Tuber Surprise (10 int)<br />Nightfin Soup (mana / 5 sec regen)<br />Wildblossom berries (10 stam)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kreghx</b></h3>Items<br /><br />OIL OF IMMOLATION (this is by far a must have to complete this quest easily!)<br />Mana / Health Potions<br />Demonic Runes (sacrifices life and give you mana %u2013 from demons in felwood)<br />Whipper Root Tubers (restore health - from felwood)<br />Nightdragon Plants(restore small health and mana - from felwood)<br /><br />There are some very key things that should be noted about the event that will help you tremendously when attempting it.<br /><br />Manually targeting the peasants to heal them can be a pain! In order to alleviate this, make sure to have their health bars displayed above their heads (by pressing hotkey %u201CV%u201D) and also targeting them by clicking their health bars, not their bodies!<br />When the waves of peasants spawn, there will be a few in the front of the pack that almost have a %u201Cpurple%u201D glow to them. These peasants are extremely weak and must be cured and healed immediately or they will die. This can easily cause the priest to fail the quest when they first attempt it, as I did.<br /><br />Right before the first wave of peasants reaches the safe point (and every group thereafter), the next group will spawn. Therefore, it is imperative that you turn around and head back towards the cave and be ready to heal those weak peasants in the front first. In addition, the second wave of peasants will cause the UD melee warriors to spawn. I found it best to FEAR (yes they CAN be feared) this initial group of warriors as it allowed me to compose myself, heal the very weak peasants, and in turn gain their agro so they weren%u2019t targeting peasants. I did this every time a new wave spawned.<br />When Melee UD warriors engage you (and they will, after you pop one heal on a peasant) Activate your Oil of Immolation! These potions have no cool down between uses and grant you the chance to deal tons of damage to melee things attacking you. Combined with the auras listed above, the UD fighters (which don%u2019t have much health) will die after 1-2 swings at you, saving your mana from having you use it on healing yourself.<br /><br />It%u2019s a good idea to hotkey Flash heal (rank 6 or 7, depending on how much bonus +healing you have, ONE of these will fully heal the peasant), Renew rank 9, and abolish disease to keys right next to each other%u2026such as 1, 2 and 3. These will be the only spells you will use on the peasants and you need to use them in rapid succession. AOE heal does not work, nor do you have the time to cast a spell that long.<br /><br />Using Renew on peasants around</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9019</b></h3>This is a great thread =) I think you may have forgotten the Peasants actually some of them are elite if i remember, might wanna bring a friend. Or correct me if I'm wrong, just trying to help.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where is the eye of shadow and the eye of divinity?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>gosh why all the controversy. These are real stats, i have eye of divinity and shard, and i have seen eye of shadow drop.<br /><br />Eye of Divinity DOES drop in domo's chest (40% drop)<br />The shard is a quest item you recieve AFTER getting the Eye of Divinity.<br /><br />The quest itself:<br />Once you obtain the eye of Divinity, stock up on about 20 oil of immolations, about 10 major mana potions, maybe a couple health potions if you want, and head to the main entrance of stratholme. Make sure that your Rank 8 Renew is bound to an easiably accessable key cause you are going to use it a lot. Once your there, head west on the entrance side of the water, and go through the tunnel there. Make sure you have the eye equiped, and keep walking along the wall, and you will see a woman priest. Talk to her to begin the quest.<br /><br />The quest begins IMMEDIATELY. Head back where you came from. While you are running back a bunch of skeleton archers will spawn. You CANNOT kill them. about 10 peasents will spawn, and the ones in front will have a disease on them that kills them in a couple seconds, so cure disease on them. After that, just keep casting renew on the peasents as they get attacked. After the first wave of the peasents make it to the light, head back for the next wave. You'll be attacked by melee skellies. They have about 100hp, so use your oil of immolations and you'll be able to kill them easily in a couple seconds. After about 4 - 5 waves, you'll finish the quest.<br /><br />It's REALLY easy if you do it this way, only 3 peasents died on me. Keep in mind that if you fail the first time, it takes 2 hours for the chick to come back. Other than that, jsut keep yourself alive.</div>

And thats kinda sweet according to me:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got my benediction last night after my 6 attempt.&nbsp; I had 3 other priests besides me on the quest.&nbsp; Heres what we did.<br /><br />Each player had their Divity Eye Equiped and completed &quot;A Warning&quot; quest.<br /><br />Then 3 of us stood spread out so we can all heal the peaseants while the 4th priest accepted the quest.&nbsp; He is the only one that can move around<br /><br />The multi quest is simliar to Jailbreak, where it will ask you if you want to accept it too.<br /><br />Then DONT MOVE.&nbsp; You can heal/Decurse the peaseants but dont heal each other. I hit &quot;V&quot; to see the peaseant health, it helps. Make sure you still have immolation pots as well. Other than that I cried with joy.&nbsp; I didnt need to use a mana pot, but I wouldnt rely on that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also another note it was good to have vent to communicate<br /><br />-Mikeyo</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finished this one on my first attempt.<br /><br />The only buff i had was the Elixir of the sages which gives me 18 int &amp; 18spi.<br /><br />Along with that I used 15 oil of immolation and 3 stratholme holy water.<br /><br />The most confusing part in this was when the healthbars were all jumping and switching places. But in the end it all went pretty well. I advise you to take a look at the movie some dude above posted, to see what you will expect. Ty for that one m8!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok i finished this.. took a couple of tries for me to figure it out.. but i think i got the secret.. dont stop downing oils of immolation!..everytime one wears out down another.. they r on a seperate timer from ur other pots.. also i used a drak rune and OH SO many major mana pots... i did it with a only a SS.. i would REALLY recommend getting one for this fight.. then u can worry a lil less about urself and more on the peasents.. besides that its actually really ez..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have my benediction already on my priest.... got it awhile back ... but my question is more for guildies just getting theirs.... Do you have to have the eye of divinity to see this girl or can you still use spectral essence? Im currently camping the spot to find out but have yet to see her.... Any input would help! TY</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Confirmed as of April 23rd that this is doable without Eye of Divinity after recent patch and whatnot. I just did this quest with my priest without Eye of Divinity using Spectral Essence from Scholo only, worked like a charm :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tried last night with the ghost revealer but no joy... Couldnt see the NPC. <br />Can anyone confirm this is still do-able with the tier0.5 ghost revealer?... Hope they didn't &quot;fix&quot; it in one of the small patches since 1.10 =(<br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First off, for those saying you need the other pieces to start this quest, you don't.&nbsp; You don't use the ghost revealer from the .5 quests, you use the trinket from the scholo quests.<br /><br />I am sitting on 7/8 devout(and crappy ST pants) with hide of the wild as my only epic, and decided to try and see if I could get quest.&nbsp; Sure enough, I could.&nbsp; I went into it with only self buffs, so about 6k mana.&nbsp; I used Oil of Immolations(bout 10-15) and a few major mana pots.<br /><br />Just follow the basic strat everyone else said.&nbsp; When you see green aura around a peasant, cure disease.&nbsp; Otherwise, just use 'v' key to pop a renew on hurt peasants.&nbsp; When skels run up, drink an oil and run near em.&nbsp; I had to self heal a couple times, so used greater heal for mana efficiency.&nbsp; At end I was sitting on more than half mana and timer near up for another major mana pot.<br /><br />This was MUCH easier than I was expecting after hearing some of the horror stories.&nbsp; Don't worry too much about it and have fun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Very easy quest. <br />About the buffs and potions:<br />I used no special buffs, 1 scroll of intellect 3 buff and the +20 intellect buff from my headmasters charge staff, i have about 6k mana. The usual priest buffs: fort, spirit, inner fire<br />Had no one else helping me, no pally buffs no other class buffs. Didn't bring any Oil of Immolations or any Stratholme holy water. <br />Used rank 3 flash heal and rank 3 holy nova... Didn't shield at all. Didn't need to heal myself (holy nova did fine) and had 'v' up so I could see thier health bars. i have 2/8 prophecy but the rest are mostly stuff from scholo/ubrs etc. Used NO mana potions... (brought some anyway but i'm very good at preserving mana)<br /><br />Got it on second try, first try I didn't know what to expect and was more watching what was going on than healing/curing diseases.<br /><br />Not even much skill required to do this... just fast reactions o.o<br /><br />(haha my guild leader needed 2 people to help with his, and another priest used a ton of consumables)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>NOOOOOOoo they changed it you can't do the quest anymore without the eye of divinity the spectral essence won't work ..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this quest with another priest and we both succeded and completed this quest, since I failed my first attempt I asked around in the guild how to do this, and this is what we did:<br /><br />- 2 priests grouped up.<br /><br />- First Priest ran to the tunnel, and disabled his move buttons (if you run, you will fail, so stand put).<br /><br />- The second priest will start the quest, and run around and follow the peaseants to the finishline.<br /><br />Priest at the tunnel will cash abolish disease and renew rank 8 on the peaseants, and the second priest will do the same and follow the peaseants home. Easy as that, we did not use any special buffs besides what we had. We did not use any extra potions, but Desperate Prayer and healing potions might be good to have at hand if nesesary.<br /><br />You should bring pr. attempt if you are two in the group:<br /><br />- Around 15 Oil of Immolation<br />- 1-2 Mana potions.<br />- 1-2 Healing potions.<br /><br />I would guess another priest that dont need to complete the quest will be able to help out as well, as long as he dont run at all...<br /><br />GL! Its a hard quest solo, but with 2 priests its no problem, we didnt loose a single peaseant.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>since 1.11 the only way to do this qst is having EoD equiped,&nbsp; Others can watch you do this qst but they cant see what you see.&nbsp; tell them not to move or help,&nbsp; Mana is a big problem,&nbsp; I used Distilled Wisdom and any mana regen food or pots i could get,&nbsp; i also had dark runes, and some EZ throw dinamite&nbsp; dont forget some buffs,<br /><br />I first cleared my bar, and put renew rank 6, flash heal rank 3, abolish disease, and holy nova rank 3 in my bar,&nbsp; <br /><br />as the qst begins the first wave of peasents slowly walk out,&nbsp; Quickly abloish diseased, and renew them too, I noticed that the arrows from the archers on the hill were hitting 2 or 3 of the NPCs more then others,&nbsp; so watch who is getting hit with them and keep a renew on them&gt;&nbsp; <br />This wave is a hard wave to keep alive,i recon,&nbsp; so do you best.&nbsp; Now would be a good time to drink a mana pot or use a dark rune, then u will have enough time to have another later in this qst.<br /><br />The second wave was easy,&nbsp; one guy came out fast and i abloished disease on him and and the rest walked slow,&nbsp; but the archers didnt do much utill they moved up a bit,<br />wot made it hard was the skelly's that attack the the slow movers as they walk down the road,&nbsp; <br />these skellys are easy to kill with holy nova,&nbsp; wait till they swarm you and let it rip.&nbsp; if u have anything else like dinamite,&nbsp; or oil of imolation,&nbsp; use it to save your mana,&nbsp; thorns buff is very handy to have,&nbsp; try and mana up again.<br /><br />the next waves are tough,&nbsp; if you have low mana it will be even tougher,&nbsp; dont give up if a few die,&nbsp; it will happen,&nbsp; dont give up either,&nbsp; took me alot of goes,&nbsp; but the reward is great.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just completed the quest for the epic staff Benediction. I used a total of 7 oil of immolations, and 2 major mana potions. I had a paladin guildmate help me out by standing on the side line during the quest. A group of skeletons aggroed onto him during the first wave of peasants and he healed himself for a while before collapsing, saving me a huge amount of mana. Overall the quest probably took about 10 minutes and the spells I used were Rank 4 Renew, Rank 3 Flash Heal, Abolish Disease, and Holy Nova Rank 3.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have my 60 priest and this staff is FULLY OWNEAGE if any1 needs a run through im on spinebreaker and my name is&nbsp; Curi&nbsp; &nbsp; so add me<br /><br />catch ya later tatata</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This thing has a really cool cast..... it's like a resurection.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where would you get the start for this quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><a href="/classic/item=18608/benediction">Benediction</a> is Benediction. It also turns into Anathema. My guess is you can pick one or the other if you're holy specced or shadow specced. Probably the priest's best friend at 60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You can get this item before you got eye of divinity! i tried to do this q with the Trinket you get from the Quest in scholo.. (that makes you see ghost outside scholo)<br /><br />and yes you see the quest giver.. and you can do the quest.. so i have eye of shadow, Splinter of Nordrassil.... but not yet eye of divinity. :) did this 22feb 2006.. dont think anyone else have been thinking of this=P<br /><br />but.. the only boost you get.. is that when you get the eye in mc, you can but them all together at once. And thats kinda sweet according to me:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Comes from the The balance of light and shadow quest, it's the reward. Oh, that quest is a priest only one I believe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Splinter of Nordrassil is a quest reward from the quest 'A Warning' which is given by a NCP in Eeastern Plaguelands west of Stratholme. Though you can only see the NPC if you have the Eye of Divinity equipped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where is this from? :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I also did the quest with the Spectral Essence 2 months ago. It worked like a charm!<br />Holy Nova ftw!</div>

    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
