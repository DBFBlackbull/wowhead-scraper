<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The artisan first aid quest is located in Theramore island, (boat from menethil). You get a quest where you are supposed to heal 15 guys and something like that. If accomplished you will gain the artisan first aid skill.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In the <b>Stromgarde Castle</b> in <b>Arathi Highlands</b> there is a vendor hidden on the west side of the castle that sells you the book for <b>first aid - 150</b>, plus how to make <b>silk</b>, and <b>heavy silk bandages</b>.<br /><br />To find him, the <b>easiest way</b> is to look for a <b>crack in the castle wall to the west</b>, nearest the road.(Keep in mind there's a bunch of 30's in the castle if you try going in through main entrance.) Go in the crack, and there's a bunch of Alliance NPC's roaming around. To the <b>east</b> you'll see a <b>bridge</b>- cross it. You'll be in a courtyard facing a building with the Prince inside. <b>Turn right, and you'll see the vendor hidden against the wall there</b>. Look carefully because the green vines kinda hide him. <br /><br />I had to find out the hard way how to get in there through all the level 37's but if I would have seen that crack on the way in, as I did on the way out, I would have saved myself 2 deaths!<br /><br />Good Luck! ^_^<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br />----&gt; updated - yes sorry I had the East &amp; West reversed the first time I wrote this..

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just in case anyone else is confused, I can verify that you can be level 15 and use this book to train to a skill of 225 First Aid (of course you need 125 to use the book).<br /><br />So, no level requirement for this book, just the stated skill proficiency.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Horde First Aid book- learn at lvl 10+ get from dustwallow marsh/brakenwall village.<br /><br />Alliance First aid book- stormgaurd find the friendlys go over the bridge he is to your right.<br /><br />Both of these are books to learn 150+ First Aid. trainable at 125 skill lvl.<br /><br />All Artisan professions (225+) require that you either be lvl 40 and have ~210~ in that profession ===+++=== OR ===+++=== be lvl 35 and have 225 lvl in the profession. First aid is one of those proffesions which is easy to have at 225 by lvl 35 and to get artisan lvl FA you must complete a quest which follows..<br /><br />Alliance- go to theramore (take the boat from menethil) and go into the barracks (the building with all the gaurds training in front of it) and on the first floor there is a Dr gustav and he will give you the quest if you meet the req's (see above). Basically you stand in the center of the room and bandage the soldiers around you in order of most sevearly injured first. It may take a couple tries but its not that difficult.<br /><br />Horde- go to HAMMERFALL in arathi highlands. there is a trauma surgeon there which will give you a quest to save the soldiers much like the alliance version above as long as you meet the reqs (see the above section).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found that crack in the wall on the NW side really useful<br /><br />I couldn't find the person (I thought it was a lady) and I got cocky and ventured too far and got pwned by invisible dudes. When I came back as a spirit, I went through the front door and did the &quot;3 right turns&quot;. Keep going over the bridge, into the garden area. He's kind of in the corner of the garden, over the bridge. I could only buy the expert first aid book, you need higher skill to buy the 2 'recipes' or whatever. I had a maxed out 150 coming in here.<br /><br />BTW on the path through Arathi I stopped at Refuge Point, and theres a handy Gryphon Master there.

There is a road system, but you still may aggro a 36 raptor or something. If you dont want to pay someone in the AH, maybe get a swift run potion (you should have these anyway) and try your luck. When youre in Stomgarde, keep right and right again and you will walk over a bridge and youll be there soon at the NPC selling it. In the stormgarde area 36+ elites can be found, but they should be far away. If you aggro them use your potion and run over the bridge.<br /><br />Imo its a price or attitude thing. Its not that you absolutely need the 150+ first aid skill at low level (pots are really much much better), but if its your first char, Id recommend to wait until 30+. Then you can get the Southshore flightpoint too, which gives you access to 30+ quests and also Scarlet Monastry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>whitevvolf</b></h3>With the addition of <b>Season of Discovery</b>, as a Horde member I did not see this item being sold by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=13476/balai-lokwein">Balai Lok'Wein</a> at Brackenwall Village in <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=15/dustwallow-marsh">Dustwallow Marsh</a>. I haven't seen anyone mention it yet, but perhaps it has been removed for the time being.<br /><br />Please reply if you can confirm this item being sold in Season of Discovery. Thanks!<br /><br />~Bluetigress</div>
