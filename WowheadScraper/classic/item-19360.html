Even a priest with Benediction can upgrade on this mace.  I currently have Benediction which has 31 intel, +106 to healing.  Now, consider this.  If you trade in the staff on this mace you now have 18 intel \/ 84 healing.  Put this with the Fire runed Grimoire from Molten core and you have another 21 intel \/ 11 damage and healing. \r\n\r\nWith this setup you now have 39 intel and 95 damage \/ healing effects on your weapon set.  This shows an improvement of 8 intel = 120 more mana, and provides more versitility since the effect is now applied to damage as well as healing. \r\n\r\nThat said, A palidin could use it equaly well.  Though most of our paladins have Aurastone, or Jin'do's hexar already.  Bottomline, this is not MC gear...  It's the best in BWL gear.  Anyone using a caster weapon like this from MC can upgrade to this item.  I myself would like to see this prioritized for Druids \/ pally (I'm on the alliance so insert shamen where I say pally)since priests have other options.  Namely Benediction, but I'm content to let others upgrade to catch up to me, rather than take another stride ahead of a fellow guild member. \r\n\r\nAnother great item, very similar to this one, is the claw of chromaggus.  This is a dagger version of the same, offering only 1 less intel and 64 to damage \/ effects.(I think, too lazy to be exact or check : P)  What people have to think about here is this:\r\n\r\nWithin the instance are very similar weapons for nearly every type of mana user.  Be they mage \/ warlock \/ priest \/ shamen ~ pally.  In the interest of progress as a guild, which you will have if you ever see this drop btw, you should try to assigin the weapons.  This because while priests and pally can use maces, priests can also use daggers.  Try to keep yourself open to alternatives.

My reg smite hits for 750 and mind blast for 725. I was dueling a warrior and poped my trinket to smite him and did 1588 dmg on a smite crit. The warrior almost cried. \n\nBest of all? Smite dmg can't be partially resisted. Nor can a player build up holy resists. They have the 4% base chance to ressist all spells have. \n\nRight now I'm running in PvP with: \n\n+431 healing then add in improved renew and SH talents = INSANE renew ticks. 2K healed with trinket poped. \n\n+282 Damage to ALL spells = GG, 1200 dmg pain, 1150 dmg Starshards, 750 smite, 725 MB. Add 200-280 with trinket poped. \n\nNow, when I pop my ZHC trinket, I just addded 280 dmg and 560 healing. Every 2 min, for 20 seconds. Since Dots don't lower the healing or damage of the tinnket. \n\n\nThis picture was before I got the choker of the fire lord on sunday. And without my trinket poped. My items are in my sig in my allakhazam profile. \n\nhttp:\/\/i4.photobucket.com\/albums\/y120\/Gmankuza\/crits.jpg","date":"2006-01-24T21:18:50-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"If you're rolling on a Nefarian drop just for pvp... you're an idiot.","creationdate":"2006-02-07T14:25:04-06:00","id":1283391,"rating":-6,"commentid":3075421,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Nowlan","importedSubject":"RE: Best Priest PvP weapon"},{"body":"Not necessarily.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>greengoo</b></h3>One of the nicer weapons in the game, it applies equal boost to Paladins (Shaman), Priests, and Druids. Normally, the Priest and Druids have better options in the form of staves, but some really excellent 1H/OH combo's do exist. What you're looking at is a great healing weapon, granted, but the Paladins and Priests are almost always looking at the +damage. For either, this is a terrific PvP weapon. This weapon is honestly only eclipsed by &quot;The End of Dreams&quot;, a weapon that is basically a powered up version of Lok that drops from Grobbulus in Naxxaramas.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5326</b></h3>For a raiding Paladin (mostly healing and buffing/cleansing) do you think +55 healing, +30 spell damage, or +22 intellect is the better enchant for this weapon?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4175</b></h3>22 int enchant is really a waste of money unless you have a very shallow mana pool. It's only 330 mana (363 for Discipline priests) This is barely enough for a maximum rank flash heal. +55 healing benefits the whole fight and enables you to down rank heals (at least until the expansion where they are changing it) for maximum healing/mana efficiency.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>netherbane</b></h3>What many people fail to realize here... Even a priest with Benediction can upgrade on this mace. I currently have Benediction which has 31 intel, +106 to healing. Now, consider this. If you trade in the staff on this mace you now have 18 intel / 84 healing. Put this with the Fire runed Grimoire from Molten core and you have another 21 intel / 11 damage and healing. <br /><br />With this setup you now have 39 intel and 95 damage / healing effects on your weapon set. This shows an improvement of 8 intel = 120 more mana, and provides more versitility since the effect is now applied to damage as well as healing. <br /><br />That said, A palidin could use it equaly well. Though most of our paladins have Aurastone, or Jin'do's hexar already. Bottomline, this is not MC gear... It's the best in BWL gear. Anyone using a caster weapon like this from MC can upgrade to this item. I myself would like to see this prioritized for Druids / pally (I'm on the alliance so insert shamen where I say pally)since priests have other options. Namely Benediction, but I'm content to let others upgrade to catch up to me, rather than take another stride ahead of a fellow guild member. <br /><br />Another great item, very similar to this one, is the claw of chromaggus. This is a dagger version of the same, offering only 1 less intel and 64 to damage / effects.(I think, too lazy to be exact or check : P) What people have to think about here is this:<br /><br />Within the instance are very similar weapons for nearly every type of mana user. Be they mage / warlock / priest / shamen ~ pally. In the interest of progress as a guild, which you will have if you ever see this drop btw, you should try to assigin the weapons. This because while priests and pally can use maces, priests can also use daggers. Try to keep yourself open to alternatives. Great staff off Nefarian too @.@ You could argue, i did, that it's not really an upgrade for a priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9431</b></h3>In reply to Rinkotsu: +22 Int would be a waste of money. If you're a paladin, and you're doing Nefarion, you aren't running out of mana in a fight. If you want spell crit, get items with spell crit, but bigger and more consistent heals are more important in End Game instances than mana/crit heals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thebrassthief</b></h3>This is an awesome 1H Mace that drops off of Nef in BWL, as stated above. This is a great mace for Paladins, Shamans, and Druids. Priests by this point have their epic staff so this should not be something to completely set their sights on unless they are Discipline/Holy DAMAGE spec, then it is a great asset.<br /><br />I believe in the theory of making the rich richer. What is this Mace rich with? Spell damage. I would put +33 Spell Damage on this asap if I was a Druid or Priest. Shaman or Paladin I would consider putting on +22 Int, my own mana depending.</div>

(Most of our damage is now from +dmg on weapons now in 1.9 as well)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For 95% of the endgame pve material in the game atm, this is the best mainhand available for a Shaman in the only viable pve role a shaman has, which is healing.<br />This + malistar's defender makes a combo which leaves any other item combo available (for hands that is) for any class behind, when we're talking about healing.<br />Our guild includes priests, druids and shamans on this weapon when reading dkp.<br />I've got it and love it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Priests/druids/shamans/pallies.<br /><br />either one of those cases should use this mace and if they want to spend their DKP on it they should, it is that simple.<br /><br />Oh, and for the noob at the top of this thread, who said this is a caster weapon and anyone can use it...last time i checked mages and warlocks couldn't use maces only swords, so keep dreaming.</div>

I'm sure others are... and when your guild is able to farm nef usually it doesn't matter what your spec is unless your the main tank (even then you can still have MS).<br /><br />Most guilds take pride in the fact that they use shadow priests and feral druids (the ones that are past MC anyway) as a friend said &quot;it's like showing everyone else how bad ass you&quot;<br /><br />Only thing that sucks is that I have to confer with the mage/warlock union instead of the priest union.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In fact the 84 dmg is why it is valuable. You can use the 84 spell power when you are not in the raid instance.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, we get Benediction/Anathema.... So we're not allowed to have a new weapon after killng the final boss in bwl because we got one from a the second last one in mc, who in comparison is a complete pushover? That point is nothing but greedy healers wanting to push out some competetion. This mace has would fit a holy priest nicely, especially when he's grinding.<br /><br />Yes, we actually have to solo stuff at times. However mind boggling crazy it may sound, the other classes are NOT standing in line to help out when we need to grind in our +900 healing gear-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you should get +30 spell dmg over +55 healing. the +30 spell dmg also affects healing, so you lose -25 healing but get +30 dmg. nice weapon :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can you stop that silly arguing. It's for priest, pally/shaman or druid. Anyone can bid on it. It's not a healing mace, its a dmg mace and very nice for that. Finally a dmg&amp;heal; weapon that mages and locks can't use so it's up for grabs for us.<br /><br />You could argue that paladins deserver this as they can't use staves, but it's kinda waste to use dmg&amp;heal; item for healing only. If a pally wants to do dps, he will gor for a real 2h dps weapon anyway. We had 2 of these drop, both were won by paladins. Not because others would not have been allowed to bid, but the prices were so insane that priests wouldn't bid so much on secondary gear.<br /><br />This is golden for holy priests who can't use anathema for damage making. Mind blast has 8sec cooldown without talents and you have no mind flay. The only other shadow damage spell you have is the dot. +Shadow damage on items is next to useless for a holy priest. You want +dmg&amp;heal; instead. I have about 400dmg&amp;heal;, that doubles my dps, makes me a really dangerous opponent in PVP with 1,7k smite crits and stuff and I can outdamage most people on 5-10man runs. Sometimes even when doing all the healing too, as long as I get time to drink back mana.<br /><br />The dps on this is insane! Waste to use it for healing only imo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Very nice for healing, but the funny thing is, and this is what most have ignored, since some time ago +30 spelldamage to weapons becamed spelldamage &amp; healing.<br /><br />Add spelldamage up on this you get 114 spelldamage on one handed mace, wich is by FAR best option for oomkins / shadowpriests, and having allso +114 healing (Instead +139 healing) incase they need to heal. And I fail to see 25 healing will be saving anyones life. At this point you should have enough healing stacked up anyway.<br /><br />Let alone offhand wich you can get from as simple place than AV for 33. meaning total of 147 spelldamage from offhand &amp; mainhand combo, without stepping on anyones toes, really. Allso you can swap this to offhand giving you total of 167 spelldamage &amp; some odd 3/5 manarege, just by having this &amp; exalted @ av rewards on your disposal. <br /><br />Anyone tought about BC with this? If you think it to end, this is probably highest plus damage mainhand for a while, having it will be nice once you have to xp again, wouldnt you agree?<br /><br />Oh and dont say they get anathema, you've seen new holy talents.

Druids and priests might have greater use for it, but hell, what healerclass doesn't have a greater use than a Paladin and still they have to do their job.<br /><br />Thinking again, I'd say: Whoever has the most dkp of all Healers will get it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am just looking for opinions on whether certain pallies should get preference on this item over others. It was my opinion that a hybrid pally would be well suited with this item, but I am not quite sure. Before the recent patch, I was spec'd at 13/23/15, making me mostly protection, but in raids I cover the spots of a lower end holy or retribution pally. I assumed this mace would make up for what I was lacking in the other 2 talent trees to an extent. And with the new patch, even more so with a spellpower enchant placed on it. My previous item was Herald of Woe, but I had no decent 1-hander to allow me to use a shield so I decided to bid on it. With the highest dkp, of course I won on that count. However, a few people were displeased and motioned that it should go to a holy paladin. Looking at the stats, I would feel that if this item did go to a holy paladin, the +84 to damage spells and effects would almost be a complete waste. Any comments or opinions are welcome.....

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Priests who are in guilds that can kill nefarion, all have benediction, your guild probably owns kazzak every time he pops with 15 people and only let other guilds get him when all your priests have their eyes of shadow. Benediction = this main hand + very good off-hand. So, coming form a priest, good luck druids/pallies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>best weapon in game for paladin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's good for any caster that can weld maces, obviously.<br /><br />Personally I prefer that &quot;melee hitting&quot; caster weapons go to Shammies and Pallies first but really, plenty of people will have a different weapon of choice. You'd be amazed at the number of pallies that didn't want Finkles.<br /><br />Not all Pallies/Shammies go with 1h+shield, some will prefer a 2h mace, some a staff, some a sword, no need to &amp;*!@# about it.<br /><br />Odds are that for any weapon there's 2-8 people in your raid wanting that one, even if there's 10-25 people that &quot;can use it&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon is Godly for a good PvP/PvE priest. Benadiction is just a huge target over your head that says, &quot;Hey look, I'm a healer, kill me first please&quot;. SO by all means, force your guild priests to be stuck never goign to BG to heal because you're forcing them to stick with that crappy staff. Or, they will run around in shadow form becuase their PvP side of the staff does nothing for smite, and thier damage with pain will suck. The good priests know shadow form is for Solo PvP, so for a ggroup healer in PvP that wan't to also own face, Then they go for a force of will smite hitting healer spec.<br /> My mind blast and smite crits are at about 1050 right now and I crit almost every second attack. My reg smite hits for 750 and mind blast for 725. I was dueling a warrior and poped my trinket to smite him and did 1588 dmg on a smite crit. The warrior almost cried. <br /><br />Best of all? Smite dmg can't be partially resisted. Nor can a player build up holy resists. They have the 4% base chance to ressist all spells have. <br /><br />Right now I'm running in PvP with: <br /><br />+431 healing then add in improved renew and SH talents = INSANE renew ticks. 2K healed with trinket poped. <br /><br />+282 Damage to ALL spells = GG, 1200 dmg pain, 1150 dmg Starshards, 750 smite, 725 MB. Add 200-280 with trinket poped. <br /><br />Now, when I pop my ZHC trinket, I just addded 280 dmg and 560 healing. Every 2 min, for 20 seconds. Since Dots don't lower the healing or damage of the tinnket. <br /><br />This picture was before I got the choker of the fire lord on sunday. And without my trinket poped. My items are in my sig in my allakhazam profile. <br /><br /><a href="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y120/Gmankuza/crits.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y120/Gmankuza/crits.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Please stop comparing totally irrelevant drops between each other. Ahn Qiraj drops have nothing to do with BWL and vice versa. A guild that might be trying to finish BWL will probably have AQ as a future target, not actively raid it. And someone compared a simple, standalone drop with a weapon that requires a quest item from AQ and 3 Elementium bars? Are you at all serious?<br /><br />This is very simple: Mace grants +lots of healing/damage. Therefore it's intended for any class that can use maces and heals/causes spell damage.</div>

There are MUCH better combo's out there but there are too many retards that think it's not for priests.<br /><br />On top of that, the dps is only 41 for a nef epic -- how the hell could a pally, shaman, or druid use that to full extent?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm pretty sure shamans can use the Augur staff as much as anyone else with staff proficiency, and they benifit a lot from the regen. Just because a shaman CAN use a shield doesn't mean they have to have Lok'amir and say Malistar's. In a fight where the shaman doesn't really take physical damage they can drop the shield for a 2h weapon without losing anything really. I'm not sure whether this applies to paladins as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Some people seem to be misunderstanding that this weapon does +84 to all healing AND damage done by magical effects. Even though it has relatively low damage, the stats are great for shamans (especially elem and resto specced ones). The +spell effect means that earthshock would do near around 600 regularely, instead of 510-520. Nevertheless, i'd think the mace could be rolled for by any of those four classes (pally, druid, shaman priest)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Let's see witch caster clases can use a 1h mace.<br />Druid,priest,paladin,shaman.<br /><br />What is the purpose of these classes?<br />Druid:Hybrid, Primary Healer (he heals or does mostly melee damage)<br />Priest:Primary Healer (can do shadow damage)<br />paladin:Hybrid, Secondary Healer (don't really know this class so won't defend it :D ) <br />shaman:Hybrid, Secondary Healer (Can heal, spelldamage and melee)<br /><br />Oke let's have a look at the mace:<br />Binds when picked up <br />Unique <br />Main Hand Mace <br />47 - 127 Damage Speed 2.10 <br />(41.4 damage per second) <br />+18 Intellect <br />+8 Spirit <br />+10 Stamina <br />Requires Level 60 <br />Passive: Increases <b>damage</b> and <b>healing</b> done by magical spells and effects by up to 84.<br /><br />WOT the mace also does + spell damage!<br />Witch class mostly uses spelldamage and healing?<br />O yes thats shaman.<br />Priest is second since he is primary healer and can also do spell damage. (I would like to see a shadowpriest in BWL, that would be funny XD)<br />And last is the druid since he doesn't really do mutch spell damage if he wants to do damage he wil go feral and cath.<br /><br />Order of prefrence:<br />1.Shaman<br />2.Priest<br />3.Druid<br /><br />And some of you might not agree with this or think this is true, but this is the order guilds wil give out the item to the raid. <br />If you think otherwise, then all i can say how far did your guild progress in BWL? <br /><br />(and before i hear more about the low dps it has witch isnb't good for shaman.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>are u kidding this is such a shammy drop compare to the <br />hammer of the gathering storm<br />62-137damage speed 2.40<br />(41.5 damage per second)<br />+7 strength<br />+10 stamina<br />+9 intellect<br />classes:<b>SHAMAN</b><br />Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 53.<br /><br />set bonus: Increases the chain target damage multiplier of your Chain Lightning spell by 5%.<br /><br />now compare that weapon which is for shamans to <br /><br />Lok'amir il Romathis<br />Binds when picked up<br />Unique<br />Main Hand	Mace<br />47 - 127 Damage	Speed 2.10<br />(41.4 damage per second)<br />+18 Intellect<br />+8 Spirit<br />+10 Stamina<br />Requires Level 60<br />Passive: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 84. <br /><br />i would say that this is a shaman weapon because of the fact that it is so versatile, because you can be a elementally spec'ed shaman with the high increase in spell dam and the intellelect, or u can be a enhancement shaman with the stamina and the fast attack rate of the weapon (also shamans who use windfury want to use faster weapons like 1h axes/maces or daggers cause there is a noticable increase in windfury proc'ing compared to 2h weapons like a <b>STAFF</b>. for those who dont believe me go and compare, i have seen a mace proc with windfury maybe 7 times in one fight while staff's have proc'ed MAYBE once in a fight.), and because of the increase in healing resto shamans can take advatage of this a lot.<br /><br />so can any give me a reason why this is a such a great priest weapon? or why he needs the stamina so much? it sounds more like a few priests settled for this item rather than going for weapons that they can take more advantage of and then they tried convincing themselves that it was a great priest weapon.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Apr 5 18:42:05 2006</div>
