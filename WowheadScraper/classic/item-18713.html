Go to Molten Core, and defeat Majordomo Executus. He has a 50% chance of dropping this item, and this item or the Eye of Divinity will ALWAYS drop.\n2. Go to Onyxia's Lair and kill her, she can drop the Mature Black Dragon sinew, a necessity for the quest.\n3. Travel to the lands of Felwood, and Irontree Grove. Speak to the ancients on the hill and obtain their quest.\n4. The demons are listed in no particular order.\n  I. Winterspring - Artorius the Doombringer.\n\n1. Buffs - Intellect Buff is nice\n2. Potions - Health\/Mana and a potion for removing a magic debuff.\n3. Group - At least 1 other to run in front of you and train the mobs.\n4. Go to near Wintersaber Rock in Winterspring and look for a Tauren named Artorius the Amiable. Approach him when you are ready to begin the fight.\n5. Begin Kiting Artorius towards Everlook, Serpent Sting is his weakness and so, run and use Rank 1 Arcane shot to keep him tapped and use highest rank Serpent Sting to bring him down. WATCH OUT FOR HIS DEMON DEBUFF.\n\n  II. Burning Steppes - Klinfran the Crazed.\n1. Buffs - Mark of the Wild, Intellect\n2. Potions - Health\/Mana\n3. Group - Not required\n4. Approach Franklin the Friendly south of Blackrock Mountain to begin the fight.\n5. The fight starts and he will periodically enrage.  If he hits you while enraged, he can do upwards of 2000 damage.  The Solution: Scorpid Sting.  It unenrages him and makes him hit you for a measly 1 damage. Run in and melee for 2-3 hits, wing clip rank 1, and run out, he will enrage. Rinse and repeat.\n\n  III. Un'Goro Crater - Simone the Seductress.\n1. Buffs - Fortitude, Mark of the Wild, Intellect\n2. Potions - Health\/Mana, Greater Nature Protection.\n3. Group - Not required.\n4. Approach Simone the Inconspicuous and her pet, Precious, wandering around the Hot Springs of Un'Goro.\n5. As soon as the fight starts, run in and Freeze Trap her pet Precious. Proceed to Viper Sting her, it is her weakness, it will Silence her.  Run in and melee until she begins casting. At this point run out and Viper Sting again, her lightning bolt HURTS.  If you don't make it away in time, the Nature Protection Potion will help. Keep Precious Freeze Trapped until the fight is over, then you can kill him separately.\n\n  IV. Silithus - Solenor the Slayer.\n1. Buffs - Everything you can get.\n2. Potions - Health\/Mana AT LEAST 2 GREATER SHADOW PROTECTION\n3. Group - WARLOCK\n4. Approach Nelson the Nice as he wanders around Southern Silithus.\n5. BEFORE THE FIGHT: Duel the Warlock and have them Curse of Recklessness you. DO NOT END THIS DUEL. Have the lock keep using the curse every time it wears off.\n6. Begin the fight and run in and Wing Clip Rank 3.  It will immobilize him. Run out and shoot him,  but keep moving in circles so his Creeping Doom Bugs don't touch you. They deal 150+ damage if they touch you.  Every time he is un-immobilized run in and Wing Clip again. Repeat this tactic and keep using shadow protection potions.\n\n5. Return to Felwood to obtain your reward.\n\nOPTIONAL - Collect a Mature Blue Dragon Sinew (Azuregos or Elites in Winterspring) and bring it for an 18 slot quiver.\n*NOTE* It is possible to group with another hunter, spawn the demon, and have them kill it for you.

So if say you begin with an aimedshot, follow it up with autoshot, follow the autoshot up with a multishot, after the autoshot follwoing the multishot, you would wait for you next autoshot to finish shooting rather then instantly start casting Aimed Shot again.\n\nHow to Know Which Shot Rotation to use.\nFor Rhok'Delar you would want to use a Clipped rotation since the High End Damage isnt very high, your autoshot would not be doing as much damage as say, Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting.\nWith the Xbow of Smiting you would want to run a Full rotation as the Autoshot does a significant Amount of damage.\n SERPENT STING IS A WASTE OF MANA\nPreserve your mana for Aimedshot and Multishot,  serpent sting does not output enough damage to justify the mana they use, so try to always use aimedshot and multishot. Only really usable when the extra DoTs are needed.\n\nConsumables are an amazing way to maintain your DPS.\n\nBuying Consumables such as Nightfin Soup, Lesser Mana Oil and Mageblood potions will increase your DPS by ALOT because of the mana regen, you might not think it but a hunter with alot of +mana per\/5 is a hunter that is outputting alot of DPS.\nTry getting your ZG Bracers and getting the +4 mana per\/5 Enchant on them, also try to get your ZG Shoulders.\n\nAlso bringing Major Mana Potions increases your dps alot, you shouldnt have to worry about it messing up ur Major Healing cooldown because well, your a hunter, your have feign death, use it and you wont need to use healing pots.\n\nAlso a good way to increase your DPS by ALOT is by using a Flask of Distilled Wisdom.\nI wouldnt reccomend using it unless we are trying really hard to bypass a milestone in AQ40, as it would increase your dps by ALOT.\n\nIm pretty sure this is right, start using a shot rotation in raids and you WILL notice your dps increase.\n\nAlso if you pick up a Wolf Pup from LBRS, they have an AOE shout taht increases your next attacks attack power by 30, using it over and over in a raid will also increase your dps alot.","date":"2006-12-10T22:03:42-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":9,"id":2707305,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"In reply for *where do u get the Quest*\nThe Quest starts from when u get the leaf drop from MC after killing Major Dommo \n\nHope this helps :)","date":"2006-07-20T00:36:49-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"wolvereen","importedSubject":"Hunter Quest"},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":2707319,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"i've just killed klinfran the crazed and i wanted to thank you for giving us this cool guide. im now on the way for simone the seductress\n\nat the end you have made some mistakes\n1.: the despawn of the demons is now 30 minutes because recent patch have modified the despawn time of these demons\n2.:after you kill the demons and turn in the quests you gain an ancient rune etched stave wich is not a weapon just an item.

get the leaf from majordomo(50%drop rate,other drop is eye for priest bene quest),u get mature black dragon sinew from onyxia and i dont know if all guild do this but if u have 1 u get the other by default.\n\nFirst of,u should head to winterspring and take this demon first,all u have to do is kite him for a few mins,catch him on the south west part of his patrol so u can kite him striat to the road and along the road,serpent sting and aimed shot rank 1 is all u will need for this,stay at about 31-41 yard range(if u get under 30 he will turn u in 2 a demon and u die)...my advice download itemrack(feign and take ur geer of 2 avoid armor bills),also take a restorative potion if u haveing trouble\n\nNext up 2 burning streppes,this 1 i found really easy,have a mate kill all ads around u when u fighting.The way u kill this 1 is meelee\/ranged,wat u do is auto shot to start him of,range for a few seconds ,wingclip and run to ranged distance,wait for him to enrage then scorpid sting him (witch will disenrage him) and auto shot a few time,then rinse and repeat. bring a mana pot\/health pot incase u get low ...save all ur mana for wingcliping\/scorpid sting\n\nNext 1 is ungoro crater,this 1 is very very easy,if ur a engineer is even easier,wat u do is lay a freezing trap,trap the pet and meelee the demon for the whole fight,when the pet comes out its handy if u have a rocket helm but its not neccesary,Bring a health stone and major health potion and a nature resist potion,get a stam buff,,motw,also its helpfull 2 have a hunter in the group with u to have aspect of the wild on and be feigned neer u so u get the buff and u have aspect of the monkey on\n\nLast 1 is in silithus,this 1 is tricky but not if u know wat u doing,easy mode for this is take 3 major shadow protection potions,and a warlock,take the potion wait 2 mins then enter a duel with a warlock,get him 2 put COR on u so u immune 2 fear,now enter the battle lay a frost trap pull him on to it then feign,this will disenrage him for the fight,now lay a explosive trap drink 2 full mana and open with a aimed shot when he gets 2 u wing clip him witch will imobilise him for 30 seconds (do this the whole fight every time he gets close 2 u),run around to ur left or right,shoot again ,run around more,shoot again ,this is to keep his spawns chasing u not hiting u,multi shot when u can to help kill the spawns and when there are alot of them volley them and kil them,thats pretty much that.to do this without a warlock is a little harder but not 2 hard...also get a health stone and stam buff. \n\nGOOD LUCK fellow hunters and also GO 2 >>www.tkasomething.com<< go 2 the hunter section and u will find a full run down on the strats,demon weeknesses,videos ,screenshots

I had a nightmare killing the burning steppes demon, since I had ~ZG level equipment that time.. a nightmare really.. I completed the hunter epic quest the night before BC arrived, but I don't think that it worths the effort if you have BC. But it was a good, a very good challange.

It was like: 'Man... I worked so hard for this bow, spent an assload of money on potions, a lot of time to get the sinew, the petrified leaf, DKP, whatever. Done the demons all alone, died many times, started over, paid for the potions, the repair bills again, I invested much effort in this bow..

Also dual wielded with Demonslaying on both and use Aspect of the Monkey. [\/small] \n\n[b]Burning Steppes[\/b] - Activate him in the NW corner near that Altar. Kite him up top and just scorpid, run in and melee for roughly 5 seconds, wing clip and get away. Whenever he frenzies just wait a second, scorpid and repeat. \n\n[small][i]note:[\/i] Didn't use any potions. Just used Aspect of the Monkey and dual wielded demonslaying enchants. This is all about timing. [\/small]\n\n[b]Silithus[\/b] - Wing clips immobilize him. Put Rank 1 arcane shot on your action bar. When he fears its a ~600dmg DD and if you don't keep hitting him he'll deagro. After fear wears off quick arcane rnk1 and just avoid the bugs. You CAN use volley on them but I think it's easier to run around him in a circle and just shoot him, they are slow enough.\n\n[small][i]note:[\/i] Greater Shadow Protection x1 (2 in some cases when the fight lasts a bit), and Major Rejuvenation x1.[\/small]\n\n[b]Winterspring[\/b] - My favorite. Actually had to kill this one 3 times for a few of my guildmates. (This was post 1.6, and as long as you have the quest and are partied you can kill them for other hunters.) It's all about the strafe keys (Q,E). Activate him in the southern most part of his path. Theres a cut through the mountains that lead to the road. Rank 1 arcane, Aspect of the Cheetah, and Serpent is all you need. Just start with serpent, and run, just hit him with a jump shot Rank 1 arcane as soon as it refreshes to keep him agroed. (Jump shot is just jump and when you're in the air shoot, lol.) Reapply serpent as soon as it fades and just get him to the road. Kite him all the way down to Everlook and he should be dead before you actually get to the town if serpent was applied as soon as possible.\n\n[small][i]note:[\/i] The only thing here is to have people clear the mobs out of the area for you, at least up to the road.

But that's the easy part.\n\nNext you have to kill 4 level 60-61 demons in Winterspring, Un-Goro, Silithus, and Blasted Lands. But you must Solo the demons, if a Horde or Alliance player so much as sneezes on him, it goes home to cry to it's mommy.\n\nNo biggie, grab a healer and bring that bastard on. But what's that? If you're healed or buffed during the fight, the demon gives you the finger and dissapears.\n\nThat's painful, but they're 60 or 61 elites right? That turtle or bear never did wrong, unless...no how could they...yep. Your pet so much as touches them the demon will also dissapear.\n\nSo it's down to this. No assistance, no buffs, no heals, no pets. You alone against the demon in a massive kitefest of doom. And if a horde player comes around to poke the demon, you're screwed and have to start the fight all over again.\n\nHowever, you will be able to get buffs before the fight. So you'll need healthstones potions, marks, forts, DM buffs, felwood buffs and Blast land buffs. \n\nGoodluck to all you aspiring hunters.

I don't consider this the best bow due to stats, because clearly it's not. Rather it's the most epic bow due to the series of quests you had to complete to obtain the bow.\r\n\r\nThe quests require a hunter to go solo against four elite demons. A single buff, heal, point of damage or etc. from another player was enough to reset the encounter. Basically anything that put another player on the demon's aggro table reset the encounter. These quests were custom created so that you and only you could defeat the demons. So if you have this bow it meant you learned how to play... There wasn't much you could do to get around this shy of having someone else play our account.\r\n\r\nThus I consider this the closest thing in the game to graduating from college for a hunter. On a guild application the Rhock indicated this players can kite, dps hard, manage aggro, and etc. I can't think of a single piece of hunter gear that indicates as much about a hunter's skill than the Rhok.\r\n\r\nDon't confuse what I'm saying here, it isn't the best bow DPS and stats wise, but rather the best bow for proving one's merit as a epic hunter.\r\n\r\n(reposted from the \"Live\" version)","date":"2019-06-10T14:09:26-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":132,"id":3152081,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"PalarishaMalf","body":"With classic coming out, and me still transmog'ing my ranged weapon to the trusty Rhok, I was reading the comments section here and thought I'd post a few thoughts, for those of us that got the rhok and lok back in the day, and for those people that really didn't know anything about it and now find out it's the BiS, since it hasn't been available in a really long time, and a good portion of the fanbase wasn't even born when it was.\n- If you were in a guild that raided MC and Onyxia regularly, even if there were 10 other hunters, you eventually got the leaf for yourself.  But if you were like me, 5 priest drops happened first, then the one week you couldn't make the raid, it dropped, and it didn't drop again for you for another couple weeks.  But the wait was worth it.\n- Most hunters had crappy weapons when they got the rhok and lok, so it was a huge upgrade.  MC bosses didn't drop a lot of gear on each boss in general, and mean\/ignorant guild leadership didn't always give the few other ranged weapons to hunters, so it was rare to get anything until the leaf, which only hunters could get.  I know it sounds absurd, but if you lived getting passed up by a rogue with a bajillion DKP, you know the pain.  Myself, when I got it I had a blue bow from one of the 50+ dungeons (because Mag NEVER dropped his bow) and one of those level 57 green axes that looks like a ninja star on a toothpick (but it was all agility so kinda OP for a green).  But you went from a ilvl ~60 bow with ~30 dps to ilvl 75 (which was what the stuff in BWL was) with almost 44 dps.  It was a big deal.  And the model is still so cool.  Shiny metal with vines and wood, and little flowers that constantly bud.  Still think it's the best looking bow Bliz ever made.\n- One of the best things about the rhok was the shot speed, at 2.9.  Until like WotLK I think, the hunter auto shot timer reset anytime you used an ability, whereas right now it just goes off regularly at whatever rate it's set to.  So hunters had to learn to use their abilities in between that shot timer, called it shot weaving.  Most bow speeds were mid to high 2s, most guns were faster, and most crossbows were way slower.  But you wanted the speed just long enough so you could weave in your aimed shot, which was a 3 second cast.  But with raid buffs and whatnot, it was usually 2.8.  So with lag accounted for, the Rhok was perfect at 2.9.  Blizzard really thought out weapons back then.  But that shot speed had a HUGE impact on hunter DPS.  The bow off Mag and the gun off Golemag in MC were both too fast.  So you could use it, but you'd constantly be extending your shot timers.  Even when BWL came out, the Heartstriker bow was too fast, the crossbow off Chrome was too slow, and if you ever had a dragonbreath hand cannon drop (kinda goofy looking IMO), it had the right speed, but rogues would freak out because it had the Agi & Stamina stats for them.\n- A lot of non-hunters didn't realize that it came with the staff, the lok'delar.  I remember a mage or priest dueling me, and the old tactic was to get into that sweetspot range where a hunter can't melee, can't shoot.  But he got too close and I whacked him with the Lok and killed him so he took a look at it, and was shocked.  It was also ilvl 75 like the rhok, but it had 73 dps, which was higher than most of the 2h weapons in MC, except from Rag.  But the stats it came with were awesome.  Int to boost your mana, +2 crit, it was really slow so the 2 melee abilities hit really hard (before all the normalization stuff).  It was really a huge upgrade.  But most hunters, I'd say probably all, didn't have their staff skill upgraded, so you'd see them in high level dungeons melee'ing everything with the Lok'delar, doing almost no damage, and pissing everyone else off, wondering what they were doing!  LOL good times!  The model for the lok was kinda plain, but came with the mongoose enchant look on it, the green flame off the top, so it was simple, but really cool.\n- The other part of the quest, which only hunters really understood, was the quiver you could get.  A lot of people probably still don't realize that hunters had to carry ammo, and they had a special bag that took up one of the 4 bag slots.  Before you got this special quiver, the biggest bag was usually from grinding AV, and was only 2 slots smaller, but this one gave a good buff too.  A lot hunters posted about having a hard time getting the sinew to drop, but if you went while you had the quest, all the hunters I talked to said it dropped in 20-30 minutes.  Mine did.  It could drop randomly for other players, so I think a lot of people tried to farm them to make money (sold for 200-500g, which was a ton), but I think hunters on the quest had a much higher chance.  It was worth it though. When wow removed quivers and ammo, Blizzard blessed hunters and turned it into a 24 slot bag.  I still stubbornly have mine!\n- Some people just couldn't kill the demons!  Oh it was fun to watch, listen to the other hunters swear and just lose it in voice chat (ventrillo in the old day!) trying to kill the demons.  On PVP servers it was painful to watch someone get close, and no one was there to keep the riff raff from the other faction out, because people love to be petty and interrupt it.  But most hunters that raided long enough, ended up having to kite at some point, and as long as you read someone's guide at the time (there were quite a few), so you knew what to expect and what skills to use, it took 1-3 tries on each demon.  But all 4 were made to use all the skills you should have, and it was extremely satisfying to finish.\n\nSo all you new hunters, the Rohk really is the best, until you get a lucky drop in Naxx maybe.","date":"2019-09-04T06:03:51-05:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"A fascinating look into the 2000s Classic contemporary.

I'd never gotten to experience it in the past since I started in BC so it's awesome to do it now (I've always been envious of the bow)!\n\nI mainly followed Vyzual's video on YouTube, [i][url=https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PiTGOvGuR-w]\"Wow Classic 2019 - Rokh'Delar 4 Demons Tutorial - 0 buff 0 help\"[\/url][\/i] - to complete my questline (hope I'm allowed to link vids, lol).\n[u]I didn't get any buffs beforehand and I didn't have any help between the demons.[\/u]\n\n[b][u]CONSUMABLES![\/u][\/b] [u]Not necessary to have damage-boosting ones[\/u], but nice nonetheless. Definitely recommend mana pots.\nI used [b]1 Elixir of Mongoose[\/b] for Silithus cause he was annoying which would have applied to Burning Steppes, but I died (rip). And then I highly suggest at least [b]1 Superior Mana potion[\/b] for both Un'goro and Winterspring then [b]2-3 Superior Mana pots[\/b] for both Burning Steppes and Silithus (could use Major Mana, but I like to save those for raid and pretty sure 2 Superiors is cheaper than 1 Major). I also ate maybe [b]5ish Grilled Squid[\/b], but again, not really necessary - just to speed things along.\n\n[b][u]UN'GORO![\/u][\/b] I killed Simone (the one with the pet) on the second try. I messed up, in the beginning, placing my trap on the pet so I had to Feign Death and try again.\n[b]Strategy:[\/b] Place a Freezing Trap down and have Cheetah on. Open up with an Aimed Shot into a Concussive Shot onto Simone. Her pet should aggro onto you, run towards you, and step over the trap - freezing it in place. The pet will simply disappear and you'll be left to kite Simone alone. Viper Sting her as she casts her ability, interrupting her, then keep on running and Auto-shotting. I weaved in Multi-shots usually right as she cast her ability, then Viper Sting, but you could probably do it the other way around. I stayed away from using Aimed Shot, but I'm sure you could sneak some in. To me, she is a little bit easier than the Winterspring demon.\n\n[b][u]WINTERSPRING![\/u][\/b] Killed Winterspring dude on the 3rd? try. I kept messing up on my aggro range trying to get too many autos in on him for expedited damage. Other than that, he's an alright kite. \n[b]Strategy:[\/b] You'll find him wandering the valley as a Tauren where it says on Wowhead, wait for him to get to a rock near the bottom of the valley, clear the way to the road beforehand, then kite him up towards the road and onto it towards Everlook. While you're going uphill and leveling off on the road, you're going to want to Concussive Shot as he seems to be a little speedier going uphill, at least in my opinion (this is usually where he got too close and I died). Other than that, keep Serpent Sting up and at the max range. Slow and steady wins the race here for sure! You can weave in autos if you'd like to try, but my kill was just taking it slow with Serpent Sting - I would definitely stay away from Aimed and Multis. Instead of trying to make sure you're weaving in Autos, you can just stick with [u]Rank 1 Arcane Shot[\/u] and blast him with that whenever it's off CD to make sure he doesn't de-aggro (Serpent Sting won't keep aggro by itself).\n\n[b][u]SILITHUS![\/u][\/b] I went and tried the Burning Steppes dude, but I failed like 5-6 times dying + 1-2 FD attempts before he despawned. x.x\nInstead, I went to Silithus demon where I died probably 3-4 times before getting the hang of my kiting pattern. I had him like 5-10% on my 5th try, but I didn't auto\/arcane enough and lost aggro.\n[b]Strategy:[\/b] I think Silithus demon is a little bit easier than Burning Steppes, but definitely a big step-up from the other two and where you might struggle some more and face despawns. I started when he was just entering the AQ gates area, near a sloped piece of grey ground. I put an Immolation Trap down at the start, then began a very intricate kite process to never be in melee range - jumping down at key points and then back up some stairs and down again. I really can't explain the kite pattern well, but it's on the video I talked about in the beginning. You really got to see it then get used to it yourself! I was Auto'ing whenever I could and wouldn't get dazed (Cheetah on, he still runs faster than you), weaving in Multis when I was at max range - but not a lot, definitely a slow fight with using mainly Autos and the occasional Serpent Sting (which I recommend). Also have [u]Arcane Shot Rank 1[\/u] on your bars somewhere to keep aggro so he doesn't despawn during your kite because there were some spots I couldn't stop without him catching up to me to Auto. It's easy enough to avoid the beetles as you kite, but you just gotta watch your footing. I did not use the Warlock fear-immune strategy here.\n\n[b][u]BURNING STEPPES![\/u][\/b] Ugh, this one, in my opinion, was the hardest out of the four. I tried him once, failed, and then finally got him again with no time to spare on my second attempt.\n[b]Strategy:[\/b] I HAD to go back to my trainer to learn Scatter Shot. I had tried it the first time without it and I don't think it's possible without it. Well, possible perhaps, but you have to be on top of everything! You can use Wing Clip Rank 1 or Rank 2 here, [u]I used Rank 1[\/u]. Start by placing a Frost Trap (slow) and opening at max range with Aimed, Auto, Multi, then kite back. When he's getting in-range, that's when I would suggest using Concussive as he's soon to enrage. Scorpid Sting gets rid of the enrage and while it's active on him, he only hits you for about 8-15 damage per melee hit. Once he's de-enraged, run at him, Wing Clip, and run through him. If he dazes you, this is when I would suggest using Scatter Shot - or saving it for emergencies when he's close to you and enrages and you need to build space for Scorpid Sting. Once at range, for me, it was about 1-2 autos, run in to Wing Clip him, then run back out and you should get in range because he's about to enrage again (another good spot to save Scatter Shot is for now, in case he dazes you for the 2nd run-in to Wing Clip). I was able to weave a few Multis in here and there, but I tried to focus on making sure I had rhythm the entire kiting process. Once you have your rhythm for kiting, Wing Clipping, and the like - that's when you'll kill this. As for your Aspect, Monkey if you're nervous about getting hit, but I used Hawk for extra damage on my Autos.\n\nOverall: I had a blast! I was frustrated, but in a good way where you know you've got this and once you've killed all four of them - euphoria! :p\nGood luck getting your Leaf and Sinews, fellow hunters, and happy demon hunting! >:D","date":"2019-10-09T00:54:03-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2019-10-09T00:58:34-05:00",2,"Cullitia"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":134,"id":3199982,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Otto61","body":"Just wanted to add a couple notes:\n\nSilithis & Steppes were both easy for me to \"cheese\" after practicing the jumps a bit.

In Winterspring, Silithus, Un'Goro Crater and Burning Steppes. Each demon will have to be done solo and all four have unique abilities. You can't use your pet! But you can take buffs before the fight. If anyone heals/buffs you while you are engaging the demon he will &quot;get bored&quot; and reset.<br /><br />After looting all four heads. Go to Felwood and you will get this beauty, as well as the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/?item=18715">staff</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>issachar</b></h3>As of patch 2.0 the new stats for this bow are as follows:<br /><br />Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers<br />Binds when picked up<br />Unique<br />Ranged	Bow<br />108 - 201 Damage	Speed 2.90<br />(53.3 damage per second)<br />Classes: Hunter<br />Durability 90 / 90<br />Requires Level 60<br />Equip: Increases your critical strike rating by 14.<br />Equip: Increases ranged attack power by 17.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>evoker</b></h3>Since the new patch went live, this bow has become superior (depending on your build ofcourse) to Huhuran's Stinger or Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Telefunken</b></h3>To get the quest, go to Felwood, Irontree Woods, and walk up on the island in the pond. Three big trees will appear giving you a quest. <br /><br />Other than stated above, you will also need Mature Black Dragon Sinew (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18705">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18705</a>) that drops from Onyxia in Dustwallow Marsh.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8312</b></h3>To get this bow you get the leaf from Majordomo Executus and you go to Irontree Woods in Felwood and go on the Island and talk to a big tree that appears and you will start the quest. In the quest you must kill 4 demons they are located in Burning steppes,Winterspring,Un'goro, And Silithus. You must kill each demon alone and no one can help you at all but you can get buffs before you start the fight. After killing each demon you loot the head and after you loot all 4 heads you go and turn in the quest. To get the bow you need to finish the quest and you need a Mature Black SInew from Onyxia. There is also a 18 slot quiver you can get and you need to get a Mature Blue Sinew and go to the tree and turn it in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8691</b></h3>Step by step of how to get this bow:<br /><br />1. Go to Molten Core, and defeat Majordomo Executus. He has a 50% chance of dropping this item, and this item or the Eye of Divinity will ALWAYS drop.<br />2. Go to Onyxia's Lair and kill her, she can drop the Mature Black Dragon sinew, a necessity for the quest.<br />3. Travel to the lands of Felwood, and Irontree Grove. Speak to the ancients on the hill and obtain their quest.<br />4. The demons are listed in no particular order.<br /> I. Winterspring - Artorius the Doombringer.<br /><br />1. Buffs - Intellect Buff is nice<br />2. Potions - Health/Mana and a potion for removing a magic debuff.<br />3. Group - At least 1 other to run in front of you and train the mobs.<br />4. Go to near Wintersaber Rock in Winterspring and look for a Tauren named Artorius the Amiable. Approach him when you are ready to begin the fight.<br />5. Begin Kiting Artorius towards Everlook, Serpent Sting is his weakness and so, run and use Rank 1 Arcane shot to keep him tapped and use highest rank Serpent Sting to bring him down. WATCH OUT FOR HIS DEMON DEBUFF.<br /><br /> II. Burning Steppes - Klinfran the Crazed.<br />1. Buffs - Mark of the Wild, Intellect<br />2. Potions - Health/Mana<br />3. Group - Not required<br />4. Approach Franklin the Friendly south of Blackrock Mountain to begin the fight.<br />5. The fight starts and he will periodically enrage. If he hits you while enraged, he can do upwards of 2000 damage. The Solution: Scorpid Sting. It unenrages him and makes him hit you for a measly 1 damage. Run in and melee for 2-3 hits, wing clip rank 1, and run out, he will enrage. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br /> III. Un'Goro Crater - Simone the Seductress.<br />1. Buffs - Fortitude, Mark of the Wild, Intellect<br />2. Potions - Health/Mana, Greater Nature Protection.<br />3. Group - Not required.<br />4. Approach Simone the Inconspicuous and her pet, Precious, wandering around the Hot Springs of Un'Goro.<br />5. As soon as the fight starts, run in and Freeze Trap her pet Precious. Proceed to Viper Sting her, it is her weakness, it will Silence her. Run in and melee until she begins casting. At this point run out and Viper Sting again, her lightning bolt HURTS. If you don't make it away in time, the Nature Protection Potion will help. Keep Precious Freeze Trapped until the fight is over, then you can kill him separately.<br /><br /> IV. Silithus - Solenor the Slayer.<br />1. Buffs - Everything you can get.<br />2. Potions - Health/Mana AT LEAST 2 GREATER SHADOW PROTECTION<br />3. Group - WARLOCK<br />4. Approach Nelson the Nice as he wanders around Southern Silithus.<br />5. BEFORE THE FIGHT: Duel the Warlock and have them Curse of Recklessness you. DO NOT END THIS DUEL. Have the lock keep using the curse every time it wears off.<br />6. Begin the fight and run in and Wing Clip Rank 3. It will immobilize him. Run out and shoot him, but keep moving in circles so his Creeping Doom Bugs don't touch you. They deal 150+ damage if they touch you. Every time he is un-immobilized run in and Wing Clip again. Repeat this tactic and keep using shadow protection potions.<br /><br />5. Return to Felwood to obtain your reward.<br /><br />OPTIONAL - Collect a Mature Blue Dragon Sinew (Azuregos or Elites in Winterspring) and bring it for an 18 slot quiver.<br />*NOTE* It is possible to group with another hunter, spawn the demon, and have them kill it for you. If you don't feel so hot about one of them, have your friend try :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8558</b></h3>Wasnt sure as to where to place a shot rotation guide for fellow hunters but since hunters get this bow it was the only logical place:<br /><br />Hunter Shot Rotations<br /><br />Clipped Rotation<br />A clipped Rotation is where you spam Multishot/Aimed Shot, you use them every time your timers are up, and if Multishot and Aimedshot both cooldown at the same time, you always use the aimed shot first.<br /><br />Full Rotation<br />A full rotation is where you would let your autoshot finish shooting before you would use your Aimedshot and/or Multishot. So if say you begin with an aimedshot, follow it up with autoshot, follow the autoshot up with a multishot, after the autoshot follwoing the multishot, you would wait for you next autoshot to finish shooting rather then instantly start casting Aimed Shot again.<br /><br />How to Know Which Shot Rotation to use.<br />For Rhok'Delar you would want to use a Clipped rotation since the High End Damage isnt very high, your autoshot would not be doing as much damage as say, Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting.<br />With the Xbow of Smiting you would want to run a Full rotation as the Autoshot does a significant Amount of damage.<br /> SERPENT STING IS A WASTE OF MANA<br />Preserve your mana for Aimedshot and Multishot, serpent sting does not output enough damage to justify the mana they use, so try to always use aimedshot and multishot. Only really usable when the extra DoTs are needed.<br /><br />Consumables are an amazing way to maintain your DPS.<br /><br />Buying Consumables such as Nightfin Soup, Lesser Mana Oil and Mageblood potions will increase your DPS by ALOT because of the mana regen, you might not think it but a hunter with alot of +mana per/5 is a hunter that is outputting alot of DPS.<br />Try getting your ZG Bracers and getting the +4 mana per/5 Enchant on them, also try to get your ZG Shoulders.<br /><br />Also bringing Major Mana Potions increases your dps alot, you shouldnt have to worry about it messing up ur Major Healing cooldown because well, your a hunter, your have feign death, use it and you wont need to use healing pots.<br /><br />Also a good way to increase your DPS by ALOT is by using a Flask of Distilled Wisdom.<br />I wouldnt reccomend using it unless we are trying really hard to bypass a milestone in AQ40, as it would increase your dps by ALOT.<br /><br />Im pretty sure this is right, start using a shot rotation in raids and you WILL notice your dps increase.<br /><br />Also if you pick up a Wolf Pup from LBRS, they have an AOE shout taht increases your next attacks attack power by 30, using it over and over in a raid will also increase your dps alot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In reply for *where do u get the Quest*<br />The Quest starts from when u get the leaf drop from MC after killing Major Dommo <br /><br />Hope this helps :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i've just killed klinfran the crazed and i wanted to thank you for giving us this cool guide. im now on the way for simone the seductress<br /><br />at the end you have made some mistakes<br />1.: the despawn of the demons is now 30 minutes because recent patch have modified the despawn time of these demons<br />2.:after you kill the demons and turn in the quests you gain an ancient rune etched stave wich is not a weapon just an item. You need to get the mature black dragon sinew from onyxia in order to create Rhok Delar/Lok Delar.<br />3.: the staff sucks its only good if you are farming demons in winterspring or in blasted lands. The Hakkari Warblade set with +15 agi enchant on each is better than any weapon-pair in the game!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>From what I've read, they just changed the respawn time of all the demons to 30 minutes, so it should be a lot easier to get now</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What many people doenst know is that someone who has done the 4 Demon Quest before can do it for you! He can attack and solo the demons for you without they despawn or do the famous 10k AoE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was wondering if you can get stuff and bow and use both, i seen hunters with both but i never got how that was bc the stuff forms in to the bow so idk can anyone tell me plz</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got the quest at my second run as ahunter in MC.had it for 3 months now.i did many runs so i could get some better gear to start the q.i also changed to herbalist so i can get the herbs that i need to make pots etc.if any1 got the q and needs some advice for it,well it requires patience,a stuborn head,never give up,do not hesitate to pay some repair bills and dont trouble your mind if some1 screws your q.there will be lots of *!@#heads that will hit the demons so you can fail.you can check the videos of how to do it,but.as many advices you get and as many videos you see,you cant know for sure what are you dealing with.its a hard quest but not but not impossible.good luck to all who is trying to get Rhok'delar.its an awesome bow</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>its the bow that shows ppl u r a real hunter, got it withn 7 hours after i got the leaf and sniew, few ptions and 1 lock for the demon in silithus, thats all...&nbsp; learn to kite, learn to be a hunter<br />p.s.&nbsp; The demon in silithus and Ugo r ezy as i did it on the first try, but not the one in WS and BS coz of horde gankin all the time. ppl who gank the hunter while they doing the quest r worthless, got the demon in WS at 3% and a lock ganked me, got the demon in BS at 7% and a grp of hordes ganked me,&nbsp; wondering if all horde like that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Scorpid sting no longer affects the burning steppes demon as it did before the patch.. I asked a GM about this.. he said it is working as intended and there are no known bugs, yet he couldn't explain how scorpid sting worked before the patch and how does it work nowadays. I had a nightmare killing the burning steppes demon, since I had ~ZG level equipment that time.. a nightmare really.. I completed the hunter epic quest the night before BC arrived, but I don't think that it worths the effort if you have BC. But it was a good, a very good challange. Now that blizzard took away kiting world bosses and such from us the hunter epic quest is the biggest and maybe the only bigger challange in a hunter's life ^^<br />By the way.. You can get an equal, even better bow (Splintermark) from Therokkar forest PVP vendor, you can get blades in BC instances equal to the staff and quiver equal to the epic quiver from AV PvP vendor.<br />/whine<br />When I saw Splintermark something broke inside me.. It was like: 'Man... I worked so hard for this bow, spent an assload of money on potions, a lot of time to get the sinew, the petrified leaf, DKP, whatever. Done the demons all alone, died many times, started over, paid for the potions, the repair bills again, I invested much effort in this bow.. And now here I am, standing at this vendor at LV 62 and now every single person can buy this bow for a maximum of one crappy hours of effort. It is even possible to farm the 15 honor hold marks in 5 minutes if you are lucky enough... So 5 minutes effort bow &gt; a work of severeal weeks.. Thank you blizzard.<br />/whine</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For any one that has trouble with the demons for this quest:<br /><br />If you do not know how to &quot;kite&quot; DO take the time before hand to learn.<br /><br />Silithus Demon: Bring friends! get buffs that last 10mins or more, including greater blessings if your on allience. Before you enter combat with him, duel your warlock friend (gets a Healthstone also!) Have him cast curse of recklessness on you. This will make you immune to the fear effect, but not the shadow damage. The demon will NOT despawn, as the warlock is not affectly &quot;helping&quot; you, he is considered hostile. He can also refresh the curse while you fight.<br /><br />Burning Steppes Demon: Do NOT use tranqu shot! its a waste of mana! Scorpid sting will remove his frenzy effect.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone out there :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The reason blizz chose a bow and a staff is because no races have a racial + to either thus making it a fair reward.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd say keep it in staff form for the stat bonuses and +2% Crit chance. 44.0 DPS is nice, but I'd take Striker's Mark and the staff over this bow.<br /><br />Oh, and an easy way to beat the quests for this staff/bow is to get together a group of your friends, get every buff imaginible, drink lots of potions, and make sure BOTH of your weapons have a demonslaying enchant. Before battle, drink an elixer of Demonslaying and have a couple on hand in case it wears off.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For those hunters on the quest:<br /><br /><b>Un'Goro</b> - Drop Freezing, Target Simone, aimed + concussive. Pet will freeze. Keep Viper Sting on her and kite her back a little bit. Melee her down. If you have counterattack, deterrence, scatter shot, use it when her pet gets to you.<br /><br /><i>note:</i> Used Elixir of Demonslaying, Major Rejuvenation x1. Also dual wielded with Demonslaying on both and use Aspect of the Monkey. <br /><br /><b>Burning Steppes</b> - Activate him in the NW corner near that Altar. Kite him up top and just scorpid, run in and melee for roughly 5 seconds, wing clip and get away. Whenever he frenzies just wait a second, scorpid and repeat. <br /><br /><i>note:</i> Didn't use any potions. Just used Aspect of the Monkey and dual wielded demonslaying enchants. This is all about timing. <br /><br /><b>Silithus</b> - Wing clips immobilize him. Put Rank 1 arcane shot on your action bar. When he fears its a ~600dmg DD and if you don't keep hitting him he'll deagro. After fear wears off quick arcane rnk1 and just avoid the bugs. You CAN use volley on them but I think it's easier to run around him in a circle and just shoot him, they are slow enough.<br /><br /><i>note:</i> Greater Shadow Protection x1 (2 in some cases when the fight lasts a bit), and Major Rejuvenation x1.<br /><br /><b>Winterspring</b> - My favorite. Actually had to kill this one 3 times for a few of my guildmates. (This was post 1.6, and as long as you have the quest and are partied you can kill them for other hunters.) It's all about the strafe keys (Q,E). Activate him in the southern most part of his path. Theres a cut through the mountains that lead to the road. Rank 1 arcane, Aspect of the Cheetah, and Serpent is all you need. Just start with serpent, and run, just hit him with a jump shot Rank 1 arcane as soon as it refreshes to keep him agroed. (Jump shot is just jump and when you're in the air shoot, lol.) Reapply serpent as soon as it fades and just get him to the road. Kite him all the way down to Everlook and he should be dead before you actually get to the town if serpent was applied as soon as possible.<br /><br /><i>note:</i> The only thing here is to have people clear the mobs out of the area for you, at least up to the road. And all you need to worry about once you hit the road is the opposing faction or the wandering Winterfall messenger pacl.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Aug 23 15:43:40 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I guess being able to change into a staff is somewhat decent, since Hunters are better at 2 hand weapons than 2 one hand weapons. It certainly saves you time and money for searching for awesome variations of both. However, I wonder, if you break the staff, would the bow also be broken, and vice versa?<br /><br />Is is a drop, and if not, who makes it?<br /><br />Edited, Sat Apr 23 09:42:52 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a quest item. The quest starts from a leaf you find in the chest after beating Majordomo in Molten Core. You turn the quest in to *figure it out yourself*. After this, he gives you three quests, where you must kill Azuregos, Onyxia, and three demons. The demons are level 60 elites, and require that you have no help. This includes healing, buffs during the fight, and fighting from other players. Also, you cannot use your pet to fight these demons. Sound crazy? It is. It hasn't been done yet to my knowledge, but three of the four have been beaten. The bow turns into a 73dps staff. <br /><br />Edit: Beat by one minute.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The road to this weapon is a road of hell.<br /><br />First you must get the quest from a run in MC, then sinews from killing Onyxia and Azuregos. But that's the easy part.<br /><br />Next you have to kill 4 level 60-61 demons in Winterspring, Un-Goro, Silithus, and Blasted Lands. But you must Solo the demons, if a Horde or Alliance player so much as sneezes on him, it goes home to cry to it's mommy.<br /><br />No biggie, grab a healer and bring that bastard on. But what's that? If you're healed or buffed during the fight, the demon gives you the finger and dissapears.<br /><br />That's painful, but they're 60 or 61 elites right? That turtle or bear never did wrong, unless...no how could they...yep. Your pet so much as touches them the demon will also dissapear.<br /><br />So it's down to this. No assistance, no buffs, no heals, no pets. You alone against the demon in a massive kitefest of doom. And if a horde player comes around to poke the demon, you're screwed and have to start the fight all over again.<br /><br />However, you will be able to get buffs before the fight. So you'll need healthstones potions, marks, forts, DM buffs, felwood buffs and Blast land buffs. <br /><br />Goodluck to all you aspiring hunters.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you are having trouble with the Winterspring Demon, try this. Pop a greater shadow prot. potion and wait for the cool down. Also, make sure you have some Resotritave Potion (very east quest picked up from the guy on the second floor at the inn in Kargath). Assuming you start at the rocks and work your way up the hill, he might get turn you into a demon. When that happens pop the Restore potion. The shadow protection pot. will help absorb some of the damage while the Restore potion kicks in. The Restore potion lasts for 30 secs and runs with the normal potion timer. Anyways, as I rounded the hill towards the road I was turned into a Demon twice but coth times it was removed, once on the road, never had a problem....Just an idea, hope it helps :)</div>

In the last nine Domo runs that the guild has done (the number of runs since I started being able to tag along), only two actually dropped the leaf. I hope I can get in this week, because either the random number generator is broken on Dragonmaw, or it's due to drop the leaf again. (Yes, I know it's statistically the same drop rate, but it's encouraging to think that it'll actually drop.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Blizzard CM announced on forums that Azuregos will be removed from hunter epic quest in future patch.<br /><br />Reason pet can not be used to help you is because pets are coded to act as party members for buff reasons. Game sees pets as another person. So hunters would quickly dismiss thier pets and use a guild Paladin instead. Paladin using Consecrate to hold hate and hunter with ranged DPS would mean demons dropped really fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My guild is in BWL and with the possibility of getting Heartstriker - same dps, about the same speed, only difference is the +9 stam for the Heartstriker, and the +1% to crit for R'hok.<br /><br />Which one would you choose. It seems like, Heartstriker would actually be better because it would allow you to control your DPS better. <br /><br />Is it worth the hassle of getting r'hok/Lok, or just raid, raid, raid, saving DKP for Heartstriker, when it drops. Right now I use blastershot, which I personally love. <br /><br />It seems like R'hok/L'hok is more of a status symbol than anything...especially with AQ/BWL drops that are coming out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the only reason ranged weapons are being buffed is because agi now only gives 1 AR...which means if u lose lets say 350 ranged AR in BC...thats about 35 dps there so the higher bow damage accounts for that</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lorelander</b></h3>It seems to me that this is the most epic bow pre-BC a hunter could get... considering the stats of some other weapons I know this may sound absurd, so please stick with me for a minute. I don't consider this the best bow due to stats, because clearly it's not. Rather it's the most epic bow due to the series of quests you had to complete to obtain the bow.<br /><br />The quests require a hunter to go solo against four elite demons. A single buff, heal, point of damage or etc. from another player was enough to reset the encounter. Basically anything that put another player on the demon's aggro table reset the encounter. These quests were custom created so that you and only you could defeat the demons. So if you have this bow it meant you learned how to play... There wasn't much you could do to get around this shy of having someone else play our account.<br /><br />Thus I consider this the closest thing in the game to graduating from college for a hunter. On a guild application the Rhock indicated this players can kite, dps hard, manage aggro, and etc. I can't think of a single piece of hunter gear that indicates as much about a hunter's skill than the Rhok.<br /><br />Don't confuse what I'm saying here, it isn't the best bow DPS and stats wise, but rather the best bow for proving one's merit as a epic hunter.<br /><br />(reposted from the &quot;Live&quot; version)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PalarishaMalf</b></h3>With classic coming out, and me still transmog'ing my ranged weapon to the trusty Rhok, I was reading the comments section here and thought I'd post a few thoughts, for those of us that got the rhok and lok back in the day, and for those people that really didn't know anything about it and now find out it's the BiS, since it hasn't been available in a really long time, and a good portion of the fanbase wasn't even born when it was.<br />- If you were in a guild that raided MC and Onyxia regularly, even if there were 10 other hunters, you eventually got the leaf for yourself. But if you were like me, 5 priest drops happened first, then the one week you couldn't make the raid, it dropped, and it didn't drop again for you for another couple weeks. But the wait was worth it.<br />- Most hunters had crappy weapons when they got the rhok and lok, so it was a huge upgrade. MC bosses didn't drop a lot of gear on each boss in general, and mean/ignorant guild leadership didn't always give the few other ranged weapons to hunters, so it was rare to get anything until the leaf, which only hunters could get. I know it sounds absurd, but if you lived getting passed up by a rogue with a bajillion DKP, you know the pain. Myself, when I got it I had a blue bow from one of the 50+ dungeons (because Mag NEVER dropped his bow) and one of those level 57 green axes that looks like a ninja star on a toothpick (but it was all agility so kinda OP for a green). But you went from a ilvl ~60 bow with ~30 dps to ilvl 75 (which was what the stuff in BWL was) with almost 44 dps. It was a big deal. And the model is still so cool. Shiny metal with vines and wood, and little flowers that constantly bud. Still think it's the best looking bow Bliz ever made.<br />- One of the best things about the rhok was the shot speed, at 2.9. Until like WotLK I think, the hunter auto shot timer reset anytime you used an ability, whereas right now it just goes off regularly at whatever rate it's set to. So hunters had to learn to use their abilities in between that shot timer, called it shot weaving. Most bow speeds were mid to high 2s, most guns were faster, and most crossbows were way slower. But you wanted the speed just long enough so you could weave in your aimed shot, which was a 3 second cast. But with raid buffs and whatnot, it was usually 2.8. So with lag accounted for, the Rhok was perfect at 2.9. Blizzard really thought out weapons back then. But that shot speed had a HUGE impact on hunter DPS. The bow off Mag and the gun off Golemag in MC were both too fast. So you could use it, but you'd constantly be extending your shot timers. Even when BWL came out, the Heartstriker bow was too fast, the crossbow off Chrome was too slow, and if you ever had a dragonbreath hand cannon drop (kinda goofy looking IMO), it had the right speed, but rogues would freak out because it had the Agi &amp; Stamina stats for them.<br />- A lot of non-hunters didn't realize that it came with the staff, the lok'delar. I remember a mage or priest dueling me, and the old tactic was to get into that sweetspot range where a hunter can't melee, can't shoot. But he got too close and I whacked him with the Lok and killed him so he took a look at it, and was shocked. It was also ilvl 75 like the rhok, but it had 73 dps, which was higher than most of the 2h weapons in MC, except from Rag. But the stats it came with were awesome. Int to boost your mana, +2 crit, it was really slow so the 2 melee abilities hit really hard (before all the normalization stuff). It was really a huge upgrade. But most hunters, I'd say probably all, didn't have their staff skill upgraded, so you'd see them in high level dungeons melee'ing everything with the Lok'delar, doing almost no damage, and pissing everyone else off, wondering what they were doing! LOL good times! The model for the lok was kinda plain, but came with the mongoose enchant look on it, the green flame off the top, so it was simple, but really cool.<br />- The other part of the quest, which only hunters really understood, was the quiver you could get. A lot of people probably still don't realize that hunters had to carry ammo, and they had a special bag that took up one of the 4 bag slots. Before you got this special quiver, the biggest bag was usually from grinding AV, and was only 2 slots smaller, but this one gave a good buff too. A lot hunters posted about having a hard time getting the sinew to drop, but if you went while you had the quest, all the hunters I talked to said it dropped in 20-30 minutes. Mine did. It could drop randomly for other players, so I think a lot of people tried to farm them to make money (sold for 200-500g, which was a ton), but I think hunters on the quest had a much higher chance. It was worth it though. When wow removed quivers and ammo, Blizzard blessed hunters and turned it into a 24 slot bag. I still stubbornly have mine!<br />- Some people just couldn't kill the demons! Oh it was fun to watch, listen to the other hunters swear and just lose it in voice chat (ventrillo in the old day!) trying to kill the demons. On PVP servers it was painful to watch someone get close, and no one was there to keep the riff raff from the other faction out, because people love to be petty and interrupt it. But most hunters that raided long enough, ended up having to kite at some point, and as long as you read someone's guide at the time (there were quite a few), so you knew what to expect and what skills to use, it took 1-3 tries on each demon. But all 4 were made to use all the skills you should have, and it was extremely satisfying to finish.<br /><br />So all you new hunters, the Rohk really is the best, until you get a lucky drop in Naxx maybe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cullitia</b></h3>Got my bow last week! ^.^ It was such a fun questline and definitely makes you feel so accomplished as a Hunter. I'd never gotten to experience it in the past since I started in BC so it's awesome to do it now (I've always been envious of the bow)!<br /><br />I mainly followed Vyzual's video on YouTube, <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiTGOvGuR-w" rel="nofollow">&quot;Wow Classic 2019 - Rokh'Delar 4 Demons Tutorial - 0 buff 0 help&quot;</a></i> - to complete my questline (hope I'm allowed to link vids, lol).<br /><u>I didn't get any buffs beforehand and I didn't have any help between the demons.</u><br /><br /><b><u>CONSUMABLES!</u></b> <u>Not necessary to have damage-boosting ones</u>, but nice nonetheless. Definitely recommend mana pots.<br />I used <b>1 Elixir of Mongoose</b> for Silithus cause he was annoying which would have applied to Burning Steppes, but I died (rip). And then I highly suggest at least <b>1 Superior Mana potion</b> for both Un'goro and Winterspring then <b>2-3 Superior Mana pots</b> for both Burning Steppes and Silithus (could use Major Mana, but I like to save those for raid and pretty sure 2 Superiors is cheaper than 1 Major). I also ate maybe <b>5ish Grilled Squid</b>, but again, not really necessary - just to speed things along.<br /><br /><b><u>UN'GORO!</u></b> I killed Simone (the one with the pet) on the second try. I messed up, in the beginning, placing my trap on the pet so I had to Feign Death and try again.<br /><b>Strategy:</b> Place a Freezing Trap down and have Cheetah on. Open up with an Aimed Shot into a Concussive Shot onto Simone. Her pet should aggro onto you, run towards you, and step over the trap - freezing it in place. The pet will simply disappear and you'll be left to kite Simone alone. Viper Sting her as she casts her ability, interrupting her, then keep on running and Auto-shotting. I weaved in Multi-shots usually right as she cast her ability, then Viper Sting, but you could probably do it the other way around. I stayed away from using Aimed Shot, but I'm sure you could sneak some in. To me, she is a little bit easier than the Winterspring demon.<br /><br /><b><u>WINTERSPRING!</u></b> Killed Winterspring dude on the 3rd? try. I kept messing up on my aggro range trying to get too many autos in on him for expedited damage. Other than that, he's an alright kite. <br /><b>Strategy:</b> You'll find him wandering the valley as a Tauren where it says on Wowhead, wait for him to get to a rock near the bottom of the valley, clear the way to the road beforehand, then kite him up towards the road and onto it towards Everlook. While you're going uphill and leveling off on the road, you're going to want to Concussive Shot as he seems to be a little speedier going uphill, at least in my opinion (this is usually where he got too close and I died). Other than that, keep Serpent Sting up and at the max range. Slow and steady wins the race here for sure! You can weave in autos if you'd like to try, but my kill was just taking it slow with Serpent Sting - I would definitely stay away from Aimed and Multis. Instead of trying to make sure you're weaving in Autos, you can just stick with <u>Rank 1 Arcane Shot</u> and blast him with that whenever it's off CD to make sure he doesn't de-aggro (Serpent Sting won't keep aggro by itself).<br /><br /><b><u>SILITHUS!</u></b> I went and tried the Burning Steppes dude, but I failed like 5-6 times dying + 1-2 FD attempts before he despawned. x.x<br />Instead, I went to Silithus demon where I died probably 3-4 times before getting the hang of my kiting pattern. I had him like 5-10% on my 5th try, but I didn't auto/arcane enough and lost aggro.<br /><b>Strategy:</b> I think Silithus demon is a little bit easier than Burning Steppes, but definitely a big step-up from the other two and where you might struggle some more and face despawns. I started when he was just entering the AQ gates area, near a sloped piece of grey ground. I put an Immolation Trap down at the start, then began a very intricate kite process to never be in melee range - jumping down at key points and then back up some stairs and down again. I really can't explain the kite pattern well, but it's on the video I talked about in the beginning. You really got to see it then get used to it yourself! I was Auto'ing whenever I could and wouldn't get dazed (Cheetah on, he still runs faster than you), weaving in Multis when I was at max range - but not a lot, definitely a slow fight with using mainly Autos and the occasional Serpent Sting (which I recommend). Also have <u>Arcane Shot Rank 1</u> on your bars somewhere to keep aggro so he doesn't despawn during your kite because there were some spots I couldn't stop without him catching up to me to Auto. It's easy enough to avoid the beetles as you kite, but you just gotta watch your footing. I did not use the Warlock fear-immune strategy here.<br /><br /><b><u>BURNING STEPPES!</u></b> Ugh, this one, in my opinion, was the hardest out of the four. I tried him once, failed, and then finally got him again with no time to spare on my second attempt.<br /><b>Strategy:</b> I HAD to go back to my trainer to learn Scatter Shot. I had tried it the first time without it and I don't think it's possible without it. Well, possible perhaps, but you have to be on top of everything! You can use Wing Clip Rank 1 or Rank 2 here, <u>I used Rank 1</u>. Start by placing a Frost Trap (slow) and opening at max range with Aimed, Auto, Multi, then kite back. When he's getting in-range, that's when I would suggest using Concussive as he's soon to enrage. Scorpid Sting gets rid of the enrage and while it's active on him, he only hits you for about 8-15 damage per melee hit. Once he's de-enraged, run at him, Wing Clip, and run through him. If he dazes you, this is when I would suggest using Scatter Shot - or saving it for emergencies when he's close to you and enrages and you need to build space for Scorpid Sting. Once at range, for me, it was about 1-2 autos, run in to Wing Clip him, then run back out and you should get in range because he's about to enrage again (another good spot to save Scatter Shot is for now, in case he dazes you for the 2nd run-in to Wing Clip). I was able to weave a few Multis in here and there, but I tried to focus on making sure I had rhythm the entire kiting process. Once you have your rhythm for kiting, Wing Clipping, and the like - that's when you'll kill this. As for your Aspect, Monkey if you're nervous about getting hit, but I used Hawk for extra damage on my Autos.<br /><br />Overall: I had a blast! I was frustrated, but in a good way where you know you've got this and once you've killed all four of them - euphoria! :p<br />Good luck getting your Leaf and Sinews, fellow hunters, and happy demon hunting! &gt;:D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Otto61</b></h3>Just wanted to add a couple notes:<br /><br />Silithis &amp; Steppes were both easy for me to &quot;cheese&quot; after practicing the jumps a bit. I think both were 2-3 tries that I could easily feign death out and retry. Having Shadow Protection Potions for Silithis helped quite a bit. <br /><br />Winterspring was my biggest concern having helped someone earlier with it... <br /><ul><li>I was well stocked on Restorative Potions which dispel the debuff if you get too close and I barely killed him after getting the debuff and melee'ing him to death... very stressful. This one took about 10 tries for me and 3 actual deaths - if you have a priest/pally/shaman friend to rez you it can be helpful, but I personally didn't want an audience and the graveyard is close anyways.</li><li>My last three attempts were great with just Restorative Potion and the &quot;RangeDisplay&quot; addon which will show you if you're holding the 30-35 yards, 20-30 is a danger zone and you may get debuffed, 36-41 is a bit too far and he may reset, but I seemed ok holding this for a bit as long as viper sting was up and I had recently done a Rank 1 Arcane Shot. </li><li>If my last attempt was unsuccessful, I definitely would have added Rank 1 Serpent Sting to my action bars because I was very low on mana. </li></ul><br /><br />Un'Goro was odd and took the most tries... <br /><ul><li>I tried the jump strategy, but you'll have to reset if you fall in the bug pit and getting dazed a bit made it really tough to do. </li><li>I then tried a full melee strategy with a ton of buffs (Winterfall water, Strength elixir, Nature Protection potion, Mongoose) and got her to ~10% wingclipping both and potioning towards the end. </li><li>I eventually had success by using Aspect of the Wild, not worrying too much about melee damage and just kiting the demon with wing clip &amp; concussive shots. You can just walk away backwards from her and melee until she starts casting, then turn to get space &amp; jump shot a vipersting. I only pre-potted with a nature protection potion on this attempt. </li></ul></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>polk</b></h3>Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers, is a legendary weapon for hunters in **World of Warcraft Classic**, known for its unique questline and powerful stats. This epic bow is obtained through a challenging journey that requires players to defeat powerful demons across Azeroth, testing their skills and mastery of the hunter class. Crafted from the enchanted wood of an Ancient Keeper, Rhok'delar is not only a symbol of dedication but also one of the most iconic weapons in the game. Its combination of high damage and useful bonuses makes it a prized possession for any hunter seeking excellence in both PvE and PvP combat.</div>
