<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Picked the book up off boss in North Instance then realised once back in Orgrimmar that you need to complete the quest back in the library....luckily you can solo your way back into library by carefully walking around ogres in the first courtyard and being lucky. Reward is trinket with following stats: &quot;+10 fire resistance, increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 15&quot;<br />Interested in knowing what people think of use of these stats</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Calm down, its simply a trinket to help with Fire resistances for MC/Onyxia.&nbsp; If your guild isn't doing that type of stuff sell the book.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well i do Play a Shaman, i can tell you a few things that i have discovered hehe.<br /><br />the guys who wants to nerf shamans usually are the ones that seems to think we have all talents maxed out...<br /><br />we have the Elemental tree if you max that out you are a fairly good spell caster, but shamans shock spells are so incredibly mana inefficient its not even fun. with this against mobs you take out 1-2 normal mobs the same lvl as you are and then you are all out of mana, and with this tree maxed out, well your melee blows so bad you wanna cry, your healing abilities about a lvl 30 druids...ohhh joy.<br /><br />Or we have the Enhancment tree. Max this one out, you cant heal, your shock spells still work but eats a LOT of mana, and no you cant still heal worth *!@#, but you can melee, about as good as a warrior with only lvl 40 items, and no talent points spent.<br /><br />Or we have the Restoration tree, now this is the only one that would be worth maxing out, mana tide totem you get a lot of mana back fast, you have rather good heals and 1 insta cast heal, and your mana and health totems can be used somewhat (although never when you fight alone) But now consider this, we cant melee worth $%^&amp;, out shock spells costs so much mana we cant use them because then we couldnt heal, so what would we kill anyone&nbsp; with?<br /><br />The only way that actually works is use 2 trees so you get some melee capabilities and either shocks spells or healing. now our healing spells are much more mana efficient then our shock spells so i would always go Enchancment/Restoration build for solo play.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>for the PvP things. Most guys that fights shamans usually try to dish out as much damage as they possibly can in as a short ammount of time they can. this doesnt work against a shaman that uses the Restoration tree he will outlast you as he has 1 insta heal for about 1500 health, and a improved lesser healing wave so you wont interrupt it in 75% of the cases. Now if you would take it slow and easy and just try to hinder the shaman from healing instead, you would win very easy.<br /><br />Against a Melee Shaman, well our main source of damage will come from melee and shock spells as backup (slow, interrupt or dot) and now when we have spent so much mana on the shock spells we have no mana to heal with, or we could save mana for heals and any fighter class would melee us to bits if we dont get very lucky with windfury.<br /><br />Or we have the Elemental tree + Melee now this is very hard to beat in 1 on 1 PvP, our main soure of&nbsp; damage comes from melee, we will slow you with FS and EBT, melee you and just dish out so much damage with our shock spells you cant keep up with us in the DPS department, but this only works against 1 person after that we are all out of mana and sitting ducks to anyone else that wishes to have a quick snack.<br /><br />For Fighting Shamans try to Outlast us, interrupt our heals if you can. Shamans have the hardest time against Warriors and Rouges and shadow priests, Shadow Priests just deals so much damage and heals themselves we cant do @#$% almost :P Warriors with their massive Life and Armor takes away so much of our melee damage we have to reley on shock spells for damage, And Rouges With stunlock just takes us down to 30-40% health before the stun lock has went off, so we are stuck healing with your immense DPS And with mind numbing poisons....ouch ouch ouch.... <br /><br />Most People dont know how to fight a Shaman that is why they lose against us.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So what is needed to get the trinket aside from the book... pfft... Im so sick of people &amp;*!@#ing about shammies and pallies get a friggin life and learn to stay on topic...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I play shammy but i'm just wondering, why are u telling em how to beat us? =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>People that say shaman are overpowered are whiners.&nbsp; <br /><br />The hardest class to beat in the game is a well played druid hands down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For how much that book sell at the AH in your real? in mine is aroun 150-200 gold</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wow, I was just reading through the old comments there, and saw one by myself saying that I didn't care about the Fire Resistance.<br /><br />Well, it's been several months, and now I'm in GIMME FIRE RESIST GEAR NOW mode. Really want it for BWL (I've got 150 FR, which seems to be enough for a shaman in MC).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The book give you a quest that you finish in DM libram is easy to solo it (just time your shot)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As much as One on One PvP is fun and all, every class has their weak points against certain classes.&nbsp; Every class can beat any class if played right as mentioned above many times.. but in places like Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin, if you are running around on your own without some kind of backup (especially in AV) there's something wrong.&nbsp; Of course if you're fighting PvP in places like Tarren Mill or Astranaar, you're likely to be up against a different variety of talent builds.&nbsp; Many tuned more towards PvE than PvP.&nbsp; You might also find that you yourself are built for PvE and the players you tend to defend against are PvP built.&nbsp; I've had my wins, and I've had my losses.. against all classes.&nbsp; And as a Shaman I can say that those whining about nerfs and the like simply haven't found the class/talent build that works best for them.&nbsp; (Either that or they're all 12 year olds who do nothing but whine anyways.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So does this book drop from any of the bosses in any of the DM instances?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest can be done at 54 with the assistance from a person with the cresent key. I just baught the book on Spinebreaker and did it with a friend. You really dont need more then a Lesser Invisibility potion (But you can use a Invisibility potion if you would like to be safer). Since its such a short distance from the start of the instance past the first mob you only need one potion. <br /><br />The thing you need to look out for is the Dog Patrol, they spot you very easy because of there high stealth detection, I had to die once to learn to watch closer. <br /><br />When you go down the ramp to the left at the very beginning of the instance, try not to get to close to the mob at the bottom, jump off the side to get a little distance and then hug the corner of the next ramp down to the library door. Once you get into the library door you're in the clear. Enjoy you new Trinket when you finish that long run down the hall!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have a 60 shammy and i agree with &quot;60 shaman&quot; because if shammies were meant to just heal then y would they be able to wear mail, and use 2-H weapons?. Shammies are meant to back-up heal and tank, they can do just about anything when the main person set for the job dies. I hate the fact that i had to respec to resto to go anywhere. Like 60 shaman said if everyone (horde) doesnt like the totems like strength of earth, windfury, etc then ill switch to resto. and stay resto, but if they do like the totems then they need to stop complaining about how someone else plays and let shammies be part enhance and elemental if they want.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Skill outweighs class when it comes to the healing classes...&nbsp; <br /><br />60 Elemental/Resto Shaman here... Always on the top of the lists for healing, and i'm not even primarily specced in Resto.&nbsp; And yes, it's true Shaman's are best for mass healing rather than just MT healing - we've got the best most efficient spell for mass healing, chain heal, which if you use correctly will score you VERY little overheal.&nbsp; It's just right for keeping a raid alive for a long time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All of the Dire Maul books are easy to use.&nbsp; All you need to do is either buy it off the ah or get a group and farm DM.&nbsp; After you get the book you just need a rogue or a friend with the cresent key to open up the library door.&nbsp; You can easily avoid all the mobs on your way to the library door, but watch out for the pack of dogs they can be a little tricky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this is the only shaman book that drops in dire maul and it gives +23 spell damage and healing besides the 10 fire resistance, not 15 as posted below falsely<br /><br />Edited, Sat Sep 17 11:32:41 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got of a dusky tome at the end of DM east, very nice elemental shaman trinket.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So I'm assuming this is one if not the only shaman book that drops in Dire Maul? Too bad it's not Earth Shock...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the trinket gives 23+ healing and spells and it is in library in dm it is just to sneak there wery easy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have yet to see this on AH nor have i seen a shaman with the reward, which really sucks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have it but cant get into Dire Maul yet at 55 =/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Reward is a trinket that has +10 to Fire Resist and increases healing and damage spells by 15.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dammit i want this, i have checked the AH every day, and watched trade, no one my server seems to sell this, but every other shaman seems to have it, i need the FR and i am going for a spell dmg build for once i respec and go back to PVP<br /><br />someone one Eredar plz sell this to me!</div>
