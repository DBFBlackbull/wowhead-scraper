<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>moxiegirl</b></h3>BTW I do believe Horde can get this with the help of alliance of course ^^<br /><br />Have the Alliance friend complete the quest all the way to the point where they feed the chicken. With the Horde friend present, the chicken will lay the egg which if I remember correctly is lootable by anyone so the Horde friend can loot the egg and the Alliance friend and get the quest over again =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>39865</b></h3>Does this chicken have any use?I mean can you lvl it or something?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is obtained by unlocking a secret quest.&nbsp; Here are the instructions:<br /><br />1) Find any chicken. <br /><br />2) Spam /chicken at it for a while. <br /><br />3) When the message triggers, right click it and take the quest. <br /><br />4) Get the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1907/monster-staff-basic">Special chicken feed. </a><br /><br />5) /cheer the chicken (or any chicken) and give it the feed. <br /><br />Tips:&nbsp; There are chickens next to the Special chicken feed vendor.&nbsp; Also, making a /chicken macro is a huge timesaver.&nbsp; (not to mention useful in general.)&nbsp; =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>One thing that isn't mentioned above: When the chicken is ready to give you the quest, an exclamation point does not appear above its head like with most quest givers.&nbsp; Instead, the chicken's name goes from yellow to green.&nbsp; Apparently, clucking at it a while raises your reputation with it from neutral to friendly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, chickens also seem to have very short memories. (What can you really expect from a bird brain, anyway?)&nbsp; So from the moment it becomes friendly you have a very limited amount of time to right click on it, read and accept the quest before it forgets about you and becomes neutral again.&nbsp; Take too long, and you'll have to cluck for a while longer until you convince it to like you again.&nbsp; Also, continuing to cluck at the chicken after it has become friendly will not lengthen the amount of time you have.&nbsp; All that does is cut into your already limited time to get the quest.<br /><br />Hope these tips help you out.&nbsp; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For all the Horde Guys out there who want a chicken, check out the racing track in the shimmering flats. There you can buy a chicken pet for 1g.<br />The only difference is, that you have a box that you carry, not an egg.<br />So if you got the money it's much easier, especially on an pvp server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was in elwyn forrest and i spammed the chicken for like 2mins with that /chicken and i didnt get the quest. why is that?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>make a macro<br /><br />&quot;/chicken&quot;<br /><br />I spammed it about 200 times before the chicken turned green. Then a Paladin came and killed it, lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I picked this item up as an Orc Hunter. I didn't read the posts above, otherwise I would have noticed that I wasn't the first to get the chicken egg horde side, as the poster above beat me by 8 months.<br /><br />However, it is surely difficult to communicate with alliance in a way that they would understand how to complete this quest. You would think it would be easy enough for even ALLIANCE players to complete... but it took me 4 chickens and 6 alliance before someone had the brains to put 1 and 1 together.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just tried this as a horde person. Got the Special Chicken Feed thru the Gadgetzan AH. Found chickens in Barrens due south of the buildins onthe west side of the Durotar Bridge.<br /><br />Got, after spamming /chicken, the &quot;chicken looks up at you curiously, perhaps you should inspect it&quot; message. BUT the chicken never turned green.<br /><br />Went to Westfall and tried various chickens as this horde char. Again the same thing happened - the chicken never turned green and never got a ? over its head (like happens doing it w/ an Alliance - my alliance char has done it successfully).<br /><br />Oh well, seems Horde can't do it - shame. Horde should get a little bug pet like this or something. Sigh. And my Tauren so wanted a chicken. Moooooooo<br /><br />EDIT - I was WRONG - it IS horde-doable! I am on a pve server, so had an alliance mule do the quest. Human, ran out to saldean's farm, bought feed, went behind his house - got the chicken to lay the egg - and logged out without looting it.<br /><br />My Tauren had already camped there. He logged in and found the egg. Looted it! Got his chicken! moo! The tauren got there by taking zep to grom gol, swimming up to westfall, and running to saldean's farm.<br /><br />This quest is repeatable in that u can leave many &quot;eggs&quot; on the ground. U can only have one in your inv. So if someone steals your egg, just try again. GL!<br /><br />Edited, Sun Sep 4 08:36:52 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Easiest way for alliance is:<br /><br />1) Travel to Westfall.<br />2) Go to &quot;Saldean's Farm&quot; (north of the Flight Path town)<br />3) When standing by Farmer Saldean, there are many chickens infront of him.<br /><br />Copy and paste this text in a macro, and use it 5-8 times.<div class="quote-box">/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken<br />/chicken</div>Until the chicken is green and right-clickable.

Or just use /chicken macro again.<br /><br />You will see a egg spawn, just rightclick and open that.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok this is how it really goes. For the Alliance, Go to Westfall, then go to Saldean's Farm. Buy the seed from the farm guy. Then go to a chicken right outside the house. Make macro &quot;/chicken&quot; Do it until it says inspect, then take quest. Give him the seed and an egg will appear. Open it and there we'll be a chicken egg.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Roshkahl</b></h3>Working on getting some Achievements done prior to WotLK Classic launching. I picked this guy up as Horde.<br /><br />All you do is:<br /><br />1.Create a level 1 Human, kill some wolfs and get about 25c by vendoring trash drops.<br />2. Run your Human to Saldean's Farm in Westfall.<br />3. Create a /chicken emote macro.<br />4. Buy the Special Chicken Feed from Farmer Saldean.<br />5. Log off.<br />6. Get your Horde character to Saldean's Farm near the chicken you're going to emote.<br />7. Log onto your Human character and spam click the emote at a targeted chicken until they turn from neutral to friendly and give you a quest to feed it.<br />8. Feed the chicken and it will spawn an egg.<br />9. Log off your Human character.<br />10. Log onto your Horde character and loot the egg.<br /><br />Enjoy your chicken!</div>
