I do agree that rogues do need bows. I do agree that hunters need melee stuff. HOWEVER. A good sword\/dagger is FAR easier to come by (In quest rewards and prolly drops) Then a good bow is. In my lifetime on WoW, my hunter has seen about 3-5 good ranged weaps. My group was understanding and let me have them. What rogues seem to forget is that hunters do not JUST wear melee weaps. In fact, i like to use them very often. Wing clip is pwnage and raptor strike is decent. Do rogues have ANY skills for bows? Hunters sacrifice alot for their ranged weaps. Now.. I see rogues use ranged weapons for, um, PULLS. Hunters use ranged weaps, and are awesome for pulls. Do you really NEED to do just a bit more damage for the ONE shot you pull a mob with rogues? Hunters shoot tons of arrows\/bullets, and that means the extra DPS\/Agi is a big difference. I use my melee stuff quite often, my daggers are not just decorations (What do you think we do when lets say.. a warrior or rgue runs up to us? We sure as hell dont bash them with the butts of our rifles.) I use melee to conserve\/regen my mana, and conserve ammo when im running low... Which is rather frequent. Rogues may be bitter about hunters taking ranged weapons, but they are really the lifeblood of the hunter. Not only are bow\/guns expensive and hard to find, now rogues take them because they lost one little knife. Stop acting like children and consider the needs of others for once. I say that to keep both sides happy, hunters have first dibs on ranged, and rogues can have first pick of daggers in any of my groups.","date":"2006-01-30T07:29:38-06:00","rating":10,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ConcernedHunter","importedSubject":"Bows are for hunters."},{"commentv2":1,"number":8,"id":2635737,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Yes Hunters are primarily Ranged, yes they melee as a last resort, and YES they need good melee weapons (such as Dawns Edges and Bone Slicing Hatchets :P), so stfu, As a Paladin I have absolutely no Ranged attacks, save Hammer of Wrath (Which for the noobs who don't know yet, is used primarily to mow down fleeing Horde greifers) so you can see how my veiw is somewhat less biased than the greedy Warrior or Rogue posters who advocate rolling against a Hunter on this.\n\nTake Scolomanse or Stratholme, for exapmle, a Warrior\/Rogue with this bow, a +7 Scope, and Thorium Arrows will be lucky to do enough damage to visibly change the health bar of the elites in there with their 1 pulling shot, it's pure 'eye for an eye' bull^&*!, you don't even know the people you are abusing you ^&*!head...\n\nIf you had any brains you would stick with the Bow\/Gun you get from Nessingway when you kill King Bangladesh, and only roll on better weapons if there are no *real* need rolls.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7601</b></h3>This is probably the best looking and IMO best performing bow to get your hands on casually before entering MC, but it can be a real pain in the neck to obtain. All of the end bosses in Scholomance (Gandling excluded) have a chance of dropping this...a VERY slim chance. You can see this drop multiple times at the end of a run, or you could run Scholomance countless times and never see it. Good hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>...how many rogues out there roll on things like this, then proceed to complain if Hunters roll on a dagger or sword with Agi.&nbsp; Agi isn't only good for Rogues, folks.&nbsp; Helps hunters in numorous ways.&nbsp; Hell, it's our primary stat.&nbsp; Just ticks me off how many times me just ASKING about a dagger or sword or something and get sreamed at how I'm a hunter and should stick to bows, etc, etc. and then I see Rogues and Warriors (which is even worse) rolling on bows like this.&nbsp; I understand you guys use ranged, but understand we also use melle on occassion and that if it's ok for you guys to complain about we hunters looking for and asking about melee, we're gonna yell back just as hard about you guys trying to snatch away our ranged weps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well. I do agree that rogues do need bows. I do agree that hunters need melee stuff. HOWEVER. A good sword/dagger is FAR easier to come by (In quest rewards and prolly drops) Then a good bow is. In my lifetime on WoW, my hunter has seen about 3-5 good ranged weaps. My group was understanding and let me have them. What rogues seem to forget is that hunters do not JUST wear melee weaps. In fact, i like to use them very often. Wing clip is pwnage and raptor strike is decent. Do rogues have ANY skills for bows? Hunters sacrifice alot for their ranged weaps. Now.. I see rogues use ranged weapons for, um, PULLS. Hunters use ranged weaps, and are awesome for pulls. Do you really NEED to do just a bit more damage for the ONE shot you pull a mob with rogues? Hunters shoot tons of arrows/bullets, and that means the extra DPS/Agi is a big difference. I use my melee stuff quite often, my daggers are not just decorations (What do you think we do when lets say.. a warrior or rgue runs up to us? We sure as hell dont bash them with the butts of our rifles.) I use melee to conserve/regen my mana, and conserve ammo when im running low... Which is rather frequent. Rogues may be bitter about hunters taking ranged weapons, but they are really the lifeblood of the hunter. Not only are bow/guns expensive and hard to find, now rogues take them because they lost one little knife. Stop acting like children and consider the needs of others for once. I say that to keep both sides happy, hunters have first dibs on ranged, and rogues can have first pick of daggers in any of my groups.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes Hunters are primarily Ranged, yes they melee as a last resort, and YES they need good melee weapons (such as Dawns Edges and Bone Slicing Hatchets :P), so stfu, As a Paladin I have absolutely no Ranged attacks, save Hammer of Wrath (Which for the noobs who don't know yet, is used primarily to mow down fleeing Horde greifers) so you can see how my veiw is somewhat less biased than the greedy Warrior or Rogue posters who advocate rolling against a Hunter on this.<br /><br />Take Scolomanse or Stratholme, for exapmle, a Warrior/Rogue with this bow, a +7 Scope, and Thorium Arrows will be lucky to do enough damage to visibly change the health bar of the elites in there with their 1 pulling shot, it's pure 'eye for an eye' bull^&amp;*!, you don't even know the people you are abusing you ^&amp;*!head...<br /><br />If you had any brains you would stick with the Bow/Gun you get from Nessingway when you kill King Bangladesh, and only roll on better weapons if there are no *real* need rolls. That said, if there are no Hunters wanting this weapon it's a good Rogue/Warrior trinket.<br /><br />Either way, I'm glad you arn't on my server omgwtfpwnd, you wouldn't be running any high-end instaces for very long at all, we have a name for sore, gereedy losers with attitudes like yours: NINJA LOOTER! If you rolled need against a Hunter who needed this bow on Dragonmaw, the Master Looter (and the rest of the group) would laugh his/her arse off at you, Award the weapon to the highest rolling hunter, and take a vote from the party on cutting you loose :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Rogues: if a hunter stole a sword from you once, let bygones be bygones and let ANY hunter have this and go do a few Alterac Valleys til you get bloodseeker. stength+agi+higher DPS &gt; getting a bad rap for rolling against a hunter for this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Any other class rolling Need on this against a Hunter is simply a ninja-looter and should be blacklisted, kicked from their guild, have their character's reputation ruined, and forced to re-roll.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is the bow I still use as a 60 rogue.&nbsp; <br /><br />I waited until the hunter in our group said that he already had a better ranged weapon before I rolled on this with the warrior.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'll hold onto this one until I get a Heartstriker, but again, I will not compete with a hunter for a ranged upgrade; I carry this for the stats, and stats alone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a rogue and I feel I should say something here (something slightly more intelligible than the comment above anyway). I see a LOT of rogue bashing going on. Don't get me wrong, there are some really annoying players out there (and alot of them play rogues) but not all of them are bad.<br />I have done more than a few Scholo runs and have seen this bow drop 5 times. On every single run it dropped I passed on it because we had a hunter in the party. I got one eventually only because when I passed the hunter in our group said he had a better bow and the group all decided to let me have it.<br />I understand your frustrations as hunters being screwed out of a very nice, primary weapon for you. I just want you and every one else to know that not all rogues are bad. Some of us have the integrity to recognize that other classes have first rights to certain weaps...regardless of our needs.<br />And as a quick and slightly bitter aside...I have been screwed out of some very nice rogue gear by greedy hunters, so it goes both ways.&nbsp; &gt;;}<br /><br />cheers!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've lost it to 2 Rogues and 2 Warriors <br />Umm accuse me i am a hunter i use agi and the bow was a major big upgrade from me old one I NEED it. So why the heck does a warrior need a bow for they like use it once every kill and only caryy 200 bulets just not fair. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In answer to your question, rogues need bows because sometimes it is impractical or stupid to melee, E.G. Baron Geddon in MC, or Venoxis in ZG, both have powerful AoEs that can drop melee classes with under 6000 health in a matter of seconds... it is impractical/near impossible for healers to keep rogues health up in such situations so the rogues just sit back and plug em with teh ranged weapons... its a rare occasion, and its alot less dps than we're used to, but yes i think its definately a good reason.<br /><br />Although i have 2 rogues who use this bow, i concede that i would pass on it if a hunter in the group needed it (thankfully in my first group there was no hunter, and in my second the hunter had strikers mark)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>60 rouge here and though i want this wicked bow, it looks soo badass and agility is a rouges major stat, it droped today and a hunter was in group...of course i passed. hunters main weapon is there ranged, and rouge would make the second best use of this. but id also like to say ive been outrolled by hunters on many runs when the weapon ive spent days trying to get drops, not saying all hunters are like that but please , as a general note take into acount what class would most benifit and be courtious</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have Bloodseeker but i'd trade this for that any day since Bloodseeker is a PvP bow and this is more for instances, but why do rogues ninja this so much? One of my guidlies went to Scholo and a rogue ninjaed this from her. Me and her then made a Scholo grp and got a rogue. He said since he's the only rogue he gets the bow if it drops &quot;i guess&quot;. My guidlie whisped me and was like WTF? SO im like eh me and the other hunter have priority so if it drops only me and the other hunter's rolls count since we use bows most. He actually left after we entered the instance and then the whole grp collapsed. So rogues if there is ever a hunter in ur grp plz don't ninja it from them..if there isn't then the bow is all urs pretty much</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got beat out by a rogue for this 2 days ago. Jerk had 4 pieces of epic gear and I guess HAD to have this on top of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I get to one of the bosses that drops the ABB and it drops.&nbsp; My ML was a rogue and rolls need on it even though I clearly needed it as a MAIN WEAPON.&nbsp; He rolled a 96... THEN I ROLLED A 100 AND BEAT THAT MOFO!&nbsp; The Blizz gods have spoken, and the Ancient Bone Bow is a hunter weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On my hunter I did Scholo at least 10 times, Beastalker helm never dropped, in fact - nothing every dropped I could use. Then on the last time I went, this bow dropped. I was the only hunter. Was thrilled! Everyone was passing, saying congrats and then the warrior rolled need ..and won! He said &quot;I need to able to pull things from a distance&quot; I was absolutely pissed. Everyone in the group was ticked too. Then, something he came in Scholo for dropped and just to get back at him the pally in our group rolled need (which he did equip soon after, but he was originally not going to roll on it). The Warrior got pissed, said it was a warrior item (even though it had spirit) and left the group.. We finished the instance fine with the druid tanking. Is it just me, or shouldn't a hunter get first priority on bows over anyone else?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just did a run through scholo with a tank, mage, hunter, priest and myself (rogue).<br /><br />This dropped from one of the bosses, so the hunter needed it and I gave it to him (I was ml), the poor guy had done 30+ runs looking for it. Next boss and the bow drops, again! I got it this time :D Unbelievable!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On my 3rd scholo run<br />And here's a better picture of it, and me :)<br /><a href="http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/7918/bored22wt.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/7918/bored22wt.jpg</a><br /><br />Roark, 60 Hunter<br />&lt;Order Of Azeroth&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>*&lt;READ&gt;*<br /><br />1st of all, this would be a nice rogue or fury warrior wep. <br /><br />If there is a Hunter in your group that wants this clearly has authority over it. It IS a ranged wep. You tell me, who uses ranged more; a hunter, rogue, or warrior? Simple, a hunter does. Us hunters range more than rogues and warriors combined so ALL ranged weps whould go to hunter 1st unless he passes/doesn't need it. If you are a warrior or rogue and u need roll against a hunter you need to learn how to play. For hunters, every 1 agi is 2 attack power. I've seen(had) this bow &quot;ninja'd&quot; from me 2 times. A Prot spec warrior and a rogue, and they were kicked out of the group that instant by the leaders. I'm fine with rogues and warriors rolling, but not against a hunter. L2P noobs!<br />And i was reading and someone said that rogues and warriors are hard to be? I have a 60 rogue that is VERY easy to be, imo it's easier than a hunter. I have a 53 warrior, also, and yes ill admit you need to know what ur doing, but if u are a lvl 60 warrior and you still have trouble, Make a mage. Mages are the easiest class to be (and if u disagree, try some other classes 1st).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have easily run scholo 15x and this bow has only droped 2x. first time rogue took it and said agil is way more important to him than to me. i ignored him and warned my guild about him and they all ignored him too. but his guild said he was justified! 2nd time a warrior rolled on it and hearthed. he was ignored also by my whole guild and his guild werent a bunch of cluster !@#$ing noobs and they kicked him and ignored him. i found out later he had to re-roll because he couldn't get into presets or raids or anything. anyone who thinks tehy get to roll over a hunter should just uninstall the game, hunters use bows as our main weapons, if we rolled on agil and stam daggers people would go ape ^&amp;*! on us. but if a rogue rolls on a bow its ok... HELL NO! i hope you die a slow and painful death for that. especialy for doin that to people like me who have been looking for this bow for a long time and the times it pops up it is stolen by nooblets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you do realise that you have to kill several epic mobs and solo 4 elites for rhok right?<br />not exactly something obtainable by someone outside a raiding guild</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this bow is a very nice bow indeed. on my rogue i have ran scholo for this bow many times, ive seen it drop 3-4 times each time a hunter in the group rolled and i pass on it, and i now that i have a 51 hunter myself im lvling to get it. my rogue is lvl 60 and i have a lvl 60 warrior also, and i would never roll over a hunter for this. so if you do, your a selfish greedy bastard. let the hunters have this they will make far better use of this than you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have only run Scholo once and did not see it drop.&nbsp; I was forutnate to get my shadowcraft cap (I am a Rogue).&nbsp; For the most part Rogues will use a ranged weapon in the same manner a spellcaster will use a &quot;Held in off-hand&quot; item.&nbsp; When I run these types of instances it is mostly with my guild and perhaps a few Pick-Up members.&nbsp; When there is a hunter in the party I always ask them first if it is alright for me to roll on a ranged weapon and most of the time they say it is alright.&nbsp; 11 Agility makes this desireable for a Rogue, but the fact that this is a bow makes it not only desireable for a hunter, but useful as well.&nbsp; In my opinion I would say that a hunter should have first dibs on this.&nbsp; To put one thing in perspective, most guilds will run Scholo and Strat alot for AD rep and the set piece drops.&nbsp; So if I did not find it the first time then it would be no problem at all for me to wait for another run.&nbsp; Besides I have a green bow at this time that adds to agility and I would have to ask myself &quot;Do I really want to upset one of my guildies or anyone else for just a few additional points in Agility?&quot;&nbsp; If you are going for AD rep then you are most likely going to run Scholo more than once and your turn for the bow will come up eventually.<br /><br />PS: As stated in a comment above there are some points in end game instances where a rogue will use ranged, ZG is an example, but mostly they will be there for DPS.&nbsp; Having a good bow like this helps, but does not make you anymore efficient considering our role.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><u>This is a bow for both hunters and rogues</u>, Nice for Rogues for the agility havnt seen alot other bows before you go ZG,AQ20 and other raids that got more agility then a epic gun. And the Dal'Rend swords is for hunters to. Both off em with a total of +30 agility is the best weps a hunter can have before going ZG. If hunters wanna have a bit more chanse to win a good wep and dont disturbe rogues when rolling for it go Strat UD and get 2 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Bone%20Slicing%20Hatchet">Bone Slicing Hatchet</a> with agility enchants on. Im a hunter and i go for em, more chanse to drop and ALOT more chanse to have them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've already posted on this, and i still agree: i'm a 60 rogue, been playing for a while now, and this is a hunter bow FIRST -- i've seen it drop twice, and both times let the hunter snag it. <br /><br />*BUT* it is VERY useful for a rogue -- especially for a number of raid bosses where rogues have to do ranged; we end up having to do more ranged in endgame (both raids and PvP) than just when leveling, so bows are even more valuable, and the +11 agility cinches it. And it looks badass: this is not unimportant.<br /><br />And, because the bows that drop in ZG etc. are most likely NEVER going to end up going to a rogue, because a guild will always have hunters who need, the Bone Bow is the best chance for a rogue to have an endgame bow. So rogues: do scholo without hunters , or let people know ahead of time and see if its okay (I was even in a group where hunter told me I could roll if it dropped; it did but I still didn't roll). The argument over whether rogues need this is stupid; of course we do -- but after you damn hunters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been thru scholo like a million times and havent gotten it. It dropped once, but this guy ninjaed and that really pissed me off. Only time it has ever dropped fer me.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This bow has the potential to be the one of the strongest aimed shot bows in the game, not to mention one of the most unique...Look at the bow's damage 87-88 ....thats the most stable damage range of ANY weapon in the game...I got it tonight on stormrage and I have to say compared to gorewood its about even, but the stability of the damage is outstanding, you will always get a large hit due to the 87 minimum damage. Some of my higher hits while testing it out in TM were 2240 on a dwarf priest, and 2153 on a human priest. This weapon is definately extremely powerful in its uniqueness, pair it up with with an eaglehorn for autoshot and you've got a deadly pair of bows that'll last you till you get striker's mark :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped today at Scholomance from Alexei, hunter vs. Rogue for it, Hunter had the Gorewood bow.. The rogue was using a Harpyclaw Shortbow...<br /><br />Hunter complained that he needed it and eventually it was given to him by the ML...<br /><br />the ROGUE had more use for that bow that the damned hunter.. Hunter's should learn to stop their greed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok wait... Huricane has a better DPS (32.2) ((Yeah its not much)) Huricane is 1.6 speed vs this things 2.8 speed... So what you get a minor boost out of 11 agi.. other gear can make that up. This bow doesn't look all that good either. Its not the best looking in the game thats for sure.. As a lvl 56 hunter i'd pass on this since huricane is better. Kinda sad that a lvl 42 bow is better than a lvl 56 bow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this just last night on my second raid in there. This bow is SMOKIN hot and deals buttlods of damage. I average about 230 on a normal shot and have crit for almost 1900 with it already. Love it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anybody Seen the Bone Bow Post 1.10?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have a 60 hunter and I have been in so many Scholo runs that I have never seen this drop. All the last 6 bosses drop are stupid Dark Runes and MAYBE a piece of armor. Ok the Dark Runes are used alot by non-warlock casters, but come on, a lvl 60 instance with mostly trash drops from the bosses near the end?<br /><br />Feels like I have done so many scholo runs that I have gotten to Revered with AD by doing runs and very little else to raise rep with them. I think they need to adjust the chances on item drops vs Dark Runes. There are more than enough mobs in scholo to drop dark runes, so let the bosses get a better chance to drop a more diverse selection of lewt.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Every time this bow drops and the winner equips it, the entire raid wishes they'd rolled just because it looks awesome. It's pretty neat how it does +/- 1 dmg every time.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got mine last night, did about 8 or 9 scholo runs before and never saw it drop.<br /><br />Last night it finally dropped from Alexei, I needed and everyone passed.

Aimed shots on bunnies are about 2350. Gotta love 325+ agi without epics. (5/34/12 built btw).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Saw this drop after taking my hunter through this instance about 30 times.

This was a seriously good upgrade from my current bow. Lesson learnt, avoid pugs if possible :/ <br /><br />Rogue's, be decent and pass this if you have a hunter in your party that needs it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>damn nice bow:) 0.3 dps better then gorewood:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I didn-t even know that this bows droprate was so low... Oh well, no hunters in my party, so it's obviously a rogue bow :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Did my first (10 man) raid in Scholomance today, i came for the Beaststalker headpiece &amp; this bow.<br /><br />I was lucky this bow dropped of Lord Alexei Barov with only 2% drop chance!<br /><br />I compared it to the gorewood bow and guess? This bow is even better (as a hunter).<br /><br />With aspect of the hawk, trueshot aura &amp; sniper scope:<br />125 dps Bone Bow<br />124.7 dps Gorewood Bow.<br /><br />Not much difference, but at least you can say the Bone Bow is better for hunters. And the looks... this is the best looking bow in the game.<br /><br />Edited, Sun May 15 21:41:19 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>umm, how would the rougue have made better use of this? this is wayyyyyy better than gorewood for a hunter, and the only time a rougue or warrior should roll on this is if there is no hunter in the party orthe hunter has a better box/gun</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunter weapon in first place, then other classes. Prefer this over Hurricane cuz it deals major damage in 1 shot, and Hurricane does only scratches, but a lot of them. If u have some skill in stalking an enemy, and waiting until u can get Aimed Shot, this definitely pwns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>so i ran this place for like the 6th time and hey! it droped! so i was like holy !@#$ yeah dunadun dun, but the the rogue in the part who had <a href="/classic/item=18738/carapace-spine-crossbow">Carapace Spine Crossbow</a> thought he needed it more...i rolled a bloody 7 so the freakin rolugue got it. why is it that i didnt have firsat priority on the bow?<br /><br />edit: i had <a href="/classic/item=17753/verdant-keepers-aim">Verdant Keeper's Aim</a> well, i guess have it<br /><br />Edited, Sun Oct 23 18:06:47 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Went to Scholo specifically to get this bow. I was tired of the Hurricane and the low Aimed Shot crits. I was the only hunter in the raid group of 10. Everyone knew I was only there for the bow. After killing Lord Alexei Barov, it dropped. Everyone said, 'Give it to the Hunter.' Equipped it and went from under 700 Aimed Shot Crits to 1500-1700 Aimed Shot Crits using Thorium Arrows. Got to Doctor Theolen Krastinov and it dropped again! We couldn't believe it. Went to the warrior cause he wanted a better bow to pull with, lol. We debated if the game would allow me to drop out, raid get another Hunter in the group, let him get to the instance and summon him to the group. We didn't try it but we are all still wondering if it can be done.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunters have absolutely NO right to get mad at rogues for rolling on this. What, after all the other !@#$ you ninja from warriors.<br /><br />Payback time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's a pally weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Only one who wanted it, (am hunter), and I got it, I am marks/surv build and the +agi works well with the passive agi talent. <br /><br />critting 1900+ with AS and 600 with auto. got a 1000 crit with multishot on a rat. :D<br /><br />also it looks @#$%in sweet.<br /><br />PS. all the 'its a rog weapon' etc, this is turning into thott :-/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this bow is now safely in my hands</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped 3 times on 1 run. I got one. 2 rogues got the other 2. All In same guild :) was a good XMAS Eve for us</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bow dropped twice, i won the first, the other hunter was a little pissed because i also won Bone Golem Shoulders before...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got this on Bloodhoof server! WOOT!<br /><br />Once I added a sniper scope it did comparable DPS to the Hurricane. Much slower though which is an ammo saver. <br /><br />The look of this bow is worth it alone. Hurricane looks like a level 1 bow in comparison!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After a month of Scholo runs, I finally got the bow. Dropped of Barov.. damn it's nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a good bow, much better agi than gorewood. Went to Scholo for the first time for BS headgear, and wait Doctor Theolen Krastinov and Instructor Malicia both dropped it. Twice on the same run, good thing I was the only Hunter in group. I'm happy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Man alot of you guys are so lucky. I've done 11runs in 5days and still not 1 abb or bs helm. I would like to do more runs as I get nice xp and i'm lvl 59. Plus I get rep with AD and i'm an enchanter, but I can never seem to get a good pug. Only guilds runs actually make it past rattlegore. Its so sad that i've run scholo 11 times, yet i've never been to lbrs, past the FF room in ubrs, and never set foot in strat. I seriously think there is some secret rumor on my server talking crap about me. I couldn't get a damn brd group till I was lvl 57. There are more rogues and warriors with this bow than hunters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have this bow and dont really want to give it up...one the cosmetic effect is cool, two the max damage is really nice, ran a guildie through Deadmines and critted on CPT Greenskin for 3243 damage...i know outrageous buthey, my damage meter says im right:P Nice bow, next on my list of things to get is the Precisely Calibrated Boomstick...just to see how it works out i mean 1.5 attack speed, -DPS, but +14 agi instead of 11, idk ill figure it out and post, btw dont count on me buying it, the server vultures want like 200+G, lol, hate to be the guy shelling that cash out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this last night off alexi. it was my first time getting that far and I was hoping it would drop really bad. right after I got it I got a 1898 aimed shot crit.:D not bad for a BM hunter</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1st run, got it. No BS cap though :( A warrior overrolled me on it, though our loot master said a hunter needs it more, so I should get it.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Nov 19 15:00:41 2005</div>

Excellent first trip out with my new guild :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if a rougue rolled for this puppy with a hunter in the party then you would be just wasting it, bows are real;ly just for drawing people into rougues in PvE anyways</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this is Scholo last night. Man this is a COOL looking bow!<br /><br /> Got lucky as heck, too.<br /><br /> First run through it dropped and a bloody rogue outrolled me for it (me being the ONLY Hunter int he group).<br /><br /> Went right back in with another group and to my utter amazement it dropped again (this group gave it to me with zero probelms, cleared the instance WAY faster, too...we were done from the entrance to the final boss in less than 45 minutes and we even did the viewing room boss although I can't remember his name now).</div>

Never seen the damn bow drop before. I like it. Too bad we didn't have a hunter in that group. He could have taken the first one and I take the second one. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mungbeansss</b></h3>This bow is incredible for Hunters. Especially troll hunters. I think this bow might be BiS until Rhok'delar for troll hunters. The only bow that is a small upgrade is mandokir's sting. But even still you are only gaining 1 more damage with mandokirs sting and you're going to be more like to clip your auto autoshots with mandos sting whereas with this bow it is a little slower and more Hunter friendly. <br /><br />(edit) Hoodoo hunting bow is better than Mandokirs sting. It is a good upgrade for hunters before Rhok'delar if you currently have ancient bone bow. <br /><br />Any rogue or warrior that rolls on this against a hunter doesn't know anything about this game.</div>
