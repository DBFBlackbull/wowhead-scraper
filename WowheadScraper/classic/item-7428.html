I found a bunch of them in the hills East of Bhag'Thera, beyond the goblins' camp on the river, just North of the Ogre Mound.&nbsp; There are about six or seven panthers (lvl 38) with about fourteen tigresses (lvs 37 & 38). They respawn fairly quickly and the drop rate looks to be about 9-10%. Took me about 90 minutes with my 36 Hunter (Skinning 250) to get 8 skins. Oddly enough, the panthers only show up on the mini-map with Track Beasts on when they appear, so unfortunately that was no help in tracking them. Used Flare many times but never caught one that way either. The tigresses drop Tiger Meat and of course skins, so for a Hunter\/Skinner, this is an ideal assignment.&nbsp; One caution - not one of the Shadowcat Hides dropped; they were all skinned. Don't know if this would be true for non-skinners killing them. I have not seen these for sale in the AH (Earthen Ring) very often but that might change if I can get 7+ gold for a pair.\n\nSecond Edition: Following a suggestion above, I next went after the group near the beach just South of the Grom Gol Encampment, around Bangalash's hill. I am convinced the drop rate there is higher, even if that sounds crazy. I got 7 skins in an hour and they seemed to respawn much more quickly, to the point where they kept jumping me from behind while I was killing another or one of the Tigresses. Bangalash will normally ignore you but if he is pulled off his hill and you get in his aggro range, he will chase you forever. He killed my cat quickly and I finally had to swim away from the beach with about 11 health left. Tough guy.

My favorite farming spot is around the mountains near king bangalash. Farming these are really easy if you are a hunter like myself and use track hidden. The only mobs i know of that these drop off of are the lvl 38ish cats near king bangalash, the lvl 42ish cats by the gorillas in STV, and the cats in the far east of the swamp of sorrows. All of these mobs stealth, so it can be frustrating finding them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>remy</b></h3>I tried STV. I killed the elders for a bit, got about 2 in 15 minutes. I went to the regular Shadowmaw Panther ones since they were more of them. No shadowcat hides in about 25 kills. Went back to the Elders and got about 3 more in 10 minutes. <br /><br />I suggest going with the drop rates and try the elders first. There's actually an empty wide field of them above Spirit den, as you can see on the map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>34485</b></h3>I got the about every 3-5time i skinned Normal shadowman panthers<br />If you are a hunter useTrack Hidden like i discovered the hard way ;P Killed 10 and i got 2 while doing quest so dunno if it was due to the fact that while questing drop rate is increased</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bojo</b></h3>shadow cat hides are gained through skinning elder , and and are used for and (eatherworking)<br /><br />ppl say &quot;i got that many there on X minutes&quot; and stuff, but it depends on spec, class and lvl of your character. For example, a 60 fury warrior farms these faster than a 40 holy priest. Therefore you have to mention the number of mobs you killed, not the number of minutes you went farming.<br /><br />Myself, I am lvl 41 shadow priest. I killed around 30 - 35 and got 9 shadowcat hides.<br /><br />The level also determine how easy you see the cats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does it come from skinning or loot?&nbsp; I have killed and skinned about 40 of the shawdow panthers from the Swamp of Sorrows and I have not gotten one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You get these by skinning the shadow cat. I have killed at least 30 and have skinned for 1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I spent 2-3 hours farming Shadowcat Hides, the best place to do it is in the little vale with Elder Shadowmaw Panthers, as they are the only spawns there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a 56 Shaman with over 400 gold. I ow my fortune to these little kitties.<br />I got the pattern from booty bay from the leather worker in the room with the other 2 goblins. I've bought this pattern about 10 times and always sell it on the AH for at least 4 times what I paid. On my server (Gorgonash) I can sell these gloves without fail at a buyout of 18-19G.<br />I can farm it really easily but these days I just buy it off noobs who put it on the AH for about 25-50s a piece. I'l pay just over 1G per piece at max.<br />Long story short. Get the pattern, farm and buy the hide, make the gloves, put on AH for 16 bid 19 buyout. (never put more than one pair on at once, they won't look as rare)<br />If your a merchant like me. You'l tell them in trade a few times.<br />&quot;You never see +crit gear this low lvl on AH. Perfect for alts!&quot;<br />Don't get frustrated when the hide does'nt drop. %10 chance means you will often go 20-30 with nothing, but just as often you'l get 2-3 in a row :)<br />Happy hunting;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I understand its a hastle to farm these and much easier to just follow the crowd and just say &quot;screw it&quot; but seriously I've sold 3pairs of them within the past week and a half and made 10g for each...Maybe it is a server problem but all you have to do is keep on working on making them and trying to sell them, if not anything else you get the leatherworking experience for it...but thats completely your choice, I respect that but good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I realized that since I was leveling and the shadowmaw panthers werent, that I moved onto the Elder Shadowmaw Panthers...their drop rate for shadowcat hide is much better than the lower level ones...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive been grinding these to make the ShadowSkin gloves, selling one pair every day for some time now. Some days it only takes half an hour to get eight of them, and some days it can take up to two hours. However, I sell these for 17-19G on my server, so its worth the hassle :) <br /><br />Oh, by the way. The poster above me is right, the droprate for the Elder SM-Panthers is way better than the &quot;normal&quot; ones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So far, this has been my #1 income source for buying a mount. Stared in AH at 5g and buyout for 25g. In less then 5 hours, they were gone at buyout price. Good stuff!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These are great gloves but farming the Panthers takes awhile. I found a bunch of them in the hills East of Bhag'Thera, beyond the goblins' camp on the river, just North of the Ogre Mound.&nbsp; There are about six or seven panthers (lvl 38) with about fourteen tigresses (lvs 37 &amp; 38). They respawn fairly quickly and the drop rate looks to be about 9-10%. Took me about 90 minutes with my 36 Hunter (Skinning 250) to get 8 skins. Oddly enough, the panthers only show up on the mini-map with Track Beasts on when they appear, so unfortunately that was no help in tracking them. Used Flare many times but never caught one that way either. The tigresses drop Tiger Meat and of course skins, so for a Hunter/Skinner, this is an ideal assignment.&nbsp; One caution - not one of the Shadowcat Hides dropped; they were all skinned. Don't know if this would be true for non-skinners killing them. I have not seen these for sale in the AH (Earthen Ring) very often but that might change if I can get 7+ gold for a pair.<br /><br />Second Edition: Following a suggestion above, I next went after the group near the beach just South of the Grom Gol Encampment, around Bangalash's hill. I am convinced the drop rate there is higher, even if that sounds crazy. I got 7 skins in an hour and they seemed to respawn much more quickly, to the point where they kept jumping me from behind while I was killing another or one of the Tigresses. Bangalash will normally ignore you but if he is pulled off his hill and you get in his aggro range, he will chase you forever. He killed my cat quickly and I finally had to swim away from the beach with about 11 health left. Tough guy. I plan to make him into a bathroom rug.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>154 kills of the 37 &amp; 38 shadowcats, 19 shadowcat hides skinned.&nbsp; That's a 12.3% drop rate, and close enough to the 11.8 &amp; 11.3 rates listed.<br /><br />As to the folks who say the elder cats drop hides faster, I can look up and see that there are nearly 6000 kills that say you're wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>U gotta skin for these?<br /><br />Edited, Sun Mar 12 23:04:17 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>------------------------<br /> Date ( April 1st 07 )<br />_________________________<br /><br />Okay i was farming these last night on my 36 combat rogue for the hides, this 53 hunter was farming allies around so he decided to help me. This was in STV btw. We killed about 40 normal shadowmaw panthers i got about... 10 hides? I got really lucky. We then moved onto the elder shadowmaws which i could not solo ( the normal ones took me almost no effort to kill) . So anyways we mustve killed like 50 of these things in 15-20 minutes or so and i didnt get ONE hide! wtf? anyways i sold the gloves for 120g on AH lol i meant to put em up for 12g but accidently did it for 120g so i guess someone thot it was a twink item since it was the only one on the AH so .... 45minutes of farming or so and i made 120g. =D im lvl 36 with no alts and ive alrdy got my normal and epic mounts and 300 skinning/300 LW. woot im so good at this game lol....too bad i rolled a Blood Elf for a rogue eh? I just wanted a Blood Elf lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have only killed a dozen er so of these and I have 4 hides, so the drop % must be seperate than the skinning %, if so; what is the sinning %?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I killed about 20 Shadowmaw Panthers for 8x Shadowcat Hides - the Hides were needed to Shadowskin Gloves</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Somebody was saying you can find 'em in the Swamp of Sorrows.. anyone know if this is true?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Nevermind..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Per the 1.9 patch notes, shadowcat hide will now drop more frequently. <br /><br />Unfortunately for leatherworkers, this means more of the gloves will be on the auction house. I already had a hard time selling for some reason. It's a very good armor for any rogue or feral druid kit for a long while.<br /><br />edit: after the patch has been out for two days now I've seen a slight increase in Shadowcat Hide on the AH. I have not personally tested the drop rates yet.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jan 5 07:59:06 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I spent about 2 hours one morning, killed about 20-30 shadow maws all over STV and only got 2 hides...seemed pointless 1 x Hide per hour :S ..well its good for leather i supposse if you have nothing better to do :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow! there's a really big difference on what kind of cats you are farming for the hides.. some have drop rates as low as 1/2% and as high as 10%.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7284/red-whelp-gloves"></a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What should I ask for a stack of 5 cause 75s seems to me a little to cheap for something thats so hard to get?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These are a pain in the butt to skin. They seem to drop the most from the elder shadowmaw panthers in STV by the Arena. I started skinning them around lvl 40 (skinning around 285) I still go there at lvl 50 (skinning at 300)and the skin drop doesn't get any better. =P I make Shadowskin Gloves often because they always sell right away on the AH.<br />Sometimes you can find the hides for a great price at the AH. Grab em when you can! Or spend countless hours being mauled by the big black sneaky kittys =).<br /><br />There was one time I went to collect the hides and got lucky. Spent about an hour and got 10 hides. That was a one time thing though.<br /><br />And yes! There are Shadow Panthers in Swamp Of Sorrows. There aren't very many but they are there. Never got a shadowcat hide from them though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>sux.....got one in the time it took me to loot 3<br />with a 225 skill anyway :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kittenbisk12</b></h3>Lvl 57 hunter; was after these hides and it took me 32 until I got one. After that it was almost like one dropped every other two cats! Don't be discouraged!</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
