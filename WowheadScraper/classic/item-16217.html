<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to him and a first NO RECIPE at all, not even a red item on a timer or anything.&nbsp; I stood at him for about 20 mins and it just appeared.<br /><br />So if you go to get and its not there just camp him a hwile it shoudl show up eventually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Mythrin 'dir is in Darnassus /tloc 61,18<br /><br />But he didn't have the formula when I was there.<br /><br />I'll try again a bit later...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You got to be patient on this one! ;-)<br /><br />I logged out for 45 minutes standing next to him. After re-connect the formula was there.<br /><br />It is indeed soulbound.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found him idd in Darnassus on 61,18 .. he got the formula too :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Daniel Bartlett in Undercity does indeed sell this BoP formula.&nbsp; I found it on a Wednesday morning.&nbsp; <br /><br />I checked him frequently without success prior.&nbsp; I am wondering if the formula restocks with server reset.&nbsp; Either that, or it is a very long restock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>Darnassus 60.17<br />It is BOP and limited supply (1)</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive been standing next to the guy in darn for bout 1hr now. is there any lvl or rpe u hav to be with darn befor u can buy it ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's limited supply(1), once some one buys it, it's on a cool down (I think like 6 hours) and once the cool down is up the vendor will have another one available.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been there many times to buy the other formula with 3+ defence to bracers. The formula for 7 + stamina on shield is there every time. I tried in the morning, middle of the day and even at night. Maybe it's easier for alliance because no one want to travel all the way to Darnassus ;) I don't know :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this recipe has a spawn time of about 20 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got to the vendor in darnassus, and he had the +3 defence to bracers instand of the +7 Stamina to shield.. but since i didnt have it yet, i bought it. 30 secons later, another +3 defence pops up (so much for limited supply). Curious, i bought that one too.. and sure enough, 30 seconds later the +7 Stamina comes up. Lucky... or coincidence.... probebly lucky :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Mythrin'dir still sells it. I picked it up five minutes ago. I waited for around an hour. It was the <b>last</b> item on his list. <br /><br />+5 def and (jewlcrafting) are the <b>first</b> two limited supply items on his list. I didn't have to buy any of the other limited supply enchants to make the shield enchant spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>rly hate this cause I waited for like 3 hours and then lvl 35 came and bought it and said he's gonna get a lot of money for it on AH ^^ like it wasn't BoP</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Found it at 5:12pm, so it's not on the even half-hours (2:30, 4:30, ...12:30).<br /><br />Bought the bracer enchant just before 5pm and it respawned moments later (about 5pm) but not with the shield enchant. So either they aren't linked, or buying the bracer enchant triggers a delayed release of the shield enchant.<br /><br />Good luck..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>hehe I checked with my shaman for the formula, it wasnt there. I thought maybe you need to be honored with UC so I checked with my mage. Its was there relogged to my shaman and it was still there. <br />So it was just luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hello..<br /><br />Appeared for me at half past midnight. I also bought the bracer enchantment from him just before just to see if that had any impact, so it's either that it was half past midnight or that i bought that bracer enchant or a combo of both.<br /><br />Hope this helps..<br /><br />------<br /><br />Dzalandar<br />Lvl 65 Warlock - Alliance<br />Alonsus Realm</div>
