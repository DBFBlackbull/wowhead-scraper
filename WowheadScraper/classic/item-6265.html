<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8506</b></h3>Soul Shards are bop. They are used for many things like summoning warlock pets like the void walker, felhunter, succubus, and felguard. Soul Shards are also used in making health stones and spell stones and fire stones. Ritual of summoning also uses a soul shard along with soul stone. Some other spells that use a soul shard are shadow burn and soul fire.<br /><br />Soul Shards can only be recived by using drain soul on a enemy and will only be given if the enemy dies while you are channeling drain soul. Most warlocks use rank 1 of drain soul due to the mana cost of the highest rank of drain soul. Also in order to recive a soul shard the enemy has to be able to give you honor, rep, or exp.<br /><br />Soul Shards are a import part in a warlocks life so keep many on hand and try to gather them when possible.</div>
