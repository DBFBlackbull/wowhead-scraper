<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I Got this pattern on the first try, this was early early in tghe morning. <br /><br />Jumped into water in BB, swim around the BB and up on the beach where the vendor is. <br /><br />Im a priest, so I turned on Shield and buffed me up. ran into the crowd and pressed &quot;fear&quot; looted the vendor and died..<br /><br />Simple =)&nbsp; did this in lvl 35 i think.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Pattern wasn't there when I tried a few minutes ago. I guess I'll try again later. <br />I've been farming Long Elegant Feathers from hippographs for a few hours, I have enough for 4 hats now. <br /><br />It's not really necessary to kill the mobs around him, you can just walk to him from behind, buy the pattern and run like crazy. At least I (47 warlock) could. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im lvl 46 rogue and-as im looking to have a complete, cool pirate getup- i've looked for the admiral's hat on the AH and asked tailors for it but found nothing. i was finishing up some quests south of BB and decided to see what this &quot;coward&quot; guy was selling (note... whenever you see a vendor in an unexpected place check out what they've got... they usually have something random of value) i killed all the guys around him and checked out what he had, and to my great suprise he had the pattern for the admirals hat. i guess not that many people farm it on a sunday at 11:00pm.&nbsp; I had given up on finding this item at all actually. now i just need a tailor to give this pattern to so that i can have the hat...<br /><br />if anyone knows of more items to make a cool pirate getup please let me know. im always on the lookout. <br /><br />Gwyndalyn on Detheroc server.<br /><br />PS: for those that dont have coords--- just walk out of BB heading north and turn right out of the tunnel, then walk straight to the beach then head south. youll see one lone tent with some warlocks, keep going and then youll see three tents and a bonfire. standing by the table is the vendor.<br /><br />good luck guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to get recipe for mechanical dragonling then back to get the recips for admirals cap then back to the dragonling guy and ran around for awhile then got another hat recipe hehe</div>
