<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You need a quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had the quest. I relogged a few times and they started working again</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just one comment that others seem not to have highlighted - follow the lava rivers.&nbsp; You can find usually 3 or 4 piles in a row along the rivers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I found some piles I couldn't loot too ... don't know why.&nbsp; There seems to be one pile at the top of the mountain that I couldn't mouse over ... maybe there are 2 kinds of piles?&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These can be found in <b>Burning Steppes</b> along the lava rivers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For the Tier 0,5 quest you should not look for the &quot;pillars&quot; around Dreadmaul rock. Look for the flatter, brown piles around the lava rivers. Go get'em!<br /><br />Update: OMG this part of the quest was easy. Gathered all 25 ashes in less than 10 minutes, took 95 points of damage from an upset elemental before I banished him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>East of BRM, 10 minute job.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Volcanic ashes are in the northern middle part of burning stepps. They look like HUGE piles of dark gray dirt. I keep finding them near (what i call) &quot;lava puddles&quot;. Most of the time there is around 3 in one pile and 2 per &quot;lava puddle&quot;. There mostly is about 1 lvl 53-56 elemental in the &quot;lava puddle&quot;s. Some are near the mountains you'll find.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took me 8 minutes to collect 20 of these in the Burning Steppes.&nbsp; Just go in or around any of the red lava spots on the map and you cant go wrong.<br /><br />However, as soon as i collected 20, i couldnt collect anymore.&nbsp; I opened a ticket, with no response from support.<br /><br />It is very easy though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There's a Large strand that has Volcanic Ash every few feet until the strand ends. Makes for a quick pick and go. Coords are 53,41 to 42,43(roughly). This strand makes Collection a Breeze.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well i checked out the coords before, checked out near the entrance to MC. I havent found one of these piles. I know they exist because i saw my buddy pick some up a couple weeks ago. Spend about 2 hours looking and gave up. Did they stop spawning or something?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i couldnt loot these until i left my raid group for UBRS. They reinvited me about 3 times to see if putting the loot on ffa would work but it didnt but it was down to the fact i was in a group. Maybe thats why some of you can't loot them. I also heard that someone got stuck at 20... Maybe you were in a group at thjat time? :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Simply Put: if your looking for this item: it is EASIEST to be farmed at 41, 44 and near surroundings. Picked up all 25 here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of Jan. 11, the inability to loot the volcanic ash is a known issue per a discussion with a GM. Someone on another board mentioned that you have to have at least the gloves if not the gloves and belt to be able to loot the ash. My druid didn't have the gloves, but was able to loot 6 before it stopped working, so who knows. Hope that helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You don't need the gloves in order to pickup the ash.<br />I don't know what you guys did wrong but I did the bracers quest first, don't know if that matters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>found some at 71, 26 Searing gorge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are Ash Piles around Ruins of Thaurissan on Burning Steppes (brown piles at the edge of the lava), loot ash from them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This Quest is Exspansif</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What is agro?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Like people have said, it's on the lava paths in Burning Steppes.<br /><br />I found the one with the most volcanic ash, literally piles in a row, was the ash 'line' that starts at 41, 43 and goes to 53, 41. I reccomend that one.<br /><br />Shouldn't take more than 5 minutes or so to get the ash.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i don't have the gloves, but i completed it no problems.<br /><br />You only need to have the quest called The Ectoplasmic Distiller, <br />only if you have the quest where stands you require volcanic ash: 0/25 you can pick it up, make sure your not in raid either while trying to loot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fiery pit + Agro = Ash. Pretty simple equasion, just takes a while if the area is camped. Drive that mount around the map for a while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ground spawn around Dreadmaul Rock, no killing required.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have finished the Bracer quest. I have the Ectoplasmic Distiller quest in my log. I can see the ash piles on the ground in Burning Steppes but I cannot pick them up. No 'gear' mouse icon. I have killed hundreds of the little flame guys in the fire pits and never had an ash drop.<br /><br />Do I need to get the other ingredients first or what?<br /><br />update: I've read all I can find on this quest and the only explanation I can come up with is that it won't let me loot them because I don't have the tier 0 gloves. I have the other 7 but no gloves. Since this is a quest to upgrade the gloves I guess you must have them to loot. Best theory I can come up with.<br /><br />I guess it's back to 5-man BRD Emperor. Joy...<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 6 11:37:25 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>u can pick up the volcanic ash in the lava flows throughout burning steps alot easier then waiting for drops of it\</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kub0ss</b></h3>Only lootable if you're on the quest, otherwise you can still see them on the ground but can't loot.<br />Each mound is lootable only once then despawns, drop quantity seems to be random 1-3 ashes.<br />I looted all of mine around 44.50 43.50 there's a lot of them around there.<br /><br /><b>TomTom:</b><br />/way Burning Steppes 44.50 43.50 &quot;Volcanic Ash mounds&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Buklau</b></h3>Will these be used after this quest ever again?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AtieshFearless</b></h3>Can confirm that being in a raid group prevents interaction with the Ash piles. I left my raid group and things instantly worked as expected, i'm not sure if a normal 5-man group has the same effect. I'm confident the bug has nothing to do with carrying the Gloves, as some other comments suggested.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chargento</b></h3>All comments are practically useless for anyone looking for Volcanic Ash. To be able to interact with the piles of ash, all you need is the quest The Ectoplasmic Distiller.</div>
