Then I went to the helipad by Cragpool Lake and the prints dropped off the second operator I killed there.<br /><br />NOTE: Watch out for Foreman Rigger (24+) if you aren't strong enough to tackle him yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took about 20 operators for this to drop for me. <br />Camped SE corner of Cragpool Lake, where the Helipad is. 3 operators there, and if it starts looking grim, you can run into the lake to lose threat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thaag</b></h3>Don't forget that the mobs which drop this item are not just on the big giant machine. Some are securing guylines nearby and some are near the sawmill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dewmguy</b></h3>This drop rate is a joke. I don't know why Wowhead says 29%, that is an outright fabrication. Four clears of the Operators on the machine and near the logging building and it still hasn't dropped (at least 24).</div>
