Thats an average of 33 obviously.\nso with the same math i took 110 dmg per second. thats 440 total\nso the percentage of dmg i took was 440\/807 = 54.5%\n\nTrial 3: (sucky dmg)\nThe deathray hit the mob for 799\nFelhuner takes 33 dmg per second again.\nso the percentage fo dmg i took was 440\/799 = 55.1\n\nTrial 4: (good dmg)\nThe deathray hit the mob for 1043 dmg\nfelhunter took 43 per second\ni took 573 total\n573\/1043 = 54.9\n\nTrial 5(decent dmg)\ndeathray hits for  997\npet takes 41 dmg per second.\nI take 547 dmg.\n547\/997 = 54.8\n\nIn conclusion the range of the deathray is from mid 700s to mid 1000s.\nIf it crits it is double dmg.

Exceptions r if ur a pally and throw up that stupid bubble. or if u r a priest and have ur shield absorb. or if ur soul link.\n\nBeing soul link is good cuz the pet mitigates the dmg and with melee hitting u and u waiting for ur dots to kill the person u can charge this baby up. also good to cast when multiple ppl r hitting u.

My rogue is 3-shot-killing people my lvl with this. Ambush with crit talent+backstap with crit talen+death ray, those 3 hits kill almost everyone, 100%hp, 0%hp, dead hordie. For those new to the Death Ray, I will explain its effects.\n\nWhen you cast this, it will drain you for 5 seconds, in which it will do about 70% of its to be target damage, to yourself. If you want to know how much its going to hit for, while charging, multiple whatever its hitting you for each second, by 7. If its hitting you for 100 each second, then its going to nuke 700. If its hitting you for 200, its going to nuke 1400. This is before criticals, if its hitting you for 100, and crits, then its 1400, naturally. Crit does twice as much. The Death Ray used to do much less, but now it ussualy nukes around 700-1000 damage. Rarely, but sometimes it can nuke 1000-1500. Anytime it Crits, it will do twice as much. Just make sure you have enough hp, to take the charge damage. One time I had 1100hp left on me, charged death ray, and it killed me by eating 241 each second.(1687 nuke charging) It does about 70% of its nuke damage, to you while charging, if you don't have the hp to pay for it, it WILL kill you. Not very handly when your hp is running low, as the charge damage will just finish you off, but in short term fights, pvp, and especially when you have a healer, its a very good trade off. On a side note, if the Death Ray kills you while charging, you will not take gear dmg.\n\nDeath Ray is a 1 shot killer in pvp, when someone snares you\/roots you\/etc, then trys to run away with low health. Instead of trying to chase, charge up death ray, and give them a lightning bolt. Also, if you see players fighting with 10-40%health left, charge up Death Ray and its ussualy enough to kill them off just like that. The damage it does to you, doesn't amount to much when they died first.:)\n\nIt will still be usefull at 60 as well, since any 60mage\/warlock nukes an average of 400-600, while this device nukes 700 at the very least.

I've done plenty of PVP and this trinket was underwhelming every time. Long chargeup, significant health cost for mediocre damage. \n\nIt may be good for some classes, but at least for mages the trinket is useless. A fireball or a frostbolt usually hits about the same or harder, casts much faster, doesn't require you to have a trinket equipped, and doesn't force you to sacrifice tons of HP.\n\nAnd you can't cheat this trinket out since it has a lengthy 4 second cast time, so for mages it's just kind of permanently useless. I would assume this is 100% as true for warlocks.\n\nSame goes for battle chicken, it's unreliable and as a mage, well the melee haste doesn't do anything for you. The chicken will also refuse to run towards the enemy or follow you unless you summon it pointblank. Meaning you can't summon the battle chicken out before the fight and swap trinkets - it will just remain uselessly in a spot. And thus you'd rather have an actual damage trinket equipped... I think this remains true even for melees. Since when they go melee, they'll be in combat, and thus battle chicken is not really swappable out while providing benefits, and not nearly as useful as a hand of justice or something.\n\nThere just isn't any reason(for a caster, at least) to be a gnomish engineer, even if you plan to switch over to goblin afterwards by re-leveling engineering and keeping items. You'll be 100% as well off just levelling goblin engineer for the sick items and easy consumables, and buy the useful gnomish items from a gnomish engineer or AH.","date":"2020-06-13T01:56:19-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2020-06-13T02:04:55-05:00",5,"SeekerWi"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":91,"id":5343151,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Raithek","body":"Here is a Rogue abusing the trinket in classic, still seems to be quite op.\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/l3OAi_L8Pko","date":"2022-03-20T10:20:13-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}}];

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arador</b></h3>Note that this doesn't require Engineering skill to use - so you could skill up Engineering high enough to make it, and then drop Engineering and still keep using this trinket.<br /><br />There are theories though that suggest that the damage scales with your engineering skill, so dropping Engineering might be a bad idea.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4956</b></h3>This item drains your life and directly converts it into damage. I've seen it crit for 7k+ there are screenshots of 9k+.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8202</b></h3>This item is amazing if used in a level 10-19 WSG. How you may say can you use this in that level of BG??? First be a Gnome, preferably warrior or rogue, and level to 19. As you level take and raise engineering, even using higher leveled characters to buy the supplies needed. A gnome with is full engineering at level 19 should have just enough points to use one of these babies. It can deal 1000 damage sometimes which is enough to kill even the strongest enemies at that level, but can backfire and deal around 500 to you, that's why you should be a warrior or rogue. Good luck making one and while you're at it if you twink your guy as well you will be close to invincible in a 10-19 WSG. Have fun!!!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8242</b></h3>This is amazing and its one of the coolest in my opinion (besides the scuba helment!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Carighan</b></h3>Sadly this was changed to be a lot lower in damage than before. Both in the damage it deals to the enemy, and in the feedback damage you get during the charge-up time.<br /><br />As someone already said, the damage you take while charging predicts how much the enemy will take. If it's 230+, expect a crit for 2k+.<br /><br />Still, there should be a post-60 version, maybe the Death Ray MkII. This trinket is godlike (and pretty risky with the then-hug feedback damage) when you first get it, but at lvl60 relatively unimpressive.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>radeox</b></h3>This is seriously one of the best PvP trinkets ever. Only 5 minutes cooldown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It hurts you over time while you prepare it and then does a lot of dmg to the enemy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got this thing over the weekend and I couldn't be happier. <br /><br />You gain access to the schematic through the gnome engineer in booty bay.&nbsp; All you need to have is your gnome engineer membership and 240 engineering. (Thank you mithril frag bombs for those last 5 eng points)<br /><br />I basically bought the ichor of undead and essence of undead at the AH for about 2 gold total. The rest of the stuff I already had.<br /><br />What I've found is that it does about 500-600 damage to you when you click to fire. (about 200 per tick over 3 ticks) <br /><br />It has a 30 yard range, and if your target moves outside that range it won't fire.<br /><br />It's a trinket, but it's on a separate cooldown timer from your other trinkets.&nbsp; 10 min cooldown.<br /><br />On average it seems to do around 700-800 damage on non-crits.<br /><br />One of the best things I've found is it doesn't appear to be resistable.&nbsp; I've used it to shoot down a level 60 paladin at level 41.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>From what I've seen this is one of the best items you can in late game (any engineers how are wondering pick gnome engineering the use of death ray/shrink ray has alowed my warrior to semi-own alot rouges and pallies in pvp and the 500 dmg protection belt comes in handy)I've used it scores of times and it has never broken.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>K this is the most recent test of it so far- after the patch.<br /><br />First off, it still does NOT require eng. to use, only to be made.<br /><br />Therefore, it is possible to lvl up eng. to 240, make the device, then toss eng. and still use this. (I wouldnt reccommend that, though).<br /><br />This has got to be my favorite little trinket-<br /><br />I made this at lvl 37 (i was maxed out eng. all the way to lvl 30ish but it is so expensive!)<br />...first off, it does NOT always hit you when<br />charging....its rather odd, but so far its hit me about 60% of the time charging.<br /><br />now, for the damage....AMAZING...<br /><br />I was in BG and hit a lvl 39 paladin for 2ksomething, killing him in 1 hit...he had no idea what happened...then i sapped a lvl ? NE druid outside of hammerfall after AB and got a&nbsp; 1.4k hit off on him (before he and his ? warlock buddy disposed of me)...it seems that resists for this are very rare, because i have dueled many lvl 60s with it and have yet to see it resisted.<br /><br />its devastating pvp power is matched by its astounding pve power-<br /><br />Running instances with this can make life so much easier, if you take the first shot on a boss and instruct the preist ahead of time to immeddiately heal you.<br /><br />been using this 2 days, (1 day, really).<br /><br />highest hit- 2k something on Herod<br />lowest hit- 800 something on a lvl 41 mage :(<br /><br />average for ALL the hits: about 1200ish with a few lucky 1.7k and 1.8k's taking out mid-lvl alliance pretty handily.<br /><br />NO crits so far...im scared at what this is capable of<br /><br />hope this was helpful,<br />FOR THE HORDE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This thing actually rules the world ,)<br />As i tested, it has two ways - it can deal simple hit (~1000) or double hit (~2000), and crit (~1900) and double crit (~4000+). <br /><br />The point is - actually, it has a simple random link between dmg on caster and dmg on victim..<br />FE, it have drained 152*4 from me and then done a 2000-simple non-crit on enemy. Other time, it drained 254*4 from me and dealed 1000 non-crit. So,if it drains more you can expect a higher hit but it's not 100%. <br /><br />I've obtained it on lvl 36 though.. The main advantage that you get is that no one expecting that you can just take 50% from his life or even 1-shot-kill him. In duels, people just becomes entrapped by my frost trap, i come closer and then it's a mortal 2000 shot.. They just say WTF. Pretty, pretty thing, you just need to have enough health to take possibly 1000 extra dmg.. I laughed a lot on crappy pals, when they just wait until their hp get low to use shield.. Moderate damage caused on 50% of their hp makes them dead.<br /><br />The other plus is that channeling can only be interrupted, but not prolonged or something else. If you won't receive rogue kick or shammy shock or smthng like this, it WILL hit in 4 seconds properly, and it WILL hit with a full damage.<br /><br />Combined with Gnomish Net-o-Matic Projector, it's perfect on melee classes.. And it seems to be shadow damage or smthng, priests and warlocks can absorb nearly 1/3 of all damage caused as i tested it in duels. No other classes did it..<br /><br />Finaly, it's true - this crap cannot miss or be deflected! It's the best thing ever, if used properly, it can kill you, but it can 1-shot-kill a 60th lvl char so remember it..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here's some tips I've learned from my new death ray:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Cooldown - 5mins, 4sec channeled spellcast<br />2)&nbsp; Cancelling it resets it's cooldown.&nbsp; Use it when you know you can pull it off.<br />3)&nbsp; Always have over 1.5k hp when firing.&nbsp; There's a chance you could kill yourself with low HP.<br />4)&nbsp; The more it hurts you in the wind-up, the more it's going to hurt your enemy.<br />5)&nbsp; It's channeled but doesnt seem to be interrupted by getting hit.&nbsp; It will get interrupted from shield bash/silence, and then reset the cooldown.<br />6)&nbsp; Shares Cooldown with bombs.&nbsp; Don't throw a bomb right before you wanna use death ray.<br />7)&nbsp; Net-o-matic and this is a wonderful combo.<br />8)&nbsp; In PvE, if trying to death ray an untapped target, the mob will aggro as soon as you start channeling.<br />9)&nbsp; In PvE, it seems like this creates VERY LITTLE hate for how much damage it does<br />10) In PvE, be extra careful about your HP when firing.&nbsp; It can potentially hurt you for 1.2k.<br />11) In PvE and PvP, if a mob is &quot;Immune&quot;&nbsp; (Like a pally bubble/banish/etc) the mob must get out of his bubble before you start channeling.&nbsp; If you fire it while he's immune, it will just say &quot;Immune&quot; and reset cooldown.&nbsp; So don't try to time it out so as soon as his bubble goes down he gets zapped, gotta wait until it goes down.<br />12) As a warrior, the best way to use it pvp I've found is to charge in, bloodrage, intimidating shout everything else away, then zap, then play cleanup on whatever is left.<br /><br />So far my records a 4216 crit&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Herod never saw it comin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Death Ray = 5 minute cooldown<br />Pally Bubble = 5 minute cooldown<br /><br />Coincidence?&nbsp; I think not.<br /><br />I made this trinket today at level 40, and so far it is simply amazing.&nbsp; The tactic I have devised is this:<br /><br />Bubble<br />Hammer of Justice so that they don't run around or out of range.<br />Death Ray<br />/flex at their corpse<br /><br />Pally bubble completely absorbs any damage that the death ray would normally cause you, but does not in any way diminish the amount of pain that it administers to the poor bastard on the receiving end.&nbsp; So far, it always deals at least 700 damage, usually closer to 900, and my record crit for today is 2.2k on some 60 warlock that thought my friend and I would be an easy gank.<br /><br />Also, there seems to be some confusion about how to learn the pattern.&nbsp; I did this today, so I am absolutely sure of this information:<br /><br />For alliance, the trainer who teaches you death ray, along with gnomish engineering and all the other gnomish recopes, is in Ironforge - NOT bootybay.&nbsp; He is standing in the tinker area, where the gnome king, the tram entrance, and all the other engineering trainers are.&nbsp; The trainer is standing right in front of the throne, to the gnome king's right.<br /><br />Horde go to either BB or ratchet.&nbsp; I cannot remember exactly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Howdy. Im a 35 paladin, and im developing a god complex. I havent lost a single duel to anyone my level in months. I tap divine shield, death ray, then, they just die. <br />The earliest you can get this baby is at level 20 if your a gnome, or level 35 if your anyone else. <br />I wouldent really suggest gettin it as a level 20 gnome though, because to be honest ittl proly just destroy your health along with the targets.<br /><br />This ray is best for paladins because our bubbles allow us to cast it without taking damage, and because we dont have very many ranged attacks, so this fills a giant hole.<br />The lowest hit I have done is about 400. The highest normal hit i have done is 2027. The highest crit ive done was 4152. Boy that cow had it comin too :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I made a test with Death Ray on a mage at the same lvl as me ( lvl 43 ) and I'm a Paladin Holy Specc with about 500 atk power.<br /><br />I made 3 test with all armor on both and no buffs. On a calculator is showed about the damage I received and how it affected the target. <br />It's simple the damage you receive x 1.75 on the target. And also tried with the target with no armor (no extra stats, armor etc.) and it was the same, 1.75 extra. I even tried myself with no armorin 6 attemps. I received two crits with that and it made my damage lost x 3.5 (the double) and I also received two of thoose &quot;extra hp drained&quot; that drains about 1k hp and hurted x 1.75 more. So if you loose more hp then unsual you probably still will receive x 1.75 dmg on the target.<br />The point that I critted twice with no armor and I received that extra dmg too can mean that you get more with no armor? Well it's no garantue, but at least I did.<br />I'm pretty sure it does not drain a percent of your hp since it almost killed me when I had no armor and would not if my armor was on. The fact how much hp you lost is what I guess random. But it seems I've hurted more on high lvl mobs and players.<br /><br />If you were going to create a calculate addon for death ray I should suggest that the addanon should&nbsp; get started when you receive the first dmg of the death ray. The addon could then take that damage x (4 x 1.75) and count out a pretty precise dmg on how much it will injury the enemy and you could always take the calculated dmg x 2 too know how much it would dmg on a critt. Hope this info were for any help ! I'm also exited to fully understand how to improve the Death Ray.<br /><br />Calculation:<br />The dmg you receive my Death Ray x 1.75 on target or x 3.5 if it Critts.</div>

The belt also means you are almost invincible against attack while you load the death ray. Although your invincible(ish) it doesn't defend you against those annoying spells that send you running around uncontrollably.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>&quot;This seems to imply that you know what the gun is going to hit for, 7 seconds in advance! <br />If you take around 25 damage/second, you're going to hit for the minimum.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i tested the exact numbers by seeing how my much my pet absorbed since im soul link. I did a few trials and here were the results...<br /><br />Trial 1: (this was my biggest hit since i made this trinket)<br />The deathray hit the mob for 1851.<br />Felhunter takes 77,76,76,77 dmg. thats an average of 76.5 dmg per second <br />so if (dmg done to me per second if i wasnt soul link) X 0.3 = 76.5 then x = 255 dmg per second!<br />So since its a 4 second charge 255 X 4 = 1020<br /><br />So the percentage of dmg i took was 1020/1851 = 0.551 which is bout 55%<br /><br />Trial 2: (sucky dmg)<br />The deathray hit the mob for 807.<br />Felhunter takes 33,33,33,33 dmg. Thats an average of 33 obviously.<br />so with the same math i took 110 dmg per second. thats 440 total<br />so the percentage of dmg i took was 440/807 = 54.5%<br /><br />Trial 3: (sucky dmg)<br />The deathray hit the mob for 799<br />Felhuner takes 33 dmg per second again.<br />so the percentage fo dmg i took was 440/799 = 55.1<br /><br />Trial 4: (good dmg)<br />The deathray hit the mob for 1043 dmg<br />felhunter took 43 per second<br />i took 573 total<br />573/1043 = 54.9<br /><br />Trial 5(decent dmg)<br />deathray hits for 997<br />pet takes 41 dmg per second.<br />I take 547 dmg.<br />547/997 = 54.8<br /><br />In conclusion the range of the deathray is from mid 700s to mid 1000s.<br />If it crits it is double dmg. But u also take double the dmg since its a percentage of the dmg done. Overall u r prettty much gonna lose 55% of the u do to ur own hp give or take a percent or so. So dont use it if ur almost dead. Exceptions r if ur a pally and throw up that stupid bubble. or if u r a priest and have ur shield absorb. or if ur soul link.<br /><br />Being soul link is good cuz the pet mitigates the dmg and with melee hitting u and u waiting for ur dots to kill the person u can charge this baby up. also good to cast when multiple ppl r hitting u. This is also good for a hunter when ppl r in his dead zone (mage resto druid). ALso good for rogues after they gouge since they r waiting for energy regen they can just use the trinket in the meantime hten follow wiht other crap.<br /><br />So teh question is can u sacrifice that much hp and 4 seconds of ur time to shoot this off. Remember counter spell kick pummmel earthshock do not stop the cast time or prevent it from casting. Only stuns/disorients screw the cast up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Death ray is an amazing trinket, in pve or pvp. My rogue is 3-shot-killing people my lvl with this. Ambush with crit talent+backstap with crit talen+death ray, those 3 hits kill almost everyone, 100%hp, 0%hp, dead hordie. For those new to the Death Ray, I will explain its effects.<br /><br />When you cast this, it will drain you for 5 seconds, in which it will do about 70% of its to be target damage, to yourself. If you want to know how much its going to hit for, while charging, multiple whatever its hitting you for each second, by 7. If its hitting you for 100 each second, then its going to nuke 700. If its hitting you for 200, its going to nuke 1400. This is before criticals, if its hitting you for 100, and crits, then its 1400, naturally. Crit does twice as much. The Death Ray used to do much less, but now it ussualy nukes around 700-1000 damage. Rarely, but sometimes it can nuke 1000-1500. Anytime it Crits, it will do twice as much. Just make sure you have enough hp, to take the charge damage. One time I had 1100hp left on me, charged death ray, and it killed me by eating 241 each second.(1687 nuke charging) It does about 70% of its nuke damage, to you while charging, if you don't have the hp to pay for it, it WILL kill you. Not very handly when your hp is running low, as the charge damage will just finish you off, but in short term fights, pvp, and especially when you have a healer, its a very good trade off. On a side note, if the Death Ray kills you while charging, you will not take gear dmg.<br /><br />Death Ray is a 1 shot killer in pvp, when someone snares you/roots you/etc, then trys to run away with low health. Instead of trying to chase, charge up death ray, and give them a lightning bolt. Also, if you see players fighting with 10-40%health left, charge up Death Ray and its ussualy enough to kill them off just like that. The damage it does to you, doesn't amount to much when they died first.:)<br /><br />It will still be usefull at 60 as well, since any 60mage/warlock nukes an average of 400-600, while this device nukes 700 at the very least. May become increasing useless to caster engineers 50-60, but us wars/pals/rogs have 0 ranged attacks, if we get rooted off, we're stuck standing idle. This Death Ray gives us something to shoot other then our gun.<br /><br />This device is the single reason why Gnomish Engineering is better, and any Goblin Engineer will hate himself in the future, since you cannot rechoose by any means other then a character reroll. I've been both sides, I know.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Oct 4 10:57:49 2005</div>

Just sneak up behind the guy while he's doing whatever, and blast away. If it does not kill them, spirnt up and finish them off.<br /><br />More difficult to use in BattleGrounds, but still do-able (I mean, IN a battle). Just jump back and try to fire off. Although, a lot of the time someone hits you before, so it can be good to 'hide' (I dont' mean stealth, I mean like hide behind that tree).</div>

Has a maximum range (supposedly 30 yards, but my experience tells me less), and no minimum range. And it seems to even fire if they move behind me, too.<br /><br />3. You need to make them hold still. If they aren't paying attention, that's great, but people I play against in battlegrounds recognize me now and run (LOL). Net-o-matic projector, stuns, roots, ice, sleep, or anything else that makes them stop for a few seconds while you charge it up (4 second charge time).<br /><br />4. It will kill you if you don't have enough health to finish charging.<br /><br />5. Everything you need to know about building one is available on the boards if you look for it. I had no trouble figuring out what to do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have a screenshot of Scatman hitting a mob for a whopping 3920hp. I have never reached that high, but I hit regularly for 800-1000 normal hits, and 1700-2000 high. In PVP I hit a 41 mage for 1757 -&gt; instakill. This is by far the best PVP weapon I have access to as a warlock; only compared in usefulness by Discombobulator Ray.<br /><br />My fave tactic is fight target to half HP, then sacrifice Voidwalker for the shield, and let enemy pound me while I load up the gun. He never sees death coming.<br /><br />One question if anyone know: Does damage on this thing grow by level or skill? At lvl 60 it would not be that useful if stuck at same damage output.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My friend has one of these. can do around 1K damage normal hit. 2k-3k crit hit... Mind hes only around level 260, level 40 warrior.<br /><br />When this thing is fired at you have to 2 choices. Rogues I know can kindy shot, so do that as soon as you can. I don't know about other classes. But if you can Stun, do so.<br /><br />The other choice is RUN! I duno if has a yard range. But if in dobut run. Or stay and try and kill it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The death ray never backfires, but it sometimes it appears that targets resist it to some degree. I built mine at level 36 with 260 engineering. I rarely pay attention to the damage, but I one-hitted a level 39 warrior with a 2047 shot, and I regularly finish flag carriers off with it in Warsong Gulch. It works great in combination with the Net-o-matic projector to hold them still while it charges. For PvP, using the harm prevention belt is great, too, but you can only do that once an hour. The cool-down on the death ray is 5 minutes, so use it often and get loads of laughs!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Paladins:<br /><br />If you don't use Divine Shield for anything else, use it for this product as a engineering in PVP. The cooldown times are the same, what I do is when I'm in the heat of battle and about to die, bubble, cast GDR, and still have a few seconds to Divine Favor and heal myself, using Illumination specc and regaining mana I just lost.. Biggest hit I ever had was 4011 on a Pterodactyl in Un'Goro Crater, it saved my life : )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i will miss this device as goblin engineer now but it was worth it. this thing can hit 3900? most this thing could hit for when i used it was below 3k. they must have really improved it, i knew patch said &quot;slighty&quot;, but i guess its more then that. they also cut cooldown in half, for your death ray fans. it used to be 10mins, now its 5mins. i guess they are trying to make up for usefullness of dragon guns constant use in raids or hordes of mobs. the change makes gnomish alot more powerfull, but id still be goblin.<br /><br />innoruk i hope i dont get hit with one of these.... &quot;you are dead&quot;... makes me glad im on team with the gnomes... you make them mad, you pay the price.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>every engineer with 240 engineering can use it, but only the gnomish can make, since im gnomish im thinking about buying a goblin dragon gun so i own in PvP :P great for defence and attack and awsome for alterac: or net-o-matic and deathray..<br />Or sap/stun, deathray and dragon gun<br />:D im engineering 250 and hit normally around 1700-2400, i havent got crits yet but i cant wait :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This would seem like an ultimate opening to capture the flag in WSG. Just sneak to the second floor, cast a regenerative healing per second spell and give a lowly gaurd the blasting of his life time. maybe equip this with an ice deflector/reflector and haul butt outta there. on your way out switch it with a shrinkray and discomboblator and your just pissing everyone off now. i know there a set timers for switching out trinkets but the shrinkray/ discombobulator would be for a midfield getaway. <br />Note: sorry for ignorance of any cooldowns that are shared that i may not know about. i havent made anything but the shrinkray but this sounds like heaven to me. Oh hey dont we get a harm prevention belt too? ; )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lvl 38 mage alt. never knew it was this good. first test was a 998 normal hit on a shaman one lvl lower than me.<br /><br />Best trinket till MC. this is a must for pallys, without a doubt.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have had this trinket on my rogue since he was level 25 and he is now level 47 to this day i have not crited with this thing once it still does decent dmg but it is almost obsolete i was wondering if the reason im criting is because my spell chance to crit is 0.00% lol im pretty sure this is the reason i havn't crited with it can anyone confirm for me that the Death Ray is based and Spell crit rating<br /><br /><i>Edited, Mar 31st 2007 2:05pm by TacticalJay</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this device has a 4sec cast time, during cast time it'll do around 1/10-1/4(10-25%) of the dmg that its going to fire, to you. once you hit it, it'll start charging to fire, if you cancell it or get interrupted, you still have to wait the 10mins, so make sure you are ready. you can guess how hard its gunna hit for based off how much its doing to you, but it wont be accurate because it doesnt do an exact amount of dmg. sometimes it does 100d to me for the 4secs, 400dmg total, then nukes 800-900+, sometimes it eats me for 120 for 4secs, 480dmg total, then nukes around 600-700dmg, so hp it drains off you isnt always same, but if it drains 200+ a second, you can be sure its gunna hit real hard. for the dmg, death ray ussualy nukes 600-900 most of the time for me, it hits 1k-1500dmg uncommon, and 2k+ as a very rare, the highest ive seen on mine is 2567damage, but it drained about 800+hp off me charging. most accurate is to say if it is draining 100hp off you a second, it will hit around 600-1k, if it drains 200+ a second, its gunna hit 2k+.<br /><br />the device doesn't have a real &quot;backfire&quot;, but when it does backfire, it just wont shot, it'll charge up and do nothing, no zap, only harm from backfire is the charge dmg it did to you. thats about all there is to death ray, 10min reuse for 600-1k nuke on average, very usefull to tear down big mobs or boss's, just wait little while and be aware of aggro a huge nuke does for u, should be awesome for pvp if you have way to get player off you long enough to fire, if they are hitting you, you run chance of being interrupted and getting no where. if you are leather engineer, you might be able to stack this with shield belt to fire, or net gun if you are lucky to get non backfire.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Combine this with the harm prevention belt and the damage you get wont be a problem (: However, there is ofcourse a small chance the belt will backfire on you. I just took the trip to gadgetzan to learn artisan engineering, but since I couldn't get any accurate info from neither allakhazam nor thottbot, I went there all in vain (lvl 31, can't learn artisan 'til 35). I think I have a screenshot of a friend critting for 5k (which pretty much takes out.. anything)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Great trinket in av when you're out of mana and have a warr gnawing at your casters within your deadzone as a hunter. <br /><br /><a href="http://img235.imageshack.us/img235/613/gnomishcrit6yu.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img235.imageshack.us/img235/613/gnomishcrit6yu.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As someone noted below, this is a great weapon for hunters who have casters that bind them and then attack in their dead zone. Hit them with a scatter shot and then the death ray--no more caster! Pallys can benefit from the same strategy in dealing with long range attacks, too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Has anyone else noticed that this doesn't hit so hard since 1.10? Before 1.10 I'd never seen it hit lower than 900, now it's hitting for less than 200 every time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SeekerWi</b></h3>Kind of underwhelming in classic, but might be because I play a mage. I've done plenty of PVP and this trinket was underwhelming every time. Long chargeup, significant health cost for mediocre damage. <br /><br />It may be good for some classes, but at least for mages the trinket is useless. A fireball or a frostbolt usually hits about the same or harder, casts much faster, doesn't require you to have a trinket equipped, and doesn't force you to sacrifice tons of HP.<br /><br />And you can't cheat this trinket out since it has a lengthy 4 second cast time, so for mages it's just kind of permanently useless. I would assume this is 100% as true for warlocks.<br /><br />Same goes for battle chicken, it's unreliable and as a mage, well the melee haste doesn't do anything for you. The chicken will also refuse to run towards the enemy or follow you unless you summon it pointblank. Meaning you can't summon the battle chicken out before the fight and swap trinkets - it will just remain uselessly in a spot. And thus you'd rather have an actual damage trinket equipped... I think this remains true even for melees. Since when they go melee, they'll be in combat, and thus battle chicken is not really swappable out while providing benefits, and not nearly as useful as a hand of justice or something.<br /><br />There just isn't any reason(for a caster, at least) to be a gnomish engineer, even if you plan to switch over to goblin afterwards by re-leveling engineering and keeping items. You'll be 100% as well off just levelling goblin engineer for the sick items and easy consumables, and buy the useful gnomish items from a gnomish engineer or AH.</div>
