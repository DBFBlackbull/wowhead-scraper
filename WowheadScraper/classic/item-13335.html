I see trinkets, quest items, and all sorts or other stuff people have no problems with sharing rolling rights with others over.

If i saw this drop, i would definitely need, despite my swift white steed. I have wanted either the troll or the raptor since heard of them, and i regret making my mage alliance, since i would be able to get both a raptor and an undead horse had i been a troll or undead mage.","date":"2007-02-22T19:59:49-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Frycookfrog","importedSubject":"This Horse"},{"commentv2":1,"number":159,"id":3124406,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Sammyx3","body":"This Skeletal Horse is a rare drop from [npc=10440] in [zone=2017].\n\nIt has a 1 in 5000 chance to drop from him (0.02%).\n\nIf you want to know where you can get all the other Mounts in Classic from, [url=https:\/\/classic.wowhead.com\/guide=8296\/classic-all-available-mounts-and-how-to-obtain-them-guide]check out my guide here![\/url]","date":"2019-05-28T10:09:34-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"The drop rate was bumped up, its not impossible anymore, just really annoying.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>While I don't have my epic mount yet, I'll be getting one soon. Even if I did have it I would roll.<br /><br />Sure I might not &quot;need&quot; it as much as someone who hasn't. But why should I miss out on this if I spent 800+g of my own money getting my mount? If someone without a mount loses a roll against someone who does, how is it any different? They're going to have to pay for their mount like everyone else which they would have done anyway.<br /><br />Besides, I'd probably offer 3000g to the roll winner to pass it to me instead if it dropped on a run I was on.<br /><br />If you're going to be giving it to the person with the greatest need, do you do this for all drops? If two players want a drop... for example, a 50dps weapon that is an upgrade for them. One player currently has a 40dps weapon, and the other has a 45dps weapon. Are you going to automatically give it to the person who needs the upgrade more?<br /><br />This mount may be the same speed as other epics, but I consider it an upgrade. This item doesn't effect a character, it doesn't make you better, doesn't make you stronger. So why should I pass so someone else can get it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><i>&quot;You only prove what I have been saying, that you are rolling purely for your own greed, and not out of necessity.&quot;</i><br /><br />I was just having a discussion about this recently&nbsp; My opinion is that, if someone wants an epic mount they can get 900g with solo play.&nbsp; If an epic is not important to them, or if they're too lazy to farm the gold, why should they get a higher priority than someone that isn't too lazy?<br /><br />It has the same stats as any epic, but it is not the same.&nbsp; If it were possible, it would sell for &gt; 900g, which indicates it's not even close to the same as a standard epic.&nbsp; I could see someone actually deleting their own epic just to roll on this as an upgrade.<br /><br />It seems to me that claiming only upgrades can roll is protecting the lazy and undeserving.&nbsp; Everyone should be able to roll.<br /><br />/puts on asbestos suit</div>

Any rumors you have heard about it are just that; rumors. The only requirement is &quot;convincing&quot; the Baron to hand them over to you. I must warn you though, that the Baron is very stubborn, and you may have to defeat him in battle many, many, many times before he hands them over.&quot;<br /><br />I hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay, you do NOT need Exhalted with Argent Dawn, you do NOT need to be in a 5 man, you do NOT need anything special apart from the skill in your group/raid to kill Baron and be lucky enough for this to drop at RANDOM.<br /><br />It dropped yesterday and we gave it to our resident mage, as she was the only one without an epic mount. She's very happy now and we're all glad that we have a guild full of epic mounters now.<br /><br />Remember: There is NO NEED for ANYTHING SPECIAL to get this to drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've read multiple arguments. People keep saying you must reach exalted with AD. But the fact that it has never dropped, alliance or horde in the tens of thousands of raids on my server leads me to believe that you must be exalted for it to drop, otherwise surely it would have dropped by now. Look at it this way,<a href="/classic/item=1168/skullflame-shield">Skullflame Shield</a> a 0.01 droprate, yet still hundreds of people have them.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can any1 actually verify that this item has dropped anytime at all during the last 3-4 months?<br />Imagine how many Baron kills each server actually have per day on both factions.<br />The last time some1 got this in EU Bladefist was probably 7 months ago and it was also the only time.<br />My theory after seeing that my exalted is worthless is that this mount cannot drop at all anymore. <br />Else it's real droprate is around 1/500000.<br />Remember that the mount is ranked as superior quality and raptor mount is more ussual and is epic quality.<br />blade of baron rivendare is far more common and epic quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does it matter that the drop rate is low? I mean, I've been going to Scholo to get my Dreadmist done -_- Over three or four runs still no drops. I'd rather farm this horse now with the guild raid then try to get my dreadmist done. We're going there tonight and to be honest I wouldnt be suprised if he drops his horse and I roll the lowest... *sigh*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It does drop (Duh), you DONT have to be exalted with AD (It WONT increase ur chance on finding it also, seeing as you can get this mount when ur 'hated' with AD)<br /><br />So why doesnt it drop for you? It is a FREE epic mount and different then those whom Alliance can ride, it's obvious why blizz made the drop chance so low...5 or 10 man, doesnt make a difference but if it makes you any happier...Strat will soon be a 5 man instance (ver 1.10)<br /><br />So basicly the faction rep with AD/group size/etc. to get and/or increase the drop chance is false</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just an FYI, coming from a level 60 who has his Dreadsteed(lock epic mount)...<br /><br />I have been in a few parties in Strat, and every now and then someone brings up the 'What If' Scenario... if the Baron drops his mount... blah blah<br /><br />Basically people who did not have their Epic Mount thought it was only right they those with an epic mount should pass on it.. &gt;.&lt; <br /><br />First of all, as a Warlock, I have worked harder to get my mount then most people. Hell anyone could just buy 800g off the internet and get their epic mount within minutes, I spent a fackload of time getting mine, and I did a very time consuming and expensive(spent close to 400-500g) 12 Chain Quest... when you lazy people get off your butts and put that kind of work, time and gold into getting your own epic mount, then you'll understand why those of us with them get facking pissed off that lazy people think they can not give us a chance to roll because they're too lazy to grind the gold or quest themselves...<br /><br />Just to give you an idea, here's a complete list of what a Warlock goes through to get his mount. We don't just walk up to someone and say &quot;hey, I'm a lock, gimme my epic mount!&quot;... &gt;.&lt;<br /><br /><a href="http://wow.rpgbeacon.com/quest.php?ID=471" rel="nofollow"><b>Warlock Quest: Dreadsteed</b></a><br /><br />Quit looking for an easy way and work at your epics like the rest of us! Also, everyone should roll on this because seriously, the droprate is facking uber low, and it just plain looks sweet.<br /><br />I don't want to hear someone telling me that because I'm an undead Warlock w/ my dreadsteed that I can't roll on this because I have an epic and I can just buy a Purple Skeletal Warhorse... how about you get exalted w/ Undercity, throw me the gold and I'll buy you the facking mount, and in the meantime I'm going to roll on this sweet ride.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If this dropped, I'd say everyone should roll on it. Whether you have an epic mount or not, this is a once in a lifetime drop, unless you're really really really lucky and you've seen it drop twice. So, everyone should roll need on this thing. I know I would, and I have my epic mount already. <br /><br />And yes, I worked for the money to buy my mount. I sold a really valuable item for 700g. ^_~</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes, I agree. Whoever kills Baron ought to be able to roll on it, whether or not they will benefit.<br /><br />Likewise, a Paladin should be able to roll on Netherwind gear. A Warrior should be able to roll on Avenger set pieces. A Mage should roll on Quel'serrar, right?<br /><br />It has nothing to do with the value you get, because anyone who killed the boss should be allowed to roll. <br /><br />A Mage could even equip Quel'serrar. Why aren't you arguing that they should be allowed to roll on the Foror's Compendium when it drops, because it would look totally sweet? A Mage would get more use out of Quel'serrar than a person who already has an epic would get out of Baron's Steed.<br /><br />If you'd roll on this as a person who already has an epic mount, you're a #$%^ing *!@#, who's screwing someone who would actually use this out of 900g. Boohoo for you; it didn't drop until after you bought your mount. Grow the $%^&amp; up and don't screw somebody who might actually benefit from it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is simple logic so i hope everyone can understand it easily enough. This item is a reward for killing and end boss, therefore, whether or not u have an epic mount has absolutely nothing to do with who should get it. Whomever undertook the effort to clear the instance and kill Baron should all have an equal chance at this item. Would it be nice of someone who already has an epic mount to pass for someone who doesnt? Sure, but it's their right to roll if they helped clear the instance and they can use it. Now with the changes to mount pricing tho mounts don't cost very much anyway it's training that costs alot.</div>

I know that people are supposed to be able to learn how to ride, and ride, mounts from the other faction, as a number of sites have said so, and the descriptions of (some) of the items to summon mounts say that races of both factions can use it (I think only the mounts that are unrideable by some races say this; *edit* As does THIS mount!).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It sure must be rare, since it's not even listed. Uhm, sure this drops, never seen it though, one thing i'm really wondering about is if BR really drops it? cause it is not listed in Baron's list of all possible drops =/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, only Baron Rivendare can drop his mount - that seems logical.<br />Allakhazam's loot tables have been wiped since 1.10 changes the chances of droppings from some bosses, so the pool is gathered again - When someone with software like WoWreader(?) will see it drop - it will be listed.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Apr 11 01:30:36 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Since the 1.10 patch, Allakhazam wiped the Baron's loot table, as it was changed by Blizzard.<br /><br />The Baron now has 2 loot tables, one normal, and an improved one if you kill him within 45 minutes of opening the second gate. I think this mount will now be on this improved table.<br /><br />Until patch 1.11, only those with the 0.5 tier armour quests have access to this improved table, this has been pointed out as a bug. 1.11 will see everyone who kills him within 45 minutes getting access to the better loot.<br /><br />So for now, only those on the quest can get this mount, this will change in 1.11.<br /><br />As suggested in the subject, these are simply my thoughts, a mixture of opinions and facts :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>An undead warlock has this on my server. Why? I don't know. People say, &quot;It's Baron's mount and a super rare drop, so it's good for anyone to have.&quot; This is true, but an UNDEAD? Baron Rivendare, last time I checked, was indeed undead, therefore his mount doesn't look any different than epic undead mounts.<br /><br />And also, I don't see why the drop has to be insanely rare. ZG drops are about 1%. I guess, now that I think about it, ZG is a 3day reset, as opposed to Stratholme, which can be reset instantly.<br /><br />Someone argue with this. I'm interested to see what people have to say.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 8th 2006 at 7:33am EDT by MeinHerzBrennt</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I belive that everyone should be able to roll. Some people say that it should go to somebody that dosent have a mount... this is just crazyness! lol. I would easily give up all my gear, and gold just to have this mount. It would be like saying, you have a $300 beater of a car, and you just won a $1.5million car like the Bugatti Veyron, fully insured, liftime maintnance, but you give it to someone else because you already have a car. :P That would just be crazy! Although... I dont think you should be able to roll if your not 60, and dont have the training for it. Mostly because, it may never be used! I read on forums, on 2 acounts, that people have won this mount, never got epic mount training, and stoped playing wow! X| That makes me want to cry! It should go to somebody that can use it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just my <br />i dont think you <i>can</i> ninja this. all roll need, thats what i say when i go to Strat(just in case it drops). Who doesn't need a mount that looks like this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol ok this subject seems alittle muddled so im just gunna list my views :)<br /><br />1) Everyone should need, with or without epic mounts of w/e class they are<br />2) Damn thats a cool mount<br />3) Argent dawn rep doesnt affect drop rate O_O there goes alot of watsed time &gt;_&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>after reading post after post of people comparing it to classes rolling on other class' armor/weapons (which i think is bull since it has nothing to do with this).<br /><br />Someone rolling for an epic armor/weapon that they can't use or is worse than their current armor when it would be an upgrade for someone else is wrong i'll aggree. That is unless the person with sucky armor/weapons knows you have higher importance in the group for the item.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a NONCOMBAT ITEM, as in you don't start a fight and somehow win when you have this mount with you. It won't heal you or give you extra hp/mana/dmg. You ride it around and look cool, that's it. And as such why don't you roll on it like that? I see trinkets, quest items, and all sorts or other stuff people have no problems with sharing rolling rights with others over. Perfect example are the invader's scorge stones, you don't say, &quot;hey, who has the lowest/highest rep we'll give it to them&quot;. No, you all greed or need depending on your group, unless someone is nice and passes.<br /><br />Point is unless one of you already have this you should ALL roll no matter what mount you have (not that you could roll if you had it anyhow since it's unique, but you get my point).<br /><br />Infact if you wanted to split hairs people without epic mount training should have lower rolling status just cause they can't actualy use it when they get it. But still, i say they should be allowed to roll anyways.<br /><br />EDIT: Also to clarify so as not to have people saying i'm biased and don't know both sides of the fence, i have chars both with and without epic mounts/training.<br /><br /><i>Edited, May 17th 2007 4:34am by zaderp</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As of right now Taurens can't ride it and I doubt they will ever be able to.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>DAMN THAT THING IS FRIKING AWSOME!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Way too many misconceptions in these comments.<br /><br />The mount is a regular rare drop on the baron's loot table, that means it always has a chance to drop. You don't need any AD rep, you don't need an AD trinket equipped, and you don't need to be in a 5-man.<br /><br />The drop rate is probably 1 in 50,000 or higher. As to why a horde would go crazy over this I have no idea since the undead mounts look just as good, but if I was alliance in a pickup I would ninja this before you could say &quot;deathcharger's reigns&quot; It's the rarest item in the game period, after you have this you might as well stop playing because you're not going to top it. <br /><br />To give you an idea of how rare this is, our server is a day 1 retail server with a relatively high population, and this mount has never dropped on our server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Man who don't want this mount?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>why would i want to help someone i don't know save gold? i PvP'ed my way to a 90g mount. but i'll still roll on the deathcharger.<br />if it was a guild run, i would still roll on it. there are 2 on my server i believe, and it's not exactly a new server. (not all the way through naxx, but multiple bosses are on farm status)<br /><br />and why did someone compare a mount, able to be used by all races/classes, to gear that is only usable by 1 (or 2 like quel) classes?<br /><br />and why are you saying &quot;boohoo&quot;? you're the one whining about people not passing on a mount so you don't have to work for one.<br /><br />and another thing. if you're gonna curse, curse. nobody is impressed with your %$#%^^%$ crap.<br /><br />while i was typing this lovely rant, i scrolled back up 4 or 5 times just to read &quot;A Mage could even equip Quel'serrar&quot; because it made me laugh. it's not true.... so either you're blatantly lying, or you have never seen a foror's compendium. and if you've dinged 60, you should have seen one on the auction house at least. with all your false info, maybe you bought your account on ebay or something? hm<br /><br />oh i just realized another thing. it requires 150 riding. which means 720g anyways...more proof of ebay?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my opinion, everyone should get a chance to roll on this mount. This is one of the most sought after mounts in the game, who wouldn't want it. First of all, alot of people claim someone with an epic mount should not be able to roll need on this. I'm not going to start saying that those who want it to avoid paying for it are lazy #$%^&amp;*!s and should earn it. Honestly, who wants to spend that much? And if you already have an epic mount, ofcourse you're going to want this anyway. It's an awesome looking mount, and one of the rarest items in the game. If i saw this drop, i would definitely need, despite my swift white steed. I have wanted either the troll or the raptor since heard of them, and i regret making my mage alliance, since i would be able to get both a raptor and an undead horse had i been a troll or undead mage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sammyx3</b></h3>This Skeletal Horse is a rare drop from <a href="/classic/npc=10440/baron-rivendare">Baron Rivendare</a> in <a href="/classic/zone=2017/stratholme">Stratholme</a>.<br /><br />It has a 1 in 5000 chance to drop from him (0.02%).<br /><br />If you want to know where you can get all the other Mounts in Classic from, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guide=8296/classic-all-available-mounts-and-how-to-obtain-them-guide">check out my guide here!</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BaronThomas</b></h3>In case anyone is wondering this mount<u> <i>STILL DROPS!</i></u><br /><br />I got it tonight, on Lightbringer. I have been farming this things casually over the course of the last 10 to 12 years, on my DK, on my druid, on my pally, and on my mage, whatever I felt like playing. All total I have over 200 kills on the baron.<br /><br />Was it worth it? Well, yes and no.<br /><br />Tonight when it dropped I actually yelled &quot;YES! THERE IT IS!&quot; and I am just stupid happy that I'll never have to run Stratholme again. At the same time it's a lot of time grinding an old world instance for a mount that doesn't fly... YMMV.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kaorhy</b></h3>Unbelievable but true, this mount will be much, much rarer than the black qiraji scarab mount in classic.<br />1 out of 5000 chances (more if you roll against 4 other players).<br />Technically this mount is harder to get than the scarab.<br />This mount symbolizes the highest prestige you could get for a mount, sadly odds are you're never going to even see it in game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kurji</b></h3>This item has the highest vendor value of any blue quality item in the game with <a href="/classic/item=21806/gavel-of-qiraji-authority">Gavel of Qiraji Authority</a> coming second at 10g 36s 86c.</div>
