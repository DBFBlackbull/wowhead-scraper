You are most likely going to aggo 2 or 3 minimum at the murloc camps (I screwed up and had 5 on me once), so come prepared.\n\nIf you don't know which camp has the book, use your Eye of Kilrogg to scout it out before you start attacking. Once you know which camp it is in, be prepared for a tough fight.\n\nOR...you can do it the easy way and use what I call the \"Diversion Trick\".\n\nSummon the VW and target a murloc deep into the camp.&nbsp; Send him in.&nbsp; Give him time to get the aggro of all the murlocs in the camp...shouldn't take more than a second or two. While he is doing this, select another target way off in the distance away from the camp.&nbsp; Have him attack it.&nbsp; He leaves and all the Murlocs in the camp follow him. Then you go in and grab the book, then run. If your lucky you can either sacrifice your VW for the shield which gives you time to run, or you can just let him die and get far enough away before the mob of murlocs comes after you. But even if you die, you'll have your book.\n\nThis tactic is one of my staples and works like a charm in lots of situations.

Go East to the river then follow along the river shore-line South. Most of the mobs that roam the river aren't aggro.\nAnd there's less of a chance of Allies spotting you along this path versus traveling the roads. Everyone travels the roads.\nDon't swim the River, though. Your moving too slow and your going to definetly need to keep moving. So, just run along the river.\n\n(2): Once you hit the gulf you'll run into some aggro mobs. And they're peppered pretty thick. But with a couple pulls here and there you shouldn't have much trouble weaving through them.\nThey're all around level 29-30. So it shouldn't be much problem with your Succubus out.\n\n(3): Once you make a path through the aggro cast Undying Breath on yourself and swim out into the water until the aggro thins out even more.\nStay under water and work your way West. \nThis is the best way to avoid Allies along the South Shore line.\n\n(4): After a short time you'll start running into Murlocs. Keep avoiding them, but beware their aggro range is pretty high and they'll chase for quite awhile with ranged attacks. They hit hard too, so if you grab one's attention I'd suggest just turning to face it off instead of continuing to run.\nTry to stay below the surface of the water.\n\n(5): At about 29,30 you'll come to a Murloc camp right at the water's edge.\nThere'll be a chest at the camp and a ton of Murlocs roaming around it.\nUse your Eye Of Killrog to scout up around the camp and make sure you know exactlly where the Tome is if your unsure.\nThe Tome is a small black book sitting on the ground close to the water's edge. Which would be the South side of the camp.\n\n(6): Kill the few Murloc stragglers roaming in the water so you can get yourself realtivly close to the camp. But keep yourself in the water a safe distance.\n\n(7): Use your Voidwalker, if you aren't already, and send him in on the furthest Murloc from the shore.\nAll the Murlocs should almost instantly aggro in on your Voidwalker. Run in as soon as you see him pull their attention and grab the Tome.\nDon't try to grab the Chest sitting by the book. You most likely won't have time before your Voidwalker bites it and the Murlocs aggro in on you.\n\n(8): Run off back into the water a safe distance and Herth yourself back home.\n\nHope this was helpfull.","date":"2006-03-11T03:21:09-06:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"neopunk","importedSubject":"Gravy...Mmm, Gravy."},{"commentv2":1,"number":17,"id":2649791,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"&nbsp; Here is what I did to get the tome at lvl 32 and it was a breeze.

Send your voidwalker in to aggro all the mobs, and then follow behind and loot the book. Then sac your VW and run to safety.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>41804</b></h3>The book is just right on the ground. Not inside any chest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Also, it is sitting in the open, black in color(not in a chest or anything, right near the Hut/boxes near Azurelode Mine</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Go to the Azurelode Mine and follow the path there down to the shore.&nbsp; Go three camps East down the shore.&nbsp; The Tome is black and sitting out in the open amoung some crates.&nbsp; Enjoy your felhunter!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Every one says this is the easy half of the book to get, but I found it was much harder than the piece you find with the centaurs in the Thousand Needles.&nbsp; If you play your cards right with the centaurs, you only have to fight one MOB at a time.&nbsp; With these murlocs, that is close to impossible. You are most likely going to aggo 2 or 3 minimum at the murloc camps (I screwed up and had 5 on me once), so come prepared.<br /><br />If you don't know which camp has the book, use your Eye of Kilrogg to scout it out before you start attacking. Once you know which camp it is in, be prepared for a tough fight.<br /><br />OR...you can do it the easy way and use what I call the &quot;Diversion Trick&quot;.<br /><br />Summon the VW and target a murloc deep into the camp.&nbsp; Send him in.&nbsp; Give him time to get the aggro of all the murlocs in the camp...shouldn't take more than a second or two. While he is doing this, select another target way off in the distance away from the camp.&nbsp; Have him attack it.&nbsp; He leaves and all the Murlocs in the camp follow him. Then you go in and grab the book, then run. If your lucky you can either sacrifice your VW for the shield which gives you time to run, or you can just let him die and get far enough away before the mob of murlocs comes after you. But even if you die, you'll have your book.<br /><br />This tactic is one of my staples and works like a charm in lots of situations. It is one of the reasons Warlocks are the best solo class in my opinion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Coord. 27,73.&nbsp; Black book is hard to see on the black shore, it's directly left of the chest at this hut, lying on the ground.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So, done it today 8. of March 05 at Lvl 31 alone.<br />And it was easy.<br /><br />Either they made it easier, or the comments above... well i wont continue.<br /><br />I cleared off the vicinity of the murloc camp, in which the book is lying (scouting with the eye of killrog helps really a lot) from patrolling murlocs. Then pulled out the ones inside the camp one by one. The max number were 2 at a time, which was no prob, as they r 28-31 in this area.<br /><br />Altogether there were 5 Murlocs standing IN the camp, not 30.<br /><br />So if u want to get ur Felhunter: be a man. Do it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>really really easy to take...pull all murlocks with vw and order him another target, than loot the book and...RUN! lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The tome isn't Too bad to see if you are using your Eye of Kilrogg.&nbsp; When you go to the mine west of southshore there is one murloc camp directly south of it.&nbsp; East of this first camp there are 2 camps close to each other, then a 4th camp further East.&nbsp; Is is about 1 foot from the water in front of these tents at the 4th cluster of tents.&nbsp; I counted 4 clusters but the 2nd and 3rd groupings are a several feet apart so you should be able to tell which I mean when I say 4th.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soloing as a 30 'Lock I took a try at the slow and steady kill 1-2 at time. After a guy zippped up outta the sea and blew the thing to bits I said screw that. I rezzed me and my VW. positioned us to the one side of the village with the next village down sighted inline with the one I needed to clear. I had my VW attack someone in the far village. He dragged all the murcs with him. Total time from start to finish was under a minute. Scout with you EofK to make sure you are in the right spot. The coord given here are on the money. Good luck. Now for part two.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>am standing at the book can not get it. yes i do have the quest reset it 2 times and the right place. ask ed blizzard for help 2 times same thing they say reset the quest. have watch the book for over 20mins to see if will reset&nbsp; &nbsp; Help</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lol for all of you locks that are clicking on a big black book that doesnt pick up, its the wrong book! the one you're looking for is hidden behind two crates, a small navy book. Good luck~^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>after endless search still cant find the damn book... <br />how can i find or from which map to read coords of place..<br />need some help...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>took me a while to figure out, but thottbot isnt as reliable as it seems... you find this ON THE GROUND in a MURLOC CAMP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soloed it with ease at level 32. Just pulled 2 at a time..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As Horde this quest can be a little tricky if only for all the higher level Allies running around.<br /><br />After a couple times of trying to get to the Murloc camp I ended up going about the entire thing like this.<br /><br />(1): From Undercity grab a bat to Tarren Mill. Go East to the river then follow along the river shore-line South. Most of the mobs that roam the river aren't aggro.<br />And there's less of a chance of Allies spotting you along this path versus traveling the roads. Everyone travels the roads.<br />Don't swim the River, though. Your moving too slow and your going to definetly need to keep moving. So, just run along the river.<br /><br />(2): Once you hit the gulf you'll run into some aggro mobs. And they're peppered pretty thick. But with a couple pulls here and there you shouldn't have much trouble weaving through them.<br />They're all around level 29-30. So it shouldn't be much problem with your Succubus out.<br /><br />(3): Once you make a path through the aggro cast Undying Breath on yourself and swim out into the water until the aggro thins out even more.<br />Stay under water and work your way West. <br />This is the best way to avoid Allies along the South Shore line.<br /><br />(4): After a short time you'll start running into Murlocs. Keep avoiding them, but beware their aggro range is pretty high and they'll chase for quite awhile with ranged attacks. They hit hard too, so if you grab one's attention I'd suggest just turning to face it off instead of continuing to run.<br />Try to stay below the surface of the water.<br /><br />(5): At about 29,30 you'll come to a Murloc camp right at the water's edge.<br />There'll be a chest at the camp and a ton of Murlocs roaming around it.<br />Use your Eye Of Killrog to scout up around the camp and make sure you know exactlly where the Tome is if your unsure.<br />The Tome is a small black book sitting on the ground close to the water's edge. Which would be the South side of the camp.<br /><br />(6): Kill the few Murloc stragglers roaming in the water so you can get yourself realtivly close to the camp. But keep yourself in the water a safe distance.<br /><br />(7): Use your Voidwalker, if you aren't already, and send him in on the furthest Murloc from the shore.<br />All the Murlocs should almost instantly aggro in on your Voidwalker. Run in as soon as you see him pull their attention and grab the Tome.<br />Don't try to grab the Chest sitting by the book. You most likely won't have time before your Voidwalker bites it and the Murlocs aggro in on you.<br /><br />(8): Run off back into the water a safe distance and Herth yourself back home.<br /><br />Hope this was helpfull.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; Here is what I did to get the tome at lvl 32 and it was a breeze. Go south of camp, kill the ones in the water and the stragglers to the left by pulling em in the water, kick on suffering and send in the void, as soon as he gets the agro loot the Tome and head north. Almost saved my void also :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just took this at lvl 30 with my VW out. Only had to use HS at one point where I was tanking 3 murlocs.<br /><br />You guys seriously rolled the wrong class, I'm so very serious...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It seems easier if you make your run for the tome from the water.&nbsp; I did it the old fashioned way... I had my Succubus out and and I would pull Murlocs one or two at a time.&nbsp; If I pulled two, then my Succubus would Seduce one and put him out of the fight while I finished off the other one.&nbsp; After clearing out the camp, I simply swam in and got the Tome (which is right on the shore, on the water-side of the camp, in the middle.)<br /><br />Solo'ed it at Level 30 (although I did level up to 31 when I was fighting one of the Coastrunners)<br /><br />I highly suggest you have a Healthstone ready.&nbsp; I had a couple of Murlocs spawn on top of me after I had grabbed the Tome.&nbsp; I tapped them all with Curse of Weakness and ran like a little girl.&nbsp; Got back to Southshore with the tome with no problems after that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i found it south of that mine and i just looked from the cliff to see which camp had the book] i basically pulled the 2 guys on the left side and killed them (31 warlock at the time using a VW) and then pulled 3 more and had 2 atatcking my VW and 1 atatcking me and the one i just put dots on and feared him and the other 2 i did the same too once i killed the first one..its easy you dont need to run in and sacrifice ur VW like everyone else did</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i cant complete those murlocs seem to see me from miles away and i think they are all linked<br />iam lvl 32!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>all right i did thanks to krattath (my VW)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Follow the repeated instructions you've read above multiple times and you will not lose.<br /><br />After scouting the camp from the water which contains the book, send VW in to aggro, then send to a far off murloc .. while they kill him, you cna sac if you want but they chase you earlier.<br /><br />By the time VW is dead, you have the book.&nbsp; I jammed towards the hill then detoured to the water.&nbsp; They lost aggro.&nbsp; I popped a healthstone but I didn't really have to.&nbsp; I finished with 370/1206 hp left.<br /><br />No sweat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if your patient enough, just swim around the mobs until your <b>directly south of 27,72 murloc hut</b>.&nbsp; fight the mobs surrounding that hut and grab the item.&nbsp; its <b>looks like a book on the ground lying to the left of the solid chest</b>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I approached co-ords from the hills, sent VW into the middle, drew agro and then sent him off down the beach while I snagged the book and legged it. In and out in &lt;30 seconds.<br />Lvl 32. HTH</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The exact coordinates are <b>27, 72</b> as listed before. The book is right near the huts though, so you may want to bring a friend or send your voidwalker in before recovering the Tome (the murlocs are so close together that it is nearly impossible to pull aggro one by one. Unless you can handle 3-4 murlocs on you, the voidwalker should be sent in).<br /><br />This is the book:<br /><br /><a href="http://img122.imageshack.us/img122/7578/tomegw2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img122.imageshack.us/img122/7578/tomegw2.jpg</a><br /><br />This is where you must go to get it:<br /><br /><a href="http://img122.imageshack.us/img122/4420/minetj4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img122.imageshack.us/img122/4420/minetj4.jpg</a><br /><br />(Yes, that is my corpse below the Party Note. I saw the book before I died, so trust me...that is the exact location of the book :D)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>/tloc 28,73</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I swam to 27, 77 then fought my way through. only like four or five mobs there. np after i found the place</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I keep seeing people saying its so hard to solo, Sure&nbsp; the fact that Im affliction spec helps save my health with siphon life buffed up drain life.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The cooridinates are much more helpful than just about any of the other hints were. Yes, they gang up on you. But at level 34 I was able to Solo it fairly easily. The problem was that before I found the cooridinates, I was looking through the murloc camps right near the town in Southshore, and those murlocs are a little higher in level, but more dangerously, they are much much more numerous. You can get your murloc heads there for THAT quest, but the Moldy Tome is much further up the coast. I went over land and then gently down the mountains to the shore and that worked well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Scroll up.<br /><br />The picture above is 100% correct.<br /><br />But for the actual fighting part, get a group...<br />Unfortunatley, you have to pay them, so have some gold ready. <br /><br />If you are one of those uber poor people, then simply summon your Voidwalker, tell him to attack all the murlocs in the camp, then tell him to attack a murloc in another camp. While your VW is getting pwned run up, get the book, and either <br />1. Run Like Hell (If your Voidwalker's dead)<br />2. Sacrifice (If your Voidwalker has almost no health)<br /><br />or<br /><br />3. Make your Voidwalker Passive and Run Like Hell (If your Voidwalker has enough health to take it)</div>
