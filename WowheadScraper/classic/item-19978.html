So here's the whole scoop on the sunday fishing contest, fishing in general, and Mr. Pinchy.\r\n\r\nThe 5 W's\r\nWho: You.\r\nWhat: The Stranglethorn Vale Fishing Tournament\r\nWhen: Every Sunday at 14:00 (2:00 PM) local server time\r\nWhere: Stranglethorn Vale\r\nWhy: For kicks, some decent prizes, and because it's something other than grinding.\r\n\r\nGetting Started:\r\n\r\nFishing Skill:\r\nAll you need to get started is a fishing pole and a decent level of fishing skill. You will need about 200 base fishing level to minimize or eliminate \"Your fish got way!\" messages. Do NOT use lures in the contest as any time not having a bobber in the water or going to the next hole after one despawns to get your bobber back into action is time wasted.\r\n\r\nFishing Pole:\r\nNote that there are a few vendors that sell a (limited Quantity)Strong Fishing Pole (+5 Fishing Skill). Every little bit helps, so you should always be using this instead of the regular fishing pole (Also, you can get the Big Iron Fishing Pole, with a whopping +20 to fishing, instead... it's a rare drop from Shellfish Crates that are part of a Horde quest line in Desolace Also the best pole the Alliance can get without winning the contest. Seth's graphite fishing pole from Shattrath's \"I'd Rather be Fishing\" quest is also +20, but not as easily\/quickly attained, and also requires you to have the expansion and be high enough lvl to get and complete the quest).\r\n\r\nHorde characters can get Nat Pagle's Extreme Angler FC-5000 via the Snapjaws Mon! quest in the hinterlands, which gives +25 to fishing and is therefore the best possible pole (aside form the one you can win in this tournament) to fish with.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can pick up a +2 to Fishing Skill enchant on your gloves if you're able to find an enchanter able to do it.\r\n\r\nLevel:\r\nWhile you can theoretically win the contest as a level 10 character, the reality of it is that you'll probably want to be at least level 40 before you attempt this, for two reasons: First, you'll want a mount for the speed increase (see below); second, the area you'll be running around in is quite full of mobs between levels 35 and 45. If you are in combat, you aren't fishing - so you'll need to avoid constantly getting aggro'd by everything around you.\r\n\r\nSpeed Increase:\r\nYou'll also want to have something to drastically increase your speed, as you'll need to travel to new fishing nodes\/holes that are several yards away, every 2-3 minutes. The faster the better. In order of preference:\r\n\r\nA. Epic mount\r\nB. Regular mount\r\nC. Mount Speed Increase items like a riding crop, crusader aura, carrot on a stick, mithril spurs, riding skill enchant on gloves.\r\nD. Sprint\/Dash\/Aspect of the Cheetah\/etc (+~40-50% speed increase)\r\nE. Azure Silk Belt (increases swim speed by 15%)\r\nF. Swimspeed Potions\r\nG. Druid Aqatic form\r\nH. Hook of the Master Angler (choosable reward from winning the contest)\r\n\r\nHearthstone:\r\nMake certain that you set your Hearthstone to Booty Bay, and that you do not use your Hearthstone after about 13:15 (1:15pm) local server time. If you want to win you want to minimize wasted time as much as possible, and that is the fastest way to get back to booty bay after you get your 40 fish.\r\n\r\nInventory Space:\r\nLast but not least, you will want a decent amount of empty inventory slots free. I would recomend at least 8 free inventory slots in your bags or more.. You may want to have a little extra space just in case. Most fish (including the Tastyfish) stack in lots of 20, so you probably wont need it, but just so you're aware...","date":"2007-04-21T08:45:03-05:00","rating":25,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":3,"id":70418,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"25988","body":"Tournament Basics:\r\nAnnouncements\r\nAt approximately 30 seconds after the server clock hits 14:00 (2:00 PM), a \/yell will be sent to all of Stranglethorn Vale indicating that the Fishing Tournament has begun.

Yes, the entire coast is in-play with the exception of booty bay itself and Juergo isle (the large one on the east side of STV). The nodes look like small whirlpools, 2-3 yards in diameter, complete with silvery fish flickering in and out. They are visible from a good distance as a shimmering spot in the water.\r\n\r\nSpawn Locations:\r\nThe locations of the nodes are fixed. That is, a node is either there or not there, but the locations do not change. You'll find that there is a spawn location approximately every 100-200 yards or so along the coast, so there are many pools forming constantly. The best way to learn them is to participate in the tournament - you'll be lost the first time, but you'll learn them more as you continue to participate each week.","date":"2007-04-21T08:46:07-05:00","rating":37,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":4,"id":70420,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"25988","body":"How to Catch the Elusive Tastyfish:\r\nIn order to catch Tastyfish, you must cast your bobber inside one of the fishing nodes. To be on the safe side, ensure that your bobber is at least partially touching the edge of the swirling waters. Ideally, cast it right into the center so you don't have to worry. If you miss, re-cast again. There is no way to guarantee that your bobber will land in the right place. Learn how far back to stand so that the average-distance cast will at least have a chance to intersect the pool itself (stand too close and you'll always overcast; stand too far and your bobber will never make it out to the pool).\r\n\r\nOnce your bobber lands in a good position, just wait and fish as normal. You'll reel in either some Stranglekelp, a Tastyfish, very occasionally a rare fish (very rare) or something else (anything you could normally catch in these waters goes here).\r\n\r\nNode Mechanics:\r\nIt seems that the nodes are quantity based, similar to other resource nodes. There are approximately 2 to 6 Tastyfish per node. Once they've all been caught, the node will disappear.\r\n\r\nMultiple people can and will fish in a single node. Multiple bobbers will clutter the whirlpool and make it hard to click and mean that the hole will be fished out and dissapear that much faster. Generally, that means that you want to skip that hole and find an empty one...I only fish in holes that other people are in if I am certain or at least very sure they just got there, and then I wont get more than 1-2 fish before i mount up and find the next one to stay ahead of the competion thats fishing that node.\r\n\r\nChanging Nodes:\r\nAs soon as a node despawns, immediately mount (or hit your speed boost) and proceed to the next most probable location for a spawn. This is something you will learn from experience. If you know a nearby pool despawned 5-10 minutes ago, head there now, as this seems to be the approximate time between respawns.\r\n(don't swim unless its unavoidable, you have azure silk belt, swimspeed pots, aquatic form, or already have the hook of the master angler).\r\n\r\nThings to Watch Out for:\r\nThere are quite a few nasties along the STV coast if you are around the lvl 40 area. On the southwest side are the highest level mobs in the area, namely varieties of Naga. These are particularly annoying because they wander far (even into the ocean) and have a large aggro radius, are social, and like to net you.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the west coast is (for the most part) inhabited by Crocolisks and Raptors, of which the Crocolisks are by far the worst since they (like the Naga) will sometimes enter the water where you are.\r\n\r\nThe east coast of Stranglethorn, by comparison, is great. The ruins can be a problem if you are below level 40; levels 40 and up will generally be able to walk past without a problem. The one thing you must watch out for, regardless of your level, is the unique level 47+ Elite Giant Gorlash. He roams the shore slowly and is easily avoided, but there are always a disturbing number of skeletons near him when you pass by.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, if you are on a PvP server, watch out for the enemy. you will hate your life as this event is commonly referred to on PvP servers as the \"Stranglethorn Vale Fishing Gankfest\".\r\n\r\nThe Tournament Completed\r\nHow Long This Takes:\r\nNormally the Winner for the week has caught and turned in their fish in less than 30 minutes...about the longest I have seen the contest go before a winner is about 42 minutes. the last two times i won in 24 and 29 minutes.","date":"2007-04-21T08:49:16-05:00","rating":23,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":70424,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"25988","body":"Fishing in General.\r\nAt Fishing Lvl 525 or higher, you will stop seeing \"your fish got away!\" messages no matter where you go, including the 3 fly-to only lakes in Terrokar Forest which have the highest fishing requirement and best fished items in the game.\r\n427 is the highest fishing skill you can have unlured (same as above, but with the +2 fishing skill to glove enchant as well), which makes the in-game cap for fishing 527 with an aquadynamic fish attractor.\r\n\r\nHow to get 527 Fishing\r\n375 Base Fishing Skill\r\n+40 Arcanite Fishing Pole (+35 from the pole, +5 from putting the High Test Eternium Fishing Line on it for total of +40)\r\n+5 Lucky Fishing Hat\r\n+5 Nat Pagle's Extreme Anglin' Boots\r\n+2 Fishing Skill Enchant to gloves\r\n+100 Aquadynamic Fish Attractor (lure)\r\n\r\nLeveling Fishing:\r\nFishing in even the lowest lvl water can and will lvl you fishing, and even in the lowest of waters like the pond in org, it wil take no more than 14 successful casts to gain a skill lvl. \r\nFishing 1-75 - Learned from trainer.\r\nFishing 75-150 - Learned from trainer\r\nFishing 150-225 - You will need to get and read the Expert Fishing Book that you can buy from Old Man Hemming in Booty Bay on the Lowest level of the town. \r\nFishing 225-300 - At lvl 225 you will Have to go to the islands in Dustwallow Marsh and Find Nat Pagle to get a quest from him to catch 4 rare fish, one for The savage coast in STV, one from the Verdantis River in Feralas, one from the norther Sartheris Strand in Desolace (there are actually two stretches of coast labled as Sartheris strand, you need the northern one that is near the sunken boats), and one from the coastline in Swamp of Sorrows.

You will need to have about 480 or more fishing to reliably catch the fish in these lakes...being Furious Crawdads, Goldenscale Vendorfish (that vendor for 6g per! ), Golden Darters, crates, scrollcases, and possibly Mr. Pinchy.\r\n\r\n(As a side note, Furious crawdads only come from those Highland Mixed Schools, which are used in cooking Spicy crawdad, Which gives you 30 stam and 20 spirit for 30 minutes if you spend at least 10 seconds eating)\r\n\r\nJust like there the rare fish in STV during the contest, there is a very small chance that you can catch Mr. Pinchy, a rare Crawdad that will have 3 wishes (charges) that give a random effect\/item with a 48 hour cooldown from those Highland mixed pools.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25988</b></h3>So here's the scoop on the Stranglethorn Vale Fishing Extravaganza: More information can be found here which is where I got the info- <br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Arcanite%20Fishing%20Pole">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Arcanite%20Fishing%20Pole</a><br /><br />Hey there Angler! So here's the whole scoop on the sunday fishing contest, fishing in general, and Mr. Pinchy.<br /><br />The 5 W's<br />Who: You.<br />What: The Stranglethorn Vale Fishing Tournament<br />When: Every Sunday at 14:00 (2:00 PM) local server time<br />Where: Stranglethorn Vale<br />Why: For kicks, some decent prizes, and because it's something other than grinding.<br /><br />Getting Started:<br /><br />Fishing Skill:<br />All you need to get started is a fishing pole and a decent level of fishing skill. You will need about 200 base fishing level to minimize or eliminate &quot;Your fish got way!&quot; messages. Do NOT use lures in the contest as any time not having a bobber in the water or going to the next hole after one despawns to get your bobber back into action is time wasted.<br /><br />Fishing Pole:<br />Note that there are a few vendors that sell a (limited Quantity)Strong Fishing Pole (+5 Fishing Skill). Every little bit helps, so you should always be using this instead of the regular fishing pole (Also, you can get the Big Iron Fishing Pole, with a whopping +20 to fishing, instead... it's a rare drop from Shellfish Crates that are part of a Horde quest line in Desolace Also the best pole the Alliance can get without winning the contest. Seth's graphite fishing pole from Shattrath's &quot;I'd Rather be Fishing&quot; quest is also +20, but not as easily/quickly attained, and also requires you to have the expansion and be high enough lvl to get and complete the quest).<br /><br />Horde characters can get Nat Pagle's Extreme Angler FC-5000 via the Snapjaws Mon! quest in the hinterlands, which gives +25 to fishing and is therefore the best possible pole (aside form the one you can win in this tournament) to fish with.<br /><br />Also, you can pick up a +2 to Fishing Skill enchant on your gloves if you're able to find an enchanter able to do it.<br /><br />Level:<br />While you can theoretically win the contest as a level 10 character, the reality of it is that you'll probably want to be at least level 40 before you attempt this, for two reasons: First, you'll want a mount for the speed increase (see below); second, the area you'll be running around in is quite full of mobs between levels 35 and 45. If you are in combat, you aren't fishing - so you'll need to avoid constantly getting aggro'd by everything around you.<br /><br />Speed Increase:<br />You'll also want to have something to drastically increase your speed, as you'll need to travel to new fishing nodes/holes that are several yards away, every 2-3 minutes. The faster the better. In order of preference:<br /><br />A. Epic mount<br />B. Regular mount<br />C. Mount Speed Increase items like a riding crop, crusader aura, carrot on a stick, mithril spurs, riding skill enchant on gloves.<br />D. Sprint/Dash/Aspect of the Cheetah/etc (+~40-50% speed increase)<br />E. Azure Silk Belt (increases swim speed by 15%)<br />F. Swimspeed Potions<br />G. Druid Aqatic form<br />H. Hook of the Master Angler (choosable reward from winning the contest)<br /><br />Hearthstone:<br />Make certain that you set your Hearthstone to Booty Bay, and that you do not use your Hearthstone after about 13:15 (1:15pm) local server time. If you want to win you want to minimize wasted time as much as possible, and that is the fastest way to get back to booty bay after you get your 40 fish.<br /><br />Inventory Space:<br />Last but not least, you will want a decent amount of empty inventory slots free. I would recomend at least 8 free inventory slots in your bags or more.. You may want to have a little extra space just in case. Most fish (including the Tastyfish) stack in lots of 20, so you probably wont need it, but just so you're aware...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25988</b></h3>Tournament Basics:<br />Announcements<br />At approximately 30 seconds after the server clock hits 14:00 (2:00 PM), a /yell will be sent to all of Stranglethorn Vale indicating that the Fishing Tournament has begun. Another yell will be sent when the contest has been won, A third and final yell will be sent at 16:00 (4pm) letting you know that the fish are gone and that you have one more hour to turn in fish.<br /><br />Goals:<br /><br />Goal #1: The main goal of the tournament is to be the first to catch 40 Tastyfish and to return them to the goblin contest master Riggle Bassbait in Booty Bay. Riggle stands on the dock just outside of the Inn. Along with the man in charge of the contest, there is Fishbot 5000 and another goblin who give out consolation prizes...<br />(can be won multiple times, but only one winner per server, per week)<br /><br />Goal #2: (Consolation Prize) Every 5 Tastyfish you turn into to the female goblin next to riggle bassbait will give you 23 silver<br />(repeatable, can only be turned in from 14:00-17:00 (2-5pm) on sunday's).<br /><br />Goal #3: (Consolation Prize) Bring a rare fish to the Fishbot 5000 to receive &quot;Rare Nat Pagle fishing accessories&quot;. There are three types of rare fish to be found, and yes, rare means rare, I have caught the 3 rare fish on 5 occasions in the last 6 months, so you can catch a rare fish more than once.<br />(repeatable, can only be turned in from 14:00-17:00 (2-5pm) on sunday's).<br /><br />Rewards from doing the Fishing contest/Fishing Extravaganza<br />First Prize (winning the contest):<br />Arcanite Fishing Pole (Requires Fishing 300)<br />A fishing pole (used by Nat Pagle himself!) that gives +35 to fishing.<br />-or-<br />Hook of the Master Angler (Requires level 60)<br />Trinket, increases your swim speed by 25%, Gives UNLIMITED water breathing, and turns you into a &quot;frenzy&quot; fish/shark. Cooldown is only 5 seconds, can be used in combat. DOES NOT STACK with Azure Silk Belt, but DOES STACK with Swim Speed Potions...134% speed swimming for 15 secs!<br /><br />Rare Fish #1 (Dezian Queenfish):<br />High Test Eternium Fishing Line (Requires Fishing 150/Level 10)<br />Use to replace the line on a fishing pole, permanently adding +5 to Fishing Skill to the item.<br />(Must Be lvl 45 to loot, can be caught/completed after the winner is announced, but can only be turned in from 14:00-17:00 (2pm-5pm) on sunday's)<br /><br />Rare Fish #2 (Keefer's Angelfish):<br />Lucky Fishing Hat (Requires Fishing 1/Level 5)<br />Gives +5 to Fishing Skill.<br />(Must be lvl 45 to loot, can be caught/completed after the winner is anounced, but can only be turned in from 14:00-17:00 (2pm-5pm) on sunday's)<br /><br />Rare Fish #3 (Brownell's Blue Striped Racer):<br />Nat Pagle's Extreme Anglin' Boots Boots (Requires Fishing 1/Level 5)<br />Gives +5 to Fishing Skill.<br />(Must be lvl 45 to loot, can be caught/completed after the winner is announced, but can only be turned in from 14:00-17:00 (2pm-5pm) on sunday's)<br /><br />Let the Tournament Begin!<br />Schools of Tastyfish:<br />As soon as the tournament begins, &quot;School of Tastyfish&quot; nodes will spawn all along the coast of Stranglethorn Vale. Yes, the entire coast is in-play with the exception of booty bay itself and Juergo isle (the large one on the east side of STV). The nodes look like small whirlpools, 2-3 yards in diameter, complete with silvery fish flickering in and out. They are visible from a good distance as a shimmering spot in the water.<br /><br />Spawn Locations:<br />The locations of the nodes are fixed. That is, a node is either there or not there, but the locations do not change. You'll find that there is a spawn location approximately every 100-200 yards or so along the coast, so there are many pools forming constantly. The best way to learn them is to participate in the tournament - you'll be lost the first time, but you'll learn them more as you continue to participate each week.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25988</b></h3>How to Catch the Elusive Tastyfish:<br />In order to catch Tastyfish, you must cast your bobber inside one of the fishing nodes. To be on the safe side, ensure that your bobber is at least partially touching the edge of the swirling waters. Ideally, cast it right into the center so you don't have to worry. If you miss, re-cast again. There is no way to guarantee that your bobber will land in the right place. Learn how far back to stand so that the average-distance cast will at least have a chance to intersect the pool itself (stand too close and you'll always overcast; stand too far and your bobber will never make it out to the pool).<br /><br />Once your bobber lands in a good position, just wait and fish as normal. You'll reel in either some Stranglekelp, a Tastyfish, very occasionally a rare fish (very rare) or something else (anything you could normally catch in these waters goes here).<br /><br />Node Mechanics:<br />It seems that the nodes are quantity based, similar to other resource nodes. There are approximately 2 to 6 Tastyfish per node. Once they've all been caught, the node will disappear.<br /><br />Multiple people can and will fish in a single node. Multiple bobbers will clutter the whirlpool and make it hard to click and mean that the hole will be fished out and dissapear that much faster. Generally, that means that you want to skip that hole and find an empty one...I only fish in holes that other people are in if I am certain or at least very sure they just got there, and then I wont get more than 1-2 fish before i mount up and find the next one to stay ahead of the competion thats fishing that node.<br /><br />Changing Nodes:<br />As soon as a node despawns, immediately mount (or hit your speed boost) and proceed to the next most probable location for a spawn. This is something you will learn from experience. If you know a nearby pool despawned 5-10 minutes ago, head there now, as this seems to be the approximate time between respawns.<br />(don't swim unless its unavoidable, you have azure silk belt, swimspeed pots, aquatic form, or already have the hook of the master angler).<br /><br />Things to Watch Out for:<br />There are quite a few nasties along the STV coast if you are around the lvl 40 area. On the southwest side are the highest level mobs in the area, namely varieties of Naga. These are particularly annoying because they wander far (even into the ocean) and have a large aggro radius, are social, and like to net you.<br /><br />The rest of the west coast is (for the most part) inhabited by Crocolisks and Raptors, of which the Crocolisks are by far the worst since they (like the Naga) will sometimes enter the water where you are.<br /><br />The east coast of Stranglethorn, by comparison, is great. The ruins can be a problem if you are below level 40; levels 40 and up will generally be able to walk past without a problem. The one thing you must watch out for, regardless of your level, is the unique level 47+ Elite Giant Gorlash. He roams the shore slowly and is easily avoided, but there are always a disturbing number of skeletons near him when you pass by.<br /><br />And last but not least, if you are on a PvP server, watch out for the enemy. you will hate your life as this event is commonly referred to on PvP servers as the &quot;Stranglethorn Vale Fishing Gankfest&quot;.<br /><br />The Tournament Completed<br />How Long This Takes:<br />Normally the Winner for the week has caught and turned in their fish in less than 30 minutes...about the longest I have seen the contest go before a winner is about 42 minutes. the last two times i won in 24 and 29 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25988</b></h3>Fishing in General.<br />At Fishing Lvl 525 or higher, you will stop seeing &quot;your fish got away!&quot; messages no matter where you go, including the 3 fly-to only lakes in Terrokar Forest which have the highest fishing requirement and best fished items in the game.<br />427 is the highest fishing skill you can have unlured (same as above, but with the +2 fishing skill to glove enchant as well), which makes the in-game cap for fishing 527 with an aquadynamic fish attractor.<br /><br />How to get 527 Fishing<br />375 Base Fishing Skill<br />+40 Arcanite Fishing Pole (+35 from the pole, +5 from putting the High Test Eternium Fishing Line on it for total of +40)<br />+5 Lucky Fishing Hat<br />+5 Nat Pagle's Extreme Anglin' Boots<br />+2 Fishing Skill Enchant to gloves<br />+100 Aquadynamic Fish Attractor (lure)<br /><br />Leveling Fishing:<br />Fishing in even the lowest lvl water can and will lvl you fishing, and even in the lowest of waters like the pond in org, it wil take no more than 14 successful casts to gain a skill lvl. <br />Fishing 1-75 - Learned from trainer.<br />Fishing 75-150 - Learned from trainer<br />Fishing 150-225 - You will need to get and read the Expert Fishing Book that you can buy from Old Man Hemming in Booty Bay on the Lowest level of the town. <br />Fishing 225-300 - At lvl 225 you will Have to go to the islands in Dustwallow Marsh and Find Nat Pagle to get a quest from him to catch 4 rare fish, one for The savage coast in STV, one from the Verdantis River in Feralas, one from the norther Sartheris Strand in Desolace (there are actually two stretches of coast labled as Sartheris strand, you need the northern one that is near the sunken boats), and one from the coastline in Swamp of Sorrows. Upon Completion of this quest, Nat Pagle will give you Master Fishing skill raising your cap to 300<br />Fishing 300-375 - You will need to go get your hands on the Artisan Fishing Book which is obtained from the fisherman at the Cenarion Expedition in Zangarmarsh in the Outlands, just on the bank of the lake.<br /><br />Mr. Pinchy:<br />In the 3 fly-to only lakes in Terrokar Forest, there are a total of 17 Highland Mixed School fishing nodes (3 in Lake Jorune above Stonebreaker Point, 4 in Lake Ere'Noru above Allerian Stronghold, and 10 in the Blackwind Lake/Skettis area.) You will need to have about 480 or more fishing to reliably catch the fish in these lakes...being Furious Crawdads, Goldenscale Vendorfish (that vendor for 6g per! ), Golden Darters, crates, scrollcases, and possibly Mr. Pinchy.<br /><br />(As a side note, Furious crawdads only come from those Highland Mixed Schools, which are used in cooking Spicy crawdad, Which gives you 30 stam and 20 spirit for 30 minutes if you spend at least 10 seconds eating)<br /><br />Just like there the rare fish in STV during the contest, there is a very small chance that you can catch Mr. Pinchy, a rare Crawdad that will have 3 wishes (charges) that give a random effect/item with a 48 hour cooldown from those Highland mixed pools. Mr. Pinchy's drop rate is approximatly 0.2% which averages to about 1 in 500 successful casts. So be prepared to spend alot of time trying to get h im.<br /><br />If/When you get Mr. Pinchy there are 5 effects of the wishes. These are:<br />-Mr. Pinchy's Gift, A gift wraped package that will have 4-5 Super Healing, and 4-5 Super Mana potions in it. (seems to be the most common result of the wishes)<br />-Summon Furious Mr. Pinchy, lvl 70 Non-elite that will attack you and party.<br />-Benevolent Mr. Pinchy, Summons a lvl 70 guardian to assist you in combat.<br />-Mr. Pinchy's Blessing, a 2 HOUR +1200hp buff that lasts even through death.<br />-Magical Crawdad Box, The only permanent, non-consumable reward, a uber-rare non-combat pet (normal white quality, but uber rare because you have to catch Mr. Pinchy in the first place to get it, and then be lucky enough to get him to give you the pet after that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It reads <br /><br />Stranglethorn Fishing Tournament! <br />Sunday afternoon - 2PM to 4PM <br /><br />Fish anywhere along the coast of Stranglethorn (Except for Booty Bay) and look for the schools of Tastyfish that will appear along the coast! Make sure your fishing bobber lands in the school and you will be catching special fish instead of the normal Stranglethorn variety. The first person to catch forty Tasyfish can turn them into Fishmaster Bassbait in Booty Bay for a prize! <br /><br />Even if you are not the first person to catch forty tastyfish you can still turn them in for cash and there are special fish to be caught as well that will reward special prizes!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just stand next to some water and cast. Fishing doesn't level up like most people think it does. &lt;B&gt;As long as your catching something-ANYTHING-your level is increasing.&lt;/B&gt; So don't worry about where you should go at lvl 225 fishing, as long as your consistantly catching fish. You're lvling up. Save your money and don't fish areas you need a lure to fish in. It doesnt make sence! GL to you all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just fish in STV at the stated time, and when you catch 40 tastyfish, return them to the guy in Booty Bay before others do. The tournament is usually won in 20-30 minutes. Check wowwiki for more info.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have a 19 twink rogue, and i want these boots with +cat's swiftness, but im alrdy halfway to 20, when i hand the fish in will i get xp? if so how much?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>* There is no known minimum level to take part, but you must be able to fish the waters of Stranglethorn Vale (with or without lures, 130 to cast, and at least 225 to stop fish getting away ) and fend off the wildlife (up to just over level 40). And on PvP servers, deal with attacks by other players.<br />* The tourney starts at 2pm server (PST). Be in STV at that time for the start announcement.<br />* You don't get level XP, except for the mobs you may or may not have to kill while fishing.<br />* The first person to turn in 40 tasty fish gets their choice of either Nat Pagle's +35 fishing <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Arcanite%20Fishing%20Pole">Arcanite Fishing Pole</a> or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Hook%20Of%20The%20Master%20Angler">Hook Of The Master Angler</a> that turns you into a fish (fun I guess if you already have the pole).<br />* To get any of the other fishing gear, you have to catch rare fish which are caught within the tasty school pools.<br />* You can still fish/turn in all of your tasty fish for the 2 hour time at an NPC in STV. The tasty fish degrade after that so be back in STV before 4pm server.<br />Further information <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Stranglethorn_Fishing_Extravaganza" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Stranglethorn_Fishing_Extravaganza</a><br /><a href="http://wow.toshimo.com/viewtopic.php?t=272" rel="nofollow">http://wow.toshimo.com/viewtopic.php?t=272</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It reads<br /><br /><i>Stranglethorn Fishing Tournament!<br />Sunday afternoon - 2PM to 4PM<br /><br />Fish anywhere along the coast of Stranglethorn (Except for Booty Bay) and look for the schools of Tastyfish that will appear along the coast! Make sure your fishing bobber lands in the school and you will be catching special fish instead of the normal Stranglethorn variety. The first person to catch forty Tasyfish can turn them into Fishmaster Bassbait in Booty Bay for a prize!<br /><br />Even if you are not the first person to catch forty tastyfish you can still turn them in for cash and there are special fish to be caught as well that will reward special prizes!</i><br /><br />Edited, Mon Sep 19 14:25:03 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK i was at one of these during August it was just pure fun people on frostmane know the other faction no one ganked probally a lot of people were drunk irl soo it was awesome</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone know of the rewards yet?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What time zone is this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well,<br />The rewards seem to be things like +5 fishing enchant to pole and the like. I haven't seen anything to get too excited about yet, but that was only the first tourney.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i did this today for the first time, and i can say i won't do it again. i would see people fishing and leave them alone, but if i found a spot, people would come up and just start casting in. in some cases, even standing right in front of you so you couldn't even SEE! at one time, i had 4 other people come up and take over. this is not my idea of fun.<br /><br /> it is a great idea, basically. but limiting the spots makes it aggravating. if it was just wide open where you could go anywhere in STV and fish peacefully, as it is meant to be, it would be great! can you imagine fishing in real life and bumpkins come up and stand on you, get a pepsi from your ice chest and fire up their boom box? <br /><br /> i think it would be funny to have a fish that crawled off your hook, slapped you and jumped back in the water. =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was at the fishing tournament yesterday (EU-Aggramar)<br /><br />It was pure hell...most contestants were level 60 and had epic mounts...<br /><br />So I couldn't keep up as a level 45 with my normal mount.<br /><br />And not to mention the 'fishing spot hijacking'.<br /><br />But i will try again when i'm level 60 and have my epic mount...and show them some sweetness with my Big Iron Fishing Pole :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>When you see:<br /><br />Bob Yells: We have a Winner! Bob is the Master Angler!<br /><br />This is not Bob playing a joke. Someone named Bob actually won. Do not fret though. You can keep fishing til the end of the time limit. 5 of the target fish are worth 20-25s at the quest turn in, and you still have a chance to catch the 3 rare fish that can be turned in for interesting rewards.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jackzer</b></h3>This should be updated to shadowlands. fishing only goes to 200 will the fishing pole still be available?</div>
