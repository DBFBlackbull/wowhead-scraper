<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What is the reagent for each spell?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The reason why this is so sought-after (aside from looking damn-cool!), is that the Gift of the Wild lasts for a whole <b>60 minutes</b> instead of the Mark's 30 minute duration.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So a very nice guild member gave me this book today (Jarret on the Suramar server), and it's a great spell. Saves a heck of a lot of mana and the 60 minute duration time is much welcomed. How does this spell work with raid groups though? Does it buff everyone in the raid or just the people in my 5-man group?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I bought both book 1 and 2 for about 3,5 gold in total in AH.<br />It should be cheap, because only druids benefit from it and most druids get them from guildmates (because they like good druids in groups and instances very well). <br />So only a few guildless druids would be interested. And once they have it, nobody wants it. So low need for the book, low prices in AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got mine for 1G! ah was filled with em highest one up there was still only 3g<br /><br />hehe sucks for not me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It is *mutually exclusive* with Mark of the Wild and has less buff the MofW lev 6, available at 52 (maybe even earlier). MofW6 is 324/14/20, Gift of the Wild 1 is only 240/10/15 (armor/attrs/resist).<br /><br />It lasts longer (60 min, not 30), but usually you have no problems rebuffing at 30 min intervals anyway...<br /><br />I regret money spent on it - should have bought smth different... actually I thought &quot;may be, just may be it is not mutually exclusive&quot;... yeah, right.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was going to buy it from someone in my guild, but he just gave it to me! He's the best! But the only problem is I already bidded on some in AH, hehe...</div>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>
