I had 160 in engineering at the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just used it on my shaman on the matrix punchograph 3005-D and got the discombobulator ray</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The card IS required in order to learn the discombobulator schematic from 3000-D. I can confirm this after spending a couple of hours waiting for this Delta card to drop.&nbsp; <br />Horde engineer, lvl40/230eng by the way</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I confirm that the Discombobulator ray would not drop without the Delta access card. I have 315 engineering (gnome) and the Prismatic punch card and I can't get the schematic from the D punchographs. (haven't found the Delta card yet) I can get the minor recombobulator schematic without it though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The DELTA Card is a Drop.&nbsp; Kill the robots, they seem to drop it.&nbsp; After you get the Card, if your Eng is 160 you can get the Discombobulator Ray from Punch Terminal D.&nbsp; From what I hear it's a rare drop so good luck.&nbsp; I don't know if you need any of the other punch cards, I had them and it worked for me.&nbsp; Oh, this card is NOT soulbound, so share it with your guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can learn two different schematics from the Punch card machines Gnomergan. The first is <a href="http://thottbot.org/?i=15154" rel="nofollow">Discombobulator Ray</a> and the second is <a href="http://thottbot.org/?i=5627" rel="nofollow">Minor Recombobulator</a>. Note that you don't actually get the plans, you are trained from the very console.<br /><br />To learn &quot;Minor Recombobulator&quot;, you must have a Yellow Punch Card and you must have an engineering skill of 140. Simply go up to Matrix Punchograph 3005-B and there should be an option to access hidden schematics.<br /><br />To learn &quot;Discombobulator Ray&quot;, you must have the <a href="http://thottbot.org/?i=5583" rel="nofollow">Security DELTA Data Access Card</a> and engineering skill of 160. You do NOT need any other cards, not even the Red Punch Card.<br /><br />Note that I was on my Alliance Priest when I did this, though I doubt it's any different for Horde, I cannot know for sure.<br /><br />-nathanmx</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This card lets you learn the Discombobulator ray on the 3005-D Machine. You DO NOT need any other cards or anything. The card DOES NOT get used up, AND IS transferrable. Me and another guy just BOTH learned the ray with this ONE CARD.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did you guys ever consider that just maybe that the DELTA card is a replacement for the punch-cards?&nbsp; I have an engineer, and at level 30 with 200 engineering I got both of these schematics, but at the same time I had the punch cards that went with them. <br /><br />For those of you claiming that you can't access the machines, upgrade the punch cards first and see what happens.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So a summary:<br /><br />* Minor recombulator is learned at machine B, no security delta card needed.<br /><br />* Discocombulator is learned at machine D, security card needed<br /><br />security card has a LOW drop rate and is sellable/tradable.<br /><br />End of discussion :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have the Delta key (only engineer in group so I rolled need), and tried it in the D-machine but it gave me the standard &quot;need punch card &lt;whatever&gt;&quot;.&nbsp; We got agro so I had to back off and didn't get a chance to try again.<br /><br />I suspect you need the regular card for the D-machine too (which I didn't have at the time).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a gnome engineer. 152 skill, I think. Level 28. Just did a gnomeregan run.<br /><br />Got the 2nd machine, got the plans from that.<br /><br />Got to the 4th machine, punched it with the normal punch card, no hint of anything extra.&nbsp; Soon after, this card dropped and I picked it up. Ran back to the&nbsp; machine and tried again, and it had the option to learn the plans (of course, it told me &quot;&lt;eng_skill = n3wb&gt;&quot; or something similar).&nbsp; <br /><br />Thus the card is required...<br /><br />I'd like to see a screenshot from someone who says the card isn't required - inventory open, interaction panel with the &quot;learn more&quot; option up on screen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Delta card not required...the prismatic one is and the proper skill level.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to the machines with only 68 engineering skill. Knowing binary I noted that the machine tells you &quot;Go go go!&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can get the Schematics from a Gnome out in the middle of the Wetlands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If any of you guys are having trouble getting this card try killing the Arcane Nullifiers in room before Thermaplugg, they dropped it 3 times on my last trip.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok you can get the first schematic with the normal quest cards. With this card you can get the Discombolater ray WITHOUT the normal cards, but you still need normal quest cards to get the first schematic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Ray must also be a drop because I picked it up really cheap on AH (less than 10 silver) and the other one I got off the vendor in the middle of the swamp in the Wetlands. Level 26 Hunter Eng 165-170 haven't even ran Gnomer with this character, but I saw the DELTA card on the AH and came here to see what it was for.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well i just did it and i had a card with me so get a delta card...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just spent the better part of the day repeatedly going into gnomeregan, killing EVERYTHING there, leaving; just to try and find the card. I couldn't find it? Has the patch got rid of it or is there something I'm not doing right? I am a mage gnome lvl 57 with gnome engineering lvl 268.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Confirming: You need the delta card only for the discombulator.&nbsp; The other one you can get if you have the engineering skill and the white punch card.<br /><br />Confirming: yes you can buy the &quot;Minor Recombulator&quot; schemantic from a vendor in the wetlands for both the horde and alliance.<br /><br />RE: Val's Q's<br />With the white card you goto the punch card A machine.&nbsp; At the bottom of the binary code is the link to get the next yellow punch card.<br /><br />1) the link doesn't show up as a normal quest link.&nbsp; It looks just like a sentance of text but you can still click on it.<br /><br />2) When you click the link nothing will appear in the chat box saying you recieved the yellow punch card but it is in your inventory.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok.&nbsp; I don't know the min's required to learn the ray gun, but my lvl 28 priest (200 engineering skill) just got the card today, and we happened to have been near the last punch-card system.&nbsp; I now know how to make the Discombobulator Ray, I only had the Yellow-punch card at this time also.<br /><br />It looks like you just need a high enough engineering to learn the item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the thing with gnomes is right.<br />I got this drop when i was level 32, with 240 engineering (gnomish) i was also a gnome, so, i think gnomes dont need the card, but i still have it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I understand how this all works and that the card is tradeable, but is it possible for a non-engineer to get the card to drop solo?<br /><br />Like can I go to Gnomer on my lvl 70 to farm for the card and then give it to my engineering character for when it gets high enough to go to gnomer and use the card?<br /><br />basically, can non-engineers get this drop or does it only drop if you are an engineer or have an engineer in the group?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I picked mine up on my 70 mage who is herb/pots, and mailed it to my dranie hunter, np =).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got all of my plans and then rolled need for the card as it popped up when we were leaving so i think u r all wrong bout that. i had both of my plans w/o the card</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Edited, Wed Jun 22 03:25:40 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Any use for this since it requires engineering? Sounds like it opens a door or something.</div>
