    <meta name="description" content="Players can collect items such as Necrotic Rune to turn in for rewards like: Blessed Wizard Oil, Consecrated Sharpening Stone, Tabard of the Argent Dawn as well as increase reputation with Argent Dawn. New 3-piece sets will also be available, which all have very powerful benefits against undead: Regalia of Undead Cleansing, Undead Slayer&apos;s Armor, Garb of the Undead Slayer, Battlegear of Undead Slaying. You&apos;ll want to gather these quest rewards as they will prove to be incredibly powerful in Naxxramas, seeing as almost every boss inside the instance is Undead.">
