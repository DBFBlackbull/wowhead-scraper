I have only ever gotten 3arcane crystals total, in all my mining. to make 2 diamonds required for this&nbsp; that go for such widely varying prices is ridiculous. The Azerotian we need is now 20-25g &amp; the Pristine goes for i'm being told after asking around goes for 200-500g. I've never even seen one drop. The SIX arcanite bars are now 60-75g each. The arthas tears are around 2g each. <br /><br />The lady in SS wants 50g + 20 Enriched Mana biscuits form the east PL vendor. <br /><br />Not only will it cost more, but it is going to be almost impossible, bec no pristines are evne avalable to buy. i would buy the regular epic now if i could get all my money back. All i need is the pristine &amp; i dont have nearly enough for that now.<br />The least they could've done was give us som warning as to wahat we'd need, to try to start getting the stuff. Bliz can bite me. was is that hard for the undead to get their Badass epic mount? Don't think so</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Its also used for the pally epic mount quest, some moron put one up on my server for 600g. If you don't know, the money required to get to the point in the quest when you need this is 350g, not to mention a lot of other expensive items like arcanite bars and such. Who would think somebody is gonna pay over 950g for their epic mount? Just goes to show the epic greed and idiocy on my server anyway</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if peopel keep trying to sell em for 900g why not spend an extra 18g and get a normal epic mount it is rediculous on Khadgar server at one point they were going for 500-600g each now it dropped to 200-300g thank god cuz pallys would have to spen way over 1000g if u buy one for 900g its insane.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sold one of these for 20G on Daggerspine a few weeks back and have seen them be completely sold out more often lately. Seems like perhaps they're being grabbed up while still cheap in anticipation of their potential use for jewelcrafting. Although I'm also often seeing these for around 2G in the AH as well. Figure it's just players who don't care or realize they're possible future value. Wonder if the price will truly ever rise and stabilize? Nevertheless, I'm betting that these will go up markedly in value as the release date for the expansion approaches.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Jun 6 11:46:21 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Worth 900g? Of course not, I hate how people ridiculously overprice these things, sure some are needed for pally epic mount quest, the new 58+ shaman quest and librams which lead to rather subtle underpowered results for the networth of a reagent the price of a BoE Epic. <br /><br />Gotta hate how farmers control the economy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate for these babies has been increased immensly since Zul Gurub came out, because almost everyone needs one to make some of the class set armor that you can earn with Zandalar faction. opn my server the average price has fallen from over 200 each to about 20-30 last I looked at them. I got mine from a scarlet strat run for free though, I was a happy paladin.</div>
