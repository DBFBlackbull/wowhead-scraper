If I decide I want some linen cloth, I had better be able to give the defias a shakedown and get it, and having earned my level 60, it better be safe and easy to do, even if I just want to grind up first aid. Otherwise what is the point of levelling.\n\nAs it is, as a Druid, to get any XP I have to die all the time. If I need trade items, I had better be able to go someplace where I can kill stuff and not die.\n\nAlso, FYI, changing the payout and not changing what it promises to pay, is fraud.\n\nThey already nerfed soothe animal which hurt druids, so I can't walk peacefully through the woods anymore. I have to fight wolves all the way. Thats not very druid like. Apparently they changed it because someone was using it in an instance to get to the boss. Hello? Why not change the instance so the boss calls everything to help him? In this case, they should have lowered the drop rate on the electro lanterns, is all, or left them alone. Its not as if the venture mining camp is safe, happy place.\n\nI'm getting VERY disappointed by these changes Blizzard makes that are over-heavy and that are done without informing us properly or addressing the actual problem.\n\nThe level 50 people could kill tons of tigers now anyway and farm heavy leather. And why not? If they can kill stuff they earned the leather. And other drops they can sell to npcs. Other level 50s will still make more money in instances, so I dont get the objection.\n\nOh... and since someone decided people needed 100G to get a mount.. and 1000G at 60, I wonder why people need to farm money. Its not gold sellers, its people who, like me, made it to 45 and didnt have mount money. They have plenty of ways to track and stop gold sellers without spoiling the game's fun for the rest of us.\n\nAt launch, this was a fun game. If they keep changing things.. I dunno.\n\nAnyway my experience at 35 as druid, was that if other players weren't there, I'd die a lot. Its ok for Pallys and Rogues etc that can blat things, but as a druid, getting an add when you're fighting two goblin surveyors, is death.","date":"2005-02-07T17:30:20-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Cherreia","importedSubject":"Dont nerf everything!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":3011355,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I had these things frop of the geologists yesterday, and I am a lvl 35 priest...","date":"2005-01-25T03:29:29-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"uybros","importedSubject":"not nerfed"},{"commentv2":1,"number":6,"id":3011356,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"they sell for 66 copper each now with honored faction","date":"2005-01-16T18:30:45-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Senlawin","importedSubject":"nerfed"},{"commentv2":1,"number":7,"id":3011357,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I wondered about this since they didn;t change the price listed before you actually sell it.\n\nThis is a classic example of why they need to make it so if the creature is grey to you, it drops NOTHING on death(except a quest items).
