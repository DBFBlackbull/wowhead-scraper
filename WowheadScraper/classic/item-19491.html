Although no mobs consistently drop rugged instead of heavy leather, the percentage of rugged leather drops seems to be significantly lower from mobs 55 and below. Sure, you can combine 6 heavy leather to make 1 rugged leather, but that means your farming efficiency is being cut by about [b]85%![\/b]\n\nSecond, avoid farming mobs with junk drops like chimera leather, warbear leather, or thick scorpid scales on their drop tables. These items (like hides) drop [b]in place[\/b] of regular leather, and they drop frequently, so they also put a BIG dent in your farming efficiency  (these items, which are only used to make a couple of items, were obviously included in order to cut down on the amount of regular leather entering the economy).\n\nThird, the best place I found to farm rugged leather is the Ice Thistle yeti caves just east of Everlook. Don't bother with the regular yetis (mostly 53-55) outside the caves, go inside (where a high percentage of spawns are matriarchs and patriarchs L 56-58) and farm to your heart's content. I found with 3 hours of farming I could get about 160 rugged leather -buy another couple of stacks to make it a round 200, which is enough for 40 kits = 100 tickets.\n\nFinally, I would recommend avoiding the temptation to farm plaguebats in EPL or scorpids in Silithid on the theory that you can get both leather and bat eyes \/ glowing scorpid blood. The drop rate of the eyes and blood is quite low, the scorpids often drop scales instead of leather, and the bats drop a high percentage of heavy instead of rugged leather. Also, the scorpids have a nasty poison that will result in significant downtime unless you have a lot of nature resistance.\n\n\n\n\n[i][small]Edited, Nov 30th 2006  4:37am by BlueKominto[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-11-12T04:03:56-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"BlueKominto","importedSubject":"Advice for Leatherworkers"},{"commentv2":1,"number":55,"id":3077302,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I farmed this last year for my shaman, before patch: grind silithus for glowing scorpid blood. Takes ages. Now i grinded this for my rogue as well, but much faster!\n\nBest strategy:\n- get 130 vibrant plumes, this is 1\/4 of the amulet. EASIEST to get! You can do 26 turnins at the darkmoon fair, after this your rep is to high (when getting tickets, start with handing in vibrant plumes, duh). Where: the cave with harpies in thousand needles (west of freewind post). Vibrant plumes drop fast, and with average gear this will take you about 2-4 hrs. \n\nAfter this get the rugged armour kits \/ glowing scorpid blood \/ evil bat eyes.\n\n- grind silithus for glowing scorpid blood, while skinning all mobs. Goes very fast. Very good idea is, if you have to grind 1\/2 levels, do it here. This way you can grind while working on the darmoon amulet. \n\n- do UBRS runs and try to be the only skinner. UBRS you need anyway for your gear \/ quest and each run will give you about 60 rugged leather. \n\nUsing this strategy I was suprised how easy it was and how fast it went!\n\nTip: create a mule, the stuff takes up a lot of space.\n\n\nEdited, Fri May  5 03:23:04 2006","date":"2006-05-05T08:29:09-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"rectori","importedSubject":"best strategy"},{"commentv2":1,"number":56,"id":3077303,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"This is a good necklace for an Enhancement Shaman too.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, you need 480 Rugged Armor Kits, for Leatherworkers. <br /><br />Skinners: I suggest going to Winterspring.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a miner and a skinner, I turn'ed in all Rugged Armor Kits and Dense Grindling Stones without changing my professions.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Now that you can turn in Rugged Armor Kit, Dense Grinding Stone or Thorium Widget for tickets no matter what profession you are! I think there are hardly any other necklace comparable to it at this low price!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tickets required for amulet: 1200 <br />Number of tickets rewarded per quest: 20 <br />Widgets required per quest: 6 <br />Thorium bar required per widget: 3 <br /><br />So you will have to do the quest 60 times (1200 tickets required / 20 per quest), giving up a total of 360 Widgets (60 returns * 6 widgets). The total number of thorium required to make all the widgets will come to 1080 thorium bars (360 widgets * 3 thorium bars), for a total number of 54 full stacks of thorium. <br /><br />On my server a 20 stack of thorium cost about 6g. This quest will therefore cost me 324 gold. To find the price for an amulet on your server, look Thorium up on the AH and mulitply the average cost of a stack with 54. <br /><br />You will also need 360 runecloth (18 stacks) but you can't go outside Ironforge/Ogrimmar without getting a bag full of Runecloth from random mobs. <br /><br />If you have 16 slot bags (Journeyman backpacks) you will have to fill two whole bags with Thorium Widgets, plus four more slots in another one. <br /><br />If you are an engineer you can make widgets with a skill of 260 or greater. Widgets will level engineering all the way from 260 to 300 (green from 290). I dinged 300 engineering after making no less than 110 widgets. <br /><br />You don't have to be an engineer to deliever the Thorium Widgets, so an alt or a good friend can make them for you. The tickets are soulbound, however. <br /><br />The link to the quest itself: <br />Alliance: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=-321">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=-321</a> <br />Horde: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=-301">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=-301</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Howto grind 1200 tickets grinding:<br /><br />1. Farm 125 Vibrant Plumes from Thousand Needles' Arpies. These will grant you 300 tickets and 2500/300 neutral reputation.<br />2. Gather 450 evil bat eye (from bats)/ glowing scorpid blood (from scorpids) from Eastern Plaguelands / Silithus. These will grant you 900 tickets...<br />for a total of 1200.<br />Sometimes you can find these items in AH also for 1 gold each... (50s vibrant plumes).<br />Happy farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've found out that gathering the bat eyes, the glowing blood isn't that easy at all. Just grinded 2 hours in the burning steppes on the blood and only got 10 of them :(. So i tried another path.<br /><br />Thorium bars grinding is time expensive therefor this is no option for me. Grinding rugged leather is the easiest way but you need it the most :).<br /><br />Taking a chance on buying my way in the tickets. Rugged leather can be bought per 10 for 1g10s or 1g25s. For 8 rugged armor kits you require 40 rugged leather which means 5g per 20 tickets.<br />300g total<br /><br />Buying thorium bars on Sunstrider isn't as cheap as been written above. That char could buy them for 3g per stack i have to pay at least 6g per stack and 2g for the runecloth.<br /><br />If possible take on the rugged leather yourselves or make sure you have 300g too spend. And dont wine that its time consuming all great things are :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im a dps warrior i like the agility and extra stats. im an armorsmith/miner, i went to silithus where the scorpids are a plenty and killed mass quantities since 10 blood = 20 tickets and while i was there i mined all the fast spawning small thoriums which often gave me 2-3 dense stones a pop (4 dense stone = 1 grinding stone, 8 grinding stones =20 tickets too). It did take a while but i just got mine in a few weeks for nothin it takes time but the trash drops off the scorpids and mobs in the area sell decent and the repair bill is low. i also managed to get my epic mount in this time too, silithus is the place to be for tickets to me.I recommend going for the turn ins that give u the most tickets it makes farmin alot faster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Feralsoul</b></h3>For those who are on the Classic adventure and so happen to be a Feral druid, this is <i>the</i> necklace to get prior to raiding or throughout raiding. Wonderfully itemized, something you can solo and not need to roll on, and is extremely hard to replace. There are very few necklaces better than this but the downside is obvious, that this is going to be a time sink.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm not so sure it was worth the 2,400 Rugged Leather (about 240g) to get though. The test server version was what I thought I was getting. Ah well....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So, assuming you're a 60 hunter.<br /><br />The stats on this necklace would give you:<br /><br />38 AC (If 2AC = 1 AGI)<br />29 ATK (If 2 ATK = 1 STR + 1 AGI)<br />105 HP (If 1 STA = 10.5 HP)<br />~3/4 of 1% chance to dodge (If 26.5 AGI = 1% chancew to dodge)<br /><br />I currently wear Will of the Martyr (10 STA and 30 ATK), so really farming scorpid blood for a month would only yield 38ac and a slight chance to dodge, and take 1 Atk power.<br /><br />Am I missing soemthing? Or is it time to sell off my stacks of scorpid blood? That is, if 38ac isn't worth it to me. I think the time involved, if you have little spare time is not worth the reward when there are easier to get. However, good luck if you want this, or are a class than can better benefit from it.<br /><br />I suppose the mintue I sell my blood do they will add stats to it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a skinner/leatherworker, I farmed multiple things for this amulet:<br /><br />125 vibrant plumes (sky shadows in deadwind pass), made several gold each run off the grey bits plus a ton of food buffs (from wings and giant eggs). The drop rate is also 33% so if you can beat the bots I recommend this for the first 25 hand-ins (23 for humans), as you lose the quest after that.<br /><br />40 glowing scorpid blood (scorpids in silithus and burning steppes), mostly acquired while questing in those lands. Not recommended, since their drop rate is 20% (6% for BS) and heavy scorpid scales drop more than the rugged leather does.<br /><br />256 rugged armour kits (dragons in burning steppes, yetis in winterspring and plaguebats/hounds in epl). The yetis have the best drop rate for the leather, plus they carry silver and possible high-value grey/green drops (and I got a purple hehe), the bats also carry the eyes plus grey bits.<br /><br />90 evil bat eyes (noxious/monstrous plaguebats in epl), also made a fair bit of gold off the grey bits. Although the bat eyes have a 15% drop rate, the rugged leather drops are fairly good if you stick to the 54+ mobs, and you can also kill the plaguehounds for the leather (and they also drop wolf meat for food buffs). It's probably worth farming these if you're questing there or grinding strat/scholo, if not then it's up to you to choose between farming 2 sources of tickets at once or farming 1 source with a better drop rate.<br /><br />(Tip: create a bank character to hold them all before you start and give them 3 slots in the bank as well as a full set of 14-slot bags. If you're into pvp then set your hearth to your farming spot, join the av queue and farm while you wait. By the time you're out of av your hearth will have cooled down ready to repeat)<br /><br />Now I'm just waiting for the fair to hit goldshire next month...<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 25th 2006 2:37pm by Footpadd</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 25th 2006 2:39pm by Footpadd</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I thought I'd post this here so others could avoid a headache.<br /><br />After deciding to collect scorpid blood for the amulet I learned something about the nature of sillithus. Each mob in a given region will spawn as 1 of about 3 things. <br /><br /><b>***IMPORTANT***</b><br /><br /><b>If you go around killing only scorpids, soon there will be no scorpids!<br /></b><br /><b>***IMPORTANT***</b><br /><br />When the faire is in town on my server, with a 5:1 ration of alliance to horde, you can walk across gnomes and night elves from one end to the other without touching the sand. All of which selectively pick scorpids and race around on their mounts. Then when I clear an area of spawns they swoop in and scoop up all the scorpids and leave.<br /><br />So, maybe you don't know how the area works, now you've been warned and have no excuse. <br /><br />pick an area: kill everything, wait for scorpids.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>5 Months in Real Calendar time. 940 tickets earned by true skinning and making kits. Last tickests rugged leather bought from AH (=50G) and then to Faire to<br />get Amulet. <br /><br />And next rugged leathers goes to Argenta Dawn reputation quests.... Oh dear.<br />no end for grinding</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>in mulgore faire... it's worth about 600 evil bat eyes for 1200 tickets... thats 120g if u had sold to an NPC =[<br /><br />60 herb/alch sham<br /><br />why the hell couldnt they just give me some herb gathering quests! Those bat eyes take me about an hour for 10 eyes.... thats only 20 tickets!<br /><br />Edited, Wed Sep 7 20:56:00 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't see how this item isn't worth the effort. This is a fantastic rogue neck piece..one of the better ones I've seen. And considering you only have to give up 200-300 gold (if that, for farming the materials for the tickets) to get this item I can't pass this oppurtunity up. I have seen less on AH for 500+. Even though I missed this month's faire I started my farming now for next month. <br /><br />Edited, Wed Sep 21 19:02:42 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I bought 1000 thorium off the AH for around 250g and made all the thorium widgets i needed, took about oh 7 mins to make the 300 odd widgets. Turned them in and got the amulet, A TON better than actually faming all this crap.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got the bulk of my tickets for this by farming rugged leather to make armor kits. For what it's worth here's what I'd recommend: first, if at all possible, farm mobs level 56 and above. Although no mobs consistently drop rugged instead of heavy leather, the percentage of rugged leather drops seems to be significantly lower from mobs 55 and below. Sure, you can combine 6 heavy leather to make 1 rugged leather, but that means your farming efficiency is being cut by about <b>85%!</b><br /><br />Second, avoid farming mobs with junk drops like chimera leather, warbear leather, or thick scorpid scales on their drop tables. These items (like hides) drop <b>in place</b> of regular leather, and they drop frequently, so they also put a BIG dent in your farming efficiency (these items, which are only used to make a couple of items, were obviously included in order to cut down on the amount of regular leather entering the economy).<br /><br />Third, the best place I found to farm rugged leather is the Ice Thistle yeti caves just east of Everlook. Don't bother with the regular yetis (mostly 53-55) outside the caves, go inside (where a high percentage of spawns are matriarchs and patriarchs L 56-58) and farm to your heart's content. I found with 3 hours of farming I could get about 160 rugged leather -buy another couple of stacks to make it a round 200, which is enough for 40 kits = 100 tickets.<br /><br />Finally, I would recommend avoiding the temptation to farm plaguebats in EPL or scorpids in Silithid on the theory that you can get both leather and bat eyes / glowing scorpid blood. The drop rate of the eyes and blood is quite low, the scorpids often drop scales instead of leather, and the bats drop a high percentage of heavy instead of rugged leather. Also, the scorpids have a nasty poison that will result in significant downtime unless you have a lot of nature resistance.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 30th 2006 4:37am by BlueKominto</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I farmed this last year for my shaman, before patch: grind silithus for glowing scorpid blood. Takes ages. Now i grinded this for my rogue as well, but much faster!<br /><br />Best strategy:<br />- get 130 vibrant plumes, this is 1/4 of the amulet. EASIEST to get! You can do 26 turnins at the darkmoon fair, after this your rep is to high (when getting tickets, start with handing in vibrant plumes, duh). Where: the cave with harpies in thousand needles (west of freewind post). Vibrant plumes drop fast, and with average gear this will take you about 2-4 hrs. <br /><br />After this get the rugged armour kits / glowing scorpid blood / evil bat eyes.<br /><br />- grind silithus for glowing scorpid blood, while skinning all mobs. Goes very fast. Very good idea is, if you have to grind 1/2 levels, do it here. This way you can grind while working on the darmoon amulet. <br /><br />- do UBRS runs and try to be the only skinner. UBRS you need anyway for your gear / quest and each run will give you about 60 rugged leather. <br /><br />Using this strategy I was suprised how easy it was and how fast it went!<br /><br />Tip: create a mule, the stuff takes up a lot of space.<br /><br />Edited, Fri May 5 03:23:04 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a good necklace for an Enhancement Shaman too. Its abount 1% crit, 100hp (well needed by Shaman)and adds dps with the 10 strength. <br /><br />Also - there would never be any moaning from rogues or hunters for rolling on &quot;their&quot; necklaces. You would have earned this all by yourself without annoying anyone.<br /><br />If you had Emberfury Talisman its perhaps not worth it, but remember for PvP Enh Shammy, spirit is all but useless. If you have the gold lying around then why not eh?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For a shaman this would give:<br /><br />+100 hp (+105 if you're a tauren)<br />+0.95% crit<br />+0.95% dodge<br />+38 armor<br />+20 attack power<br /><br />You get less out of this necklace than most other classes, but it's still worth it imho.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Gotta a few question about this quest if anyone wouldn't mind answering.<br /><br />What level am I able to do the 1,200 ticket turn in (Not use it, that's pretty obvious = P)? Do I need a certain faction level to do it?...and if I do, will the 60 Thorium Widget turn-ins needed for 1,200 tickets get me to the appropiate faction level?<br /><br />Planning to farm for all the Thorium and Runecloth on my main which is a miner, send that to a friend to have him make the Thorium Widgets, which in turn I'll send to my alt which is going to take up Engineering just long enough to turn in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Most of the time when im grinding something for some certain armor piece or weapon it seems a very unfair amount of work. This wasnt nearly as bad as i first expected.<br /><br />Started my warrior alt and grinded him to lvl 60 with 14d gametime. Bought Elementals deck too. :) Grinded 90 Scorpid Bloods and 10 Evil Bat Eyes and got bored of those mobs and their skills.<br /><br />Changed profession to Skinning. Grinded it to 300 in about a day, little over i think. Then grinded the rest mats for the Darkmoon Tickets in less than a week.<br /><br />Didnt spend a dime on the material for the quest. All grinded during the about 1,5 week perioid. Id say i got about 200g atleast as money drops and vendor trash. Loads of greens and one blue weapon. Also same time mining in the grind spot for Thorium which i got about little over 100 bars because of the competition on the veins. Also 5x Arcane Crystals and 2x Azerothian Diamonds. So all and all good deal.<br /><br />If youre not in a raiding guild as i aint i recommend going for this if you want to max your stats before the big drops.<br /><br />Oh i grinded at the yeti cave in Winterspring...little ways of Everlook. The cave spawns one small thorium vein and one rich thorium vein at the same time. So good proffs would be Skinning and Mining. If you get lucky theres some other one killing the mobs too that aint a skinner and the work goes even faster.<br /><br />Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Back to epic rating on the test server. You can do the safe thing and wait, having to pay a little more for the turn in mats, or gamble and buy them at their cheaper, regular price now. Ya I'll wait too....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can you turn-in Dense Grinding Stones if you aren`t blacksmither ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As of <b>January 9th, 2006</b>, this prize is once again epic with the same stats as listed in the image above!<br /><br />My trick was to skin everything in Zul'Gurub then buy a little here and a little there off the Auction Houses. Winterspring (as well as the Burning Steeps) made an excellent farming ground for the last yard. (I'd like to thank two of my friends for the help in donating a few stacks of Rugged Leather, too)<br /><br />Also, it might be wise to create an alt to &quot;mule&quot; the parts and/or crafted items while you gather. Fills up about a bank and two 14-slot bags.<br /><br />Final note: Each turn in quest gives 100 faction. I quickly rose from Neutral to Friendy. At Friendly the profession-specific quests were all available to me. It might be wise to gather enough animal parts to reach Friendly then petition friends and guildmates for Thorium Widgets, Rugged Armor Kits, and Grinding Stones to get the 1200 tickets needed for this wonderful necklace. (My non-leatherworking friends were unable to do the Rugged Armor Kit quests while at Neutral. It has not changed.)<br /><br />I am very happy with mine and am proud of the work it took to get it!<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jan 9 13:26:41 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>why is anyone argueing about &quot;who should get this necklace&quot; its a freakin quest who ever completes it should get the necklace plain and simple</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got mine today. It only took me about a week and a half of light farming and about 250g. I farmed the harpy feathers, and got 120 in about 4-5 hours of farming. I also had 20 Glowing Scorpid Blood and 20 Evil Bat Eyes that I had got while questing, and the rest was Rugged Armor Kits. I bought most of the rugged leather, and the rest I got on LBRS, UBRS and ZG runs.<br /><br />Great necklace for a feral druid. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Silly question: Does this have anything to do with the proffession ur character currently have or can u just buy the materials and turn it in for the tickets?</div>
