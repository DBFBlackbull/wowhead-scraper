I'm a swords specced Rogue and I am also an enchanter who has learned the formula. I can honestly say that i prefer this enchant to crusader as a rogue. Firstly lifestealing has a proc of something like... 25%. I would say it procs 4-5 times per fight meaning it does 120-150 damage and heals you for 120-150 life on average. It's a great boost in DPS and it also helps your survivability.\n\nThe reason I'm not big on Crusader is because it gives a boost in strength. Strength, I find does not help nearly as much as agility which is why i wouldn't bother wasting my money on it again. It heals for approximate the same amount as lifestealing would if it procced during a fight, but the proc rate is far lower than that of lifestealing and so you can't count on it as much.\n\nIf you compare lifestealing to +5 dmg on 1h weapon, we can see that lifestealing is superior. 25% chance to proc means 1 of every 4 hits on average is a proc. +5 dmg means you need 6 hits to do 30 damage and lifestealing means you need 4 hits (on average) to do the same damage. And as a bonus it heals you.\n\nAs a rogue in an instance, dual lifestealing enchant and dual instant poison on weapons or dense sharpening stones means a hell of a lot of damage.\n\nAs for a twinker, the 30 damage \/ healing boost is huge since lower levels have much lower health than level 60s. And since low levels do not have many talent points at their disposal to upgrade their skills, this will make all the difference.\n\nThere is a reason why this formula is blue and crusader is green.

If you swing more times in a fight you have more chances for it to go off then someone who only swings a few times.    <<< or like some people on this page were saying .... will a slower weapon be giving some special higher proc rate because of it being slower or do all weapon speeds share the same percent to proc chance.   i've tested with fiery plenty of times and the more hits you could get in the more times it would go off because you had that many more chances for it to proc.      so does this mean a 5 % proc rate in a fight that has 10 swings will proc more times then a fight with a 5% proc rate with 5 swings","date":"2005-12-21T15:00:48-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I would most certainly wager that all proc percentages are multiplied by a number based on the speed of the weapon (i.e. a weapon with a speed of 1.3 would have a multiplier of .7, while a weapon with a speed of 2.6 would have a multiplier of 1.3, etc).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7968</b></h3>This is an awesomely fun enchant for PVPing. <br /><br />But, if you have some decent gear, and need something to grind with, I'd suggest duel-wielding two Skullforge Reavers and enchanting them with this. You'll gain so much HP as you attack that you'll have close to NO downtime.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4336</b></h3>You can get this solo as a rogue by sneaking in and killing the spectral researchers. I did it on my lvl 60 with average gear, and i havent been raiding with him. I used some pots like winterfall firewater and instant poisons.<br /><br />You can stealth all the way and avoid all the other mobs. Jump down from the bridge at the beginning where the 4 skeletons are. Open the doors and stealth all the way around to the room where the spectral researchers are. Be sure to wait for the patrols. When you finally get to the room, the easiest one to kill is under the stairs. Theres another one patrolling but its harder to kill without aggroing other mobs.<br /><br />It took me about 10 runs to get the formula. It was worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1497</b></h3>Although this enchant is fun, it's really not worth the mats. I'd suggest the CRUSADER enchant (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20034">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20034</a>) instead. It heals for 100 (lifestealing is only compbined of 30 + 30 = 60), and it grants 100 strength, which does more than 30 more damage (not per hit, but per proc).<br /><br />And it's cheaper.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10048</b></h3>This is a great enchant for any class. Obviously better for some than others. What seemed the most useful to do though is to enchant a my main hand weapon with cruisader, then go for life stealing on the hand.<br /><br />The lack of down time is great. Pvp action even better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>frmrpreztaft</b></h3>While crusader may heal you for more and give a strength proc, lifestealing procs CONSTANTLY. I barely go more than 3-4 swings without a lifesteal. <br /><br />It's really a matter of personal preference. Lifesteal on twink rogues at 29 or 39 is brutal, because it also damages your target.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10215</b></h3>One of the rarest enchants in game, took me about 160 Scholo runs to get it - and it dropped from the very last ghost that run.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25685</b></h3>I think that the drop rate must have increased recently because I picked up 4 of these in 4 straight runs soloing scholo for gold.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did a parsing with this as a test :<br />Subject : Level 60 rogue<br />Weapons : <br />Heartseeker w/ Crusader (mainhand)<br />vs.<br />Heartseeker w/ Lifestealing (mainhand)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />(no offhand weapon )<br /><br />In 3 separate tries vs. lvl 55-56 mobs for 10 minutes per trial,<br /><br />Total damage w/ Crusader enchant was more <br /><br />Total healing w/ Crusader enchant was more<br /><br />Proc rates were about the same, with crusader being 1.8% lower than lifesteal in how-often it proc'd, but even with this lower rate it healed more and contributed more to overall damage than the lifestealing enchant.<br /><br />Glad we did the lifestealing test first, so when crusader turned out to be considerably better we didn't have to re-enchant again ;P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This does not place a dot on the target. It is an istant 30 damage 30 heal. It can be partially resisted. It can be entirely resisted. It has a better proc rate than crusader. However, crusader cannot be resisted.<br /><br />Again, this DOES NOT put a debuff on the target. I don't know where people got the idea that it does.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does having a +damage to shadow spells have any effect on this or other shadow-based procs?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have this enchant on both of my weapons. I'm a swords specced Rogue and I am also an enchanter who has learned the formula. I can honestly say that i prefer this enchant to crusader as a rogue. Firstly lifestealing has a proc of something like... 25%. I would say it procs 4-5 times per fight meaning it does 120-150 damage and heals you for 120-150 life on average. It's a great boost in DPS and it also helps your survivability.<br /><br />The reason I'm not big on Crusader is because it gives a boost in strength. Strength, I find does not help nearly as much as agility which is why i wouldn't bother wasting my money on it again. It heals for approximate the same amount as lifestealing would if it procced during a fight, but the proc rate is far lower than that of lifestealing and so you can't count on it as much.<br /><br />If you compare lifestealing to +5 dmg on 1h weapon, we can see that lifestealing is superior. 25% chance to proc means 1 of every 4 hits on average is a proc. +5 dmg means you need 6 hits to do 30 damage and lifestealing means you need 4 hits (on average) to do the same damage. And as a bonus it heals you.<br /><br />As a rogue in an instance, dual lifestealing enchant and dual instant poison on weapons or dense sharpening stones means a hell of a lot of damage.<br /><br />As for a twinker, the 30 damage / healing boost is huge since lower levels have much lower health than level 60s. And since low levels do not have many talent points at their disposal to upgrade their skills, this will make all the difference.<br /><br />There is a reason why this formula is blue and crusader is green. Think about it. If you are interested, send me an in game mail. Name: Citizen. Server: Eredar. I charge 5g and you bring the mats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It steals 30 hp. It procs a lot, 6 times more than crusader from what ive heard. Curse of shadows and locks shadowboltcrit affects the dmg. It is best for sword rogues (dagger rogues should enchant 5 dmg on mainhand and 15 agi on off, for warriors crusader is much better) I got it on my vis'kag and it owns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If there is anyone that still doesn't know about procing of this baby!<br /><br />Let's take 1.9 AS sword, and 3,8 2H axe for an example. As this is 6 procs per min on average, u get 6PPM regardles of weapon speed. I don't know why you should go after 1.3 daggers? Ok, with 1.9 hit 31 times in 1min (if none are dodged/parried/missed/bloceked), with 3.8 u hit 16 times. With fast one it proces on every 5 hit (average), where on slow one it proces every 2 or 3 hits.<br /><br />Here's the table for easier understanding. <br /><br />1.9AS ....0....0....0....0....0....0. (31 hits in 1min)<br /><br />3.8AS . . 0 . o . . 0 . . o . o . . o (16 hits in 1min)<br /><br />. = hit<br />0 = LS proc<br /><br />Hope i wrote it in the way, so even the noobest players can get it :) Ow corect me if i'm wrong.<br /><br />I have spoken</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>Crusader</b> has a proc rate of 1 Proc Per Minute<br />Crusaders heals for 75-125, therefore 100 average.<br />That means you will have an average heal of 100 per 60 seconds.<br /><br />Therefore, crusader has 1.66 Healing per Second.<br /><br />Crusader also increases Strength by 100 on average once per minute, giving Rogues a 1.66 Damage Per Second boost as well.<br /><br />Also, the damage benefit of Crusader is also mitigated by armor, resulting in damage returns of even less than this.<br /><br /><b>Lifestealing</b>, on the other hand, as a proc rate of 6 Procs Per Minute. Each time it does proc, it heals you for 30 and does 30 damage. <br />So, 6(PPM) x 30(Damage)= 180 Damage Per Minute.<br />Divide that by 60(seconds in a minute), and you get 3 DPS. Almost twice that of Crusader.<br />This same formula applies to the healing aspect of Lifestealing, giving you 3 HPS as opposed to Crusader's 1.66.<br /><br />In summation,<br />LS= 3 DPS, 3 HPS, <br />Crusader= 1.66 Dps, 1.66 HPS<br /><br />However, Lifestealing can be resisted, and some do prefer the slightly higher burst damage of Crusader over the sustained higher benefits of Lifestealing.<br /><br />All in all, I prefer Lifestealing to Crusader for a Rogue any day of the week.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can do this on brozebeard horde side<br /><br />i used it on myself on a slow weapon, HIGHLY woudlnt recommend doing it on a slower weapon, since theres a higher chance of stealing life with a faster 1 hand weapon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this from a Spectral researcher in Scholo.... the procs seem to be great for end game alliances... but i cant see how one or a couple of players could justify the expenditure to have it on their chars... I am a rogue and as soon as i got it wanted to sell it to the nearest.... lol my alliance guys... that way all the mats are covered by a load of players and the enchant can be smacked on to a load of beneficiaries... thru guild bank (BTW 500g lol)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I decided to farm this, it dropped off second researcher first run solo, then the second run it dropped again off same guy, later with a buddy it dropped two times in a row as well of the same guy but diferent from earlier... 4 drops in one day WTF?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>update on this formula took a friend into scholo to get formula must have done room 40 times no drop think it has been changed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First of all...this enchanting form is damn near impossible to get. I've been trying to get it for weeks now, only 6 Spectral Researchers in Scholomance, so not many chances to get one to drop unless you convince a group to just keep resetting the instance. <br /><br />Secondly, this enchant is best for Rogues. Duel wielding daggers, both with this enchant, and a proc % of like 30-35% for 30-35 health per proc (PER DAGGER), makes this very Rogue friendly. <br /><br />The key to this enchant is SPEED. I've tested Crusader and for dagger using Rogues, I would say add Lifestealing to both and you will be very pleased with it. IF you can find someone on your server with the formula.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is the drop rate influenced by whether ur in a raid group or not? my guild is tryin to get this enchant and we've been resetting the instances and killing these punks for weeks... should we be doin it five man?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just a thought i'm interested in getting this for my rogue. If you have a fast weapon that swings 2 times faster then a slow weapon. Wouldnt you have 2 &quot;chances&quot; for the proc to hit compared to 1 &quot;chance&quot; on the slow weapon. Procs hit on percentages right. so lets say its a 5% proc rate on lifestealing. the fast weapon would get 2 swings that each have a 5 % chance to proc. the slow weapon would get 1 hit in with the same 5% chance. So it seems if the proc has no memory and always has the same chance to proc on each and every swing. If you swing more times in a fight you have more chances for it to go off then someone who only swings a few times. &lt;&lt;&lt; or like some people on this page were saying .... will a slower weapon be giving some special higher proc rate because of it being slower or do all weapon speeds share the same percent to proc chance. i've tested with fiery plenty of times and the more hits you could get in the more times it would go off because you had that many more chances for it to proc. so does this mean a 5 % proc rate in a fight that has 10 swings will proc more times then a fight with a 5% proc rate with 5 swings</div>

Of course, the Pally I play with is my RL girl friend, so she wants enchant on a Destiny. Is it worth it? It would be replacing an Icy enchant, so it must be better than that, but Destiny is slow.

The LS dmg is instant and does not require an &quot;open&quot; window that may take some time attacking to see the Crus dmg become higher overall. Especially seeing a lower proc rate with crusader the chances get smaller to benefit.</div>
