    <title>Nostro's Compendium of Dragon Slaying - Item - Classic World of Warcraft</title>

    <meta name="description" content="Foror&apos;s Compendium of Dragon Slaying is one of the rarest books that players can loot from books scattered around the different wings of the Dire Maul dungeon. Looting or purchasing Foror&apos;s Compendium of Dragon Slaying off the auction house and bringing it to Lorekeeper Lydros in Diremaul is the first step to obtaining Quel&apos;Serrar, a fantastic tanking weapon for Warrior tanks and Protection Paladins. After speaking with Lorekeeper Lydros, the player will obtain Unfired Ancient Blade which must be dropped on the ground and hit by Onyxia&apos;s flame breath ability during p3 (after she lands around 30%). Once Onyxia dies, the player must loot the blade again and use it on her corpse to treat the blade. Finally, bringing the Treated Ancient Blade back to Lorekeeper Lydros will award the player with Quel&apos;Serrar.">

The same thing warriors use it for. Tanking. Agreed, in an instance situation a warrior would get more use from it.

I'm sick of gimping my paladin because people are unwilling to believe that we need good gear beyond healing and mana. I solo alot, gathering resourses, soloing quest ect, ect, and I would really like a weapon that helps me dish out some damage so it doesnt take 20 minutes to kill one infernal. I tried using a 2hander (peace keeper) but I need the block and armor from the shield too much for the pole arm to be viable. I'm also sick of the argument: \"if you want to do dmg roll a warrior! zomfgnoob!\" No. I like playing the pally, I like to support my group and guild by healing and buffing and off tanking when it's necessary. But like I said, in a soloing situation I want to do as much damage as I can so it doesnt take forever to kill one mob. BTW I got the book on my second DM run off of the Magistrate.

The best time to drop the sword is when onyxia is around 10% health at the Main Tanks feet so it will get breathed on. 10% health with 25 or more people still alive and an out of combat rezzer is an assured victory unless someone gets tail whipped into the welps. Phase 2-3 transition is when you lose a lot of folks so if the sword is down and you wipe, you are out of a sword untill 5 days untill the instance resets.\n\nJust my two cents\nDags\n\nEdited, Wed Aug 31 15:08:37 2005","date":"2005-08-31T18:57:18-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"dagsy","importedSubject":"When to drop the sword"},{"commentv2":1,"number":68,"id":3065157,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Lol warrior book? this is BOTH warr and pala book, cant u read? im pala and if you by any chance think im not gonna roll, you are sadly mistaken, that is an awesome sword","date":"2005-12-03T05:32:52-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"lol, cant you think ?

I was so surprised when everyone rolled Need on it.  A druid won the book.  He has a 60alt warrior alt and said he would give the book to his alt.  In my opinion, his alt was not in the group so I should have first priority to have the book.  The other classes needed so they could give to their guild warriors or sell it.  Does anyone else think that this was wrong?

It's a great tank weapon and would be very nice to give warrs an attainable epic, like hunters/priests and their MC loot items.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8067</b></h3>This is not worth the trouble in my opinion...I farmed DM more hours than I can count and never saw it drop even once. If you have the money, it is a great sword like the above posters said, but don't plan on it dropping the first time you go in there if you want to farm it. Plus with timeworn mace you *should* be able to hold aggro in Molten Core. Once your guild gets into BWL Maladath or Spineshatter becomes available and you won't need Quel anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vayn001</b></h3>I don't know, it seems as if maces are tough to tank with. Maybe its because most of them have a bit longer of an attack speed then most swords. Obvisouly Maladath is a good sword, and a good looking one at that, but usually if your nice rogues should get priority on it. There are quite a few nice swords and daggers for rogues in BWL though. (Dragonfang Blade), (Chromatically Tempered Sword). But as for the Quel'Serrar, if you have the time to farm it, then so be it. I as a tank would probably roll need on it, and then after winning it, get the urge to sell it for an epic mount or a few pieces of Fire Resistance gear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9296</b></h3>Atlhough this is a great tanking sword, nowadays many high end guilds run hard, but to them easy, instances like MC and BWL and sell the items that drop. Unless you see one drop, you are better spending your money on a sword from MC or BWL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>daseth</b></h3>Item droped for me while in group in Dire Maul, droped from Pusillins when you have to fight up , we had 2 Warriors in group and we are in the same guild. We both needed on the item as being only items for this. After I won this I spoke this over with him (btw he is the leader in the guild) and said me and him both are dec'd in Arms, and this book would only give us a sword (me) which i could prolly replace down the road with something better, as we are both in Arms. So I am now selling this book, profits are being split between me and him and the guild, to help other lv40s get their mounts when the time comes, if anyone is interested i am DaSeth on The Forgotten Coast msg me..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ya i think after u get this epic book to drop..u go turn it in and get some sword and u ahve to go kill onyxia and have her breath fire o nthe sword and then stab it in her dead body.. and u get that 52 dps epic sword... yep pretty sweet</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The book says right on it Warrior or Paladin...or maybe people just can not read - what say you?<br /><br />I have this book.&nbsp; Found it in DM heading to the Captain.&nbsp; Thought about selling it - but I think that would not be a good idea.&nbsp; Turned it in - to start it.&nbsp; I'm pretty jazzed.&nbsp; Actually, the quest starts off by saying something about greed and how you could have sold it for a lot - lol.<br /><br />Anyway - the quest is pretty damn near impossible.&nbsp; A lot is going to have to go right in order to get this one finished.&nbsp; And, a lot of effort.&nbsp; And I think the server you play on will play a bigger factor than anything else.&nbsp; That and how much in the loop you are.<br /><br />Well worth it for either class if you ask me.&nbsp; And if you do not need it, you can always bank it for a toon or guild member who may need it down the road.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I didn't bother reading all your pointless garbage posts, but just in case anyone is still wondering how this book works, I'll explain.<br /><br />First, you get the book. That's probably the hardest part right there, since it's such a fkn pain in the ass to get ahold of. It's sold on my server 4 times, each time for well over 1000g. (Yes, I know there are 3 0's there). <br /><br />You then take the sword and equip it during an onyxia fight. You must be HIT by one of her Deep Breath attacks. Anyone who's ever fought onyxia just cringed when they read that.<br /><br />It's an AoE funnel spell that's basically 2000 dmg every second. It HURTS. It's pretty much her &quot;i win&quot; button. Thankfully, she only casts it once or twice a fight, and only during stage 2, so it's easy to avoid. Just get your group on either side of the cave, and if you need to get hit, make sure a healers healing you.<br /><br />After the sword has been properly &quot;flamed&quot;, you have 20 minutes to kill onyxia.<br /><br />If you have gotten onyxia to the point where she has deep breathed and 20 minutes expire before you see her at 0%, all 40 of you need to hearth and never ever ever go back.&nbsp; She should deep breath around 50%, and getting her to land is easy after that, then stage three needs to go by fast before she goes into uber dps mode anyway. <br /><br />Once she's dead, right click her corpse to finish off the quest and TA-DA! You have the best 1h sword in-game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well ive been farming this book for about 3 weeks now, doing west, north, ALOT of east, then started farming Tomes in West (im a warrior). after about 3 days of farming the tomes I made around 700g selling the class books and this book dropped =)<br /><br />You hear alot about ppl saying this book is so hard to find bla bla bla. but the ones who find it rarley post about it, so dont give up hope!<br /><br />Crafted the sword the day after the tome was found =) laid it down at 15% then MT lost aggro on Onyx at 10%, luckily the aggro stealer turned out to be another warrior who taked her for the rest of the fight =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The tomes are still around but they are rare. I normally only find one out of 10 runs or so if I am lucky in DM North. I've never found them in any other wing of DM but I'm not saying they don't exist there either. The tome I always find is where the King is at. Everytime I have opened the tome I get lint and some fishermans book. Worthless but thats ok. I finally broke down and bought the book from the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>3-4 full runs of west, north or east everyday and a few farming runs of the west bosses a day for the last month and almost 2 weeks. On weekends i run 8-10 hours of west and east boss farming runs. I have made over 1400g off the drops and shards i have won from randoming and still no drop. Im also going for bloodlords defender and it never drops either. 2 months since my guild has seen it drop. Its driving me crazy i cant get either of these 2 weapons.<br /><br />This random drop and low drop rate BS blizzard pulls is just plain frustrating. <br /><br />I have asked 3 other warriors in IF that have a QS and a few pieces of valor and not much else how they got it. All 3 said they got it on their first run in DM and had a friends guild help them kill onyxia. Meanwhile im putting in 4-5 hours a day everyday for over a month and i still dont have this sword. Just seems stupid to me. Blizzard needs to figure out a new method of distributing loot other then random drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>DM West Tomes: <br /><br />The solo farmable tome is in the very first courtyard, when u enter into the instance (the left door to DM west insatnce) walk over to the wall on ur left and look staright north. <br />Get a set of Ornate Spyglasses and use them in this position, press crouch button so u can get a better overview. <br />You will see 2 benches and 3-4 tree mobs walking around (tome guards) the tome is a red book lying on the ground where they walk, between the deer and bear statues. you WILL see it if its there (roughly 1/7 resets have it). If u cant even see the tree mobs u will have to turn your Terrain Distance up in the Video option a little. <br /><br />when u see the tome, run to the tree mobs, avoiding all patrols, fear them and loot quick then haul ass out of the instance and reset it. <br /><br />hope this helps some <br />I was wondering are you still able to farm this first dusty Tomb in DM west?</div>

I also said it but wish I never did since he is my irl friend.<br /><br />Anyway the priest won and now its on AH for 1000gold.<br />All in the group said warrior should get it but the priest wouldnt let it go so its at AH.<br /><br />I dont like this situation and the warrior should get it not matter what its worth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What do paladins use this sword for? The same thing warriors use it for. Tanking. Agreed, in an instance situation a warrior would get more use from it. But I'm sick of people saying &quot;why do pallies need that?&quot; &quot;why the f--- did that pally get that item?&quot; We are plate wearing melee classes as well. I'm sick of gimping my paladin because people are unwilling to believe that we need good gear beyond healing and mana. I solo alot, gathering resourses, soloing quest ect, ect, and I would really like a weapon that helps me dish out some damage so it doesnt take 20 minutes to kill one infernal. I tried using a 2hander (peace keeper) but I need the block and armor from the shield too much for the pole arm to be viable. I'm also sick of the argument: &quot;if you want to do dmg roll a warrior! zomfgnoob!&quot; No. I like playing the pally, I like to support my group and guild by healing and buffing and off tanking when it's necessary. But like I said, in a soloing situation I want to do as much damage as I can so it doesnt take forever to kill one mob. BTW I got the book on my second DM run off of the Magistrate. The warrior in the group already had it, and I was the only other one who could have used it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What's the standard if this drops in PuG?<br /><br />I mean, you obviously have a tank, which is most likely warrior, but the item isn't bind on pick, it's not even bind on equip or bind on use.<br /><br />If it's a guild run the guild will already have already chosen whatever they feel like but if it drops in a PuG anyone in the group could grab it and sell it for the load of gold it sells.<br /><br />The frigeen thing does not bind so you cannot &quot;demand&quot; that the person equips it on site to soulbind it instead of selling it at AH.<br /><br />What to do? All roll and if the warrior wants it he'll have to buy it from whoever won the roll?</div>

The best time to drop the sword is when onyxia is around 10% health at the Main Tanks feet so it will get breathed on. 10% health with 25 or more people still alive and an out of combat rezzer is an assured victory unless someone gets tail whipped into the welps. Phase 2-3 transition is when you lose a lot of folks so if the sword is down and you wipe, you are out of a sword untill 5 days untill the instance resets.<br /><br />Just my two cents<br />Dags<br /><br />Edited, Wed Aug 31 15:08:37 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've got one on my level 60 pally, warriors need to stop crying about it. It's not &quot;The best tanking sword in the game&quot;, Thunderfury, or Maladath are better choices ( while yes Quel IS &quot;easier&quot; to get as you don't need to be killing broodlord for it. It's a great solo weap ( I'm not a fan of 2h weapons on my paladin ) and awesome for PVP/Duels. It's a great weapon for both sides for non-raiders and raiders alike.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I admit, it is a better sword for warriors than pallys. Let's face it my fellow light bringers, there are other weapons out there that better enhance our survival abilities. For instance, anything that increases our intel or the amount we heal. And like it or not, 90% of the time our function in a group is to heal. Were this to drop and I was the only eligible person, I would most definitely try to get the sword. However, I will not take this out of the hands of a warrior whose primary job is to tank and keep the aggro away from the less durable healers. They need it. We just want it. If you take this out of a warrior's hands because you are greedy and not thinking of long term strategems, I can do nothing but shake my head at you.</div>

Sure its a nice weapon when you start MC but after that you get better and its a waste. It's for paladins or warriors, everyone is so greedy. Paladins can go get a better weapon, the AQ exalted 1 hand mace, Aurastone, Bloodcaller, or Jindo's are all good for guilds in zg or mc and warriors can get bloodlords or their own AQ exalted 1hand axe.

Everyone i know has either farmed 100+ times and not gotten the drop, or got it in under 10 tries. I've not heard many people say &quot;I farmed 100+ runs and FINALLY got it.&quot; Is there some posibility that there is some sort of factor needed to get this to drop, like Deathcharger from Baron Rivendare, you gotta have at least one person exalted with AD, so the numbers on thott and allakhazam are skewed with all those who kill him without the rep.<br /><br /> Is there any sort of rep or prereq quest you have to do before this can drop?

If we look at what blizzard them self say about the paladin class, they say that the paladin is PRIMARILY melee as well as a support class. Hence, once u wipe we need something decent to clean up the mess u leave behind. And don't give me that crap about the stats. We all know that stamina is for ALL classes, especially paladins, warriors who are the tank/cleaners in the game. And before u start whining about the defense and armor, HELLO, we can use shield and extra armor and dodging/parrying never hurt anyone, so Shut ya piehole cause the next warrior to complain will be a big dumbass and we all know u wouldn't want to be that would you.</div>

I am a 60 pally and when i saw the book I was so excited because I was the only person that could use it in the group. I was so surprised when everyone rolled Need on it. A druid won the book. He has a 60alt warrior alt and said he would give the book to his alt. In my opinion, his alt was not in the group so I should have first priority to have the book. The other classes needed so they could give to their guild warriors or sell it. Does anyone else think that this was wrong? I agree that the sword would be better in the hands of a warrior or MT, but as a pally I would love to have this sword becuase I often use the sword and shield combo as an off-tank when I am in a group if I am not needed for main healing. I feel that the rest of the group were ninjas for Needing this item. Let me know your opinion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>what u gotta ask is..... <br /><br />Do u paladins ever melee in raids?.... therefore would u benefit from this sword?<br /><br />by all means if u buy the book then fair play, but if u outroll a warrior on it saying u need it ........ :S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm on horde side, so im lucky theres no stupid pallys :D<br />But still i suffer from hearing that paladins outroll warriors on this book.<br />Lets see, a warrior (like me) would use this sword 99.9% of the time playing, while a paladin would use it just a few times a week(maybe not even that much). So all you paladins really should pass, if a warrior needs it.<br /><br />*** Flame Incoming ***<br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 14th 2006 at 1:30am EDT by knobblett</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got a 60 warrior on skullcrusher named kitsun and im currently farming for this. <br /><br />For all the pallies who roll need just ask for all the +defence gear they already have. A warrior could go all strength/stamina gear for dps just like pallies can go +intel and +healing. If they say they left all that gear in the bank just laugh and take the book. before you know it there gonna leave the sword in the bank too. If i meet a paladin who actually needed it i wouldnt be pissed it he actually won it. Id just think it a waste. No taunt = no tank in my book. And using it in duels just shows the rest of the world that you got problems. <br /><br />Always go ML your mildly retarded if you expect people not to ninja.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Look, at the item. /look at item<br /><br />It reads Classes: Warrior Paladin<br /><br />This MEANS that Paladins and Warriors can use it. Enough said. So my question is, &quot;Why would Warriors care about a Paladin needing on it, if the item specifically says they can use it?&quot;<br /><br />Answer: B/c Warriors are the largest Loot-Hogs in tHE GAME! Go do MC (which can be just about 10 manned now up to Domo) and get some good gear, and Kwitcher$%^&amp;*in over this little toy of an epic.<br /><br />LOL @ all Meat-wall Tanks. Takes real smarts to roll toon that just has to set there and watch his life go up and down till the target is dead. Boring lazy bunch of waste!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I cant believe i still read this argument all the time...pallies just heal ...warriors just say that because they cant, and any attempt by a pally to infringe upon thier one and only job makes a warriors penis shrivel. Are warriors better at tanking Big Instance boss mobs , yes ... who picks up the adds? can a warrior compete with getting AE aggro on mobs with a pallie , no!...so how how come a sword that procs a armor buff isnt for them also..get real...if protection specced and with righteous fury maxed , pallies now have 6% more damage mitigation than b4 ..that may not sound like alot to you, but enchanted with a lifesteal proc and a pally using seal of light ,you would be surprised how long they stay upright. Furthermore, people can play thier classes any way they wish...i know for a fact as a 100% protection specced paladin that i out tank many fury /arms warriors...as i have been grped with them and watch them lose aggro over and over, and guess who comes in and saves the day...paladin. Would i ever roll on a shield with just stam str and agility with warrior in grp if he needed , no , i wouldnt ..but thats because im nice and i can benefit from other shields with intell, but a sword ffs..every melee class needs one ...are pallies only supposed to take the real low dps ones with intell and spirit ad plus healing on them ..hell no ..ill sacrafice 12 intell +20 healing for +15 dps and and a 300 armor bonus proc anyday</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Honestly...this thing drops pretty often now. <br />Price dropped from 2000g to 1000g...there are 2 or 3 in the AH every day. <br /><br />Maybe it's the new Eye of Shadow.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i was outrolled by a paladin on a need roll for this. i had hoped that he would actually use it. but no, 30 mins later i see it on the AH. its price was higher than the others =/ dumbass or what?<br /><br />(also play a 60 warrior, terenas)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my opinion, paladins really shouldnt be allowed to roll on it. I mean, sure, its a good dps weapon.. but what paladin ever tanks in Molten Core? =/. <br /><br />Secondly, i'd like to groan about the price of these things. They really aren't worth the 1500g they are being sold at. Why not just go to Zul'Gurub and pick up a Bloodlord's Defender instead? It really doesnt make sense..<br /><br />Malekith (60 warrior, Terenas EU)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OMG i am so tired of all you warriors whining about paladins being able to use this weapon. If a paladin is allowed to wield a one handed sword, then they should be allowed to roll on any sword or take any sword that they can, and since no swords in game have any pally stats on them, this is the only epic one hand sword a pally can have, unless they grind silithus for 3 months and get the sword from that quest. So give us pallies a break, its not like we only heal things. We also solo in our spare time and we need decent weapons to do it. Did you know that paladins are tanks when they solo? and they are also healers. So we have the most difficult job out there. So stop your frickin complaining!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>STFU stupid pallys!<br />This is one of the best tanking weapons (FOR WARRIORS) IN THE GAME. You dont exactly need the quel sarrar, niether do you need a shield like bloodgod. Tanks need them way more then you, and you owe it to them that they use all their cash on trying to get this sword, without them you probably wouldnt ever even get a chance to see something like the aegis of the bloodlord drop!<br /><br />And just because you can weild it, dosnt meen you have a right to get something.<br /><br />Hmph... so there :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yesterday this thing dropped in DM east, i was the only warrior so i rolled &quot;need&quot; on it. and the paladin say he needs it too, so he rolled &quot; need&quot; too, so it was a fair roll, then after i was gonna buy it off him, and he said he was gonna give it to his guild's MT, or sell it on the AH&lt; i was like wdf : are u like abusing the system&quot; u only roll need when u need it, and not for money or give it to someone eles . and i was there and i needed it . <br /><br />AND THAT SWORD IS A WARRIOR SWORD&lt; PALADIN CAN GET THOSE ONES THAT + intellect, spirit, and all those other crap, or mana generation<br /><br />+ defense and armor is for tanking not healing &lt;&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone knows if the drop rate of the book has been nerfed or something? i haven't seen this in like 2 months, detheroc, alliance side.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well it must be said and i dont give a rats ass what u pali's &quot;think&quot;, true you get a protection tree and you make decent tanks in 5-10 man INSTANCES. Probably with the exception of Baron, Scarlet-Strat and Scholo, palis can generate the most threat....2 problems. 1) Palis use this thing called mana to tank, it regenerates at a rate FAR slower than rage, and once its gone...yeah, where as warriors constanly generate rage, not to mention abilites and taunts that instanly diverts agro to us. 2) When the heck have you EVER seen a pali MT MC, BWL, Naxx......never! Learn you role and shut ur mouth, im arms furry and i can easily take tha aggro of palis and druids. In end game palis are off healers, decursers, and seldomly damage dealers. Sure before that you can do whatever but in end game, know ur role or roll a different class. Oh and FYI i have a pali and i would NEVER think of rolling against a warrior for it, if i ever won it with him I'd put it up on AH. (and im sure some palis are gunna get all butt hurt and cry sayin dood ur a noob stfu we have tank tree, well MT Rag, Nef, Ony and end game and we'll talk)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm so fecking sick of every time I check an item which both pallies and warriors can use, all the comments I find is argues between pallies and warriors. Look, endgame: Pallies heal, otherwise, they can rape as much baron Riverdare as they want. Warriors tank or dps at endgame. Pallies just heal.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 23rd 2006 10:31pm by Vronning</i></div>

Must be extremely rare since I haven't heard of many people getting it from those books.</div>
