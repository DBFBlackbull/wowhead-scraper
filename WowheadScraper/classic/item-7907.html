I did not have any trouble getting adds inside.\nI single killed the mobs that wandered the stairs on the first level, and on the seconed level,(the level with the patroling casters anyway) I just stealthed behind those 2 until I got to the stairs that lead to the Final Level. I didn't have to sap the named, he just stood there while I took the journal out lol. He's an observant one, isn't he?\n\nThe only complication I had, was obtaining the key from the guard. That also took timing and watching the mobs pathing. \n\nYou need to watch the other patrol group and then watch where the Guard roamed, see where he stops and watch how long he stays there before he turns around and walks back again. Each time I did it, he walked half way around the tower, on the left side (facing the entrance inside).\n \nI also noticed that each time that I did it, the best time to distract and pick pocket was when he was behind the tower just before he paused, the pats were no where near that area at the time.\n\nHe also despawned on me once or twice after a few moments of failing an attempt, did anyone else have that problem? Or do they make him reset so others have a chance to pick pocket incase someone was successful at it? =P\n\nAnyway, hope this helps some.","date":"2006-07-17T11:10:22-05:00","rating":31,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"just pickpocket him for the key.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>for now it only exists as a diploma yes.&nbsp; The quest is designed to prepare you for the next rogue quest which involves picking a lock in a tower located in SE Westfall.&nbsp; Hold onto it though, you never know, they may add a quest in the future that requires you to prove that you are a certified thief =).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Apparantly its one of the steps toward getting poison abilities:<br /><br /><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/WoW_Rogue_Class/b22782/79871250/?3" rel="nofollow">http://vnboards.ign.com/WoW_Rogue_Class/b22782/79871250/?3</a><br /><br />I guess the next step is to go to Klaven's tower.&nbsp; Search for Klaven for more information</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To complete the tower quest,the certificate is not needed.IMO it will be used in a later quest.Or it's just an useless item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I really doubt this serves a purpose aside from general amusement.&nbsp; Just destroy it.<br /><br />I also doubt they'd add a quest that uses it since all the rogues that long ago destroyed it would be entirely shafted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>maybe they will use it as a required quest item to reward those who bothered to keep it ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You dont train poison, you do a quest. Klaven's Tower, which is got from agent Kearnan outside the tower in westfall. There is a quest to go to Kearnan and then she gives you Klaven's Tower. Then you pickpocket the dude wandering around outside for a key, stealth upstairs, watching out for patrols and then you either kill Klaven (probably impossible at level 20), sap him (also probably impossible), or have a friend either kill him or sap him, and then open the chest. Theres also a way of hiding behind the chest or something to open it and Klaven doesn't see you. Leads onto another quest to do with a curse.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i did this at 20, the only hard part was taking the key, sapping was easy then you jump down and run out. simple.<br /><br />Mavana - 20 Rogue - Uther</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>trash it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The tower is pretty simle even though its crawling with guards, sneak up on them, and use ambush, they die in 1 hit EVERYTIME, and if other sports u doing while you make the kill, run for it, and whne they return to tower, go back in, and stab the next one. The boss on top is also easy, sneak up sap him, and pick the chest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The tower isn't nearly as hard as you might think, just use your rogue abilities of stealth, pickpocketing, and sap the elite at the top before opening the chest, and you'll do fine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im not sure if only an enginere could use these but if you having trouble with the tower simply sneak to the top then use a target dummy open the chest and run like hell. Ive seen it work at level 20 very easily.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, I read these posts a few lvls after I completed it, (seeing if anyone found any use for the certificate yet =P)and it appears I had an easier time than the others had.<br /><br />It all really depends on your timing. I did not have any trouble getting adds inside.<br />I single killed the mobs that wandered the stairs on the first level, and on the seconed level,(the level with the patroling casters anyway) I just stealthed behind those 2 until I got to the stairs that lead to the Final Level. I didn't have to sap the named, he just stood there while I took the journal out lol. He's an observant one, isn't he?<br /><br />The only complication I had, was obtaining the key from the guard. That also took timing and watching the mobs pathing. <br /><br />You need to watch the other patrol group and then watch where the Guard roamed, see where he stops and watch how long he stays there before he turns around and walks back again. Each time I did it, he walked half way around the tower, on the left side (facing the entrance inside).<br /><br />I also noticed that each time that I did it, the best time to distract and pick pocket was when he was behind the tower just before he paused, the pats were no where near that area at the time.<br /><br />He also despawned on me once or twice after a few moments of failing an attempt, did anyone else have that problem? Or do they make him reset so others have a chance to pick pocket incase someone was successful at it? =P<br /><br />Anyway, hope this helps some.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It might appear to be useless, but why trash it on the off-chance? Put it in the bank, and if you need it later, it's there. Would be a shame to trash it, and then find out it's needed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>after reading the above posts, I do believe that it varies at what skill you may pick his box at. I was not able to pick his box until I had hit 100 in lockpicking- which was VERY annoying I might add...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I discovered that there's not a complete guilde to finding the lockpick skill but if you search enough you'll find enough on the subjuet to get you started.<br /><br />The Lockpick skill is offered as a skill from your trainer, from there you want to go upstairs to visit the SI7 guys for a quest to <u>speak with Lucius in Redridge (not the Mill)</u> he's on the dock and he gives you a quest to get a tolken out of his personal box at the Mill north of town.<br /><br />when you get to the mill you should already have a lockpick tool on you, there you'll find grey metal box's on the ground and you'll want to right click the box's till you get to skill 80 in picking, then try Lucius's box. <br /><br />After you get the tolken go around back, there should be a chest with goodies on the corner. Now take the tolken back to him for the certificate. As far as I can tell the certificate is a deploma and nothing more, but just to be safe stick it in the bank for safe keeping....you never know if you'll need it later.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
