<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'd like to know if it's worth running UBRS time and time again for that wee book to drop. Is it really that much of a difference? I ran UBRS over 100 times (yes, I counted them) for the Shadowcraft tunic. It took me 2 months. They were all Pickup Groups. I dont feel like going UBRS ever again, but then again I can't afford to buy it for 500g :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The drop rate seems to be a lot higher than the listed 1%; I'll do a few runs and hopefully get one...god knows with full NS I don't need anything else in that craphole.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dont bother looking at the thottbot droprates, they most likly include all the kills people have recorded of the blackhand assassins total not just since the patch was released.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ran UBRS twice today and 3 books dropped. Also got Shadowcraft chest on the last one :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It seems the thottbot drop rate is wrong, probably because so many of these mobs have been killed before this came out, and its only calculating the ones that have dropped including all the mobs pre-patch.<br /><br />Got a 60 rogue and another one im leveling atm. Can anyone give me an accurate drop rate of this? without bulls*iting. thx<br /><br />Cozza - 60 human rogue - Draenor</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got mine last night first run through. Droped off the Assassins right after The Beast.<br /><br />SC Tunic droped too so now I can complete my Darkmantle quests.<br /><br />It was a good night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1)Don't buy this book .Don't waste your money.Why not?<br /><br />-98% the guy who sells this is a rogue who told to the party that he needs it but he has the book already.<br /><br />-1.9% a ninja warrior/lock/mage/hunter or whatever.<br /><br />-0.1% no rogues or a rogue with the manual at the party and someone won this in greed<br /><br />So 99.9% the seller is a ninja.Don't buy the book and go in ubrs to get it.Ubrs its a very easy instance 2-5 runs and you will get it.Let ninjas put this book in their..<br /><br />PS:in few weeks when almost everyone will have the book you wont have to pay more than 100g to&nbsp; get it.Don't make ninjas ritch</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have done 25 runs, have seen the book drop twice and both times it was won by people who could not use it. Since the second time i have done nothing but run my own runs and have master looted everything after rend as a result.<br /><br />In the time i have been farming for this book I have seen the following eipcs drop in UBRS:<br /><br />2x Chromatic carapace (That's right, TWO)<br />Elemental mage staff<br />Skullflame shield<br />Brain Hacker<br />Blade of Shrazz (or whatever its called, 2h epic from general)<br /><br />6 epics and i still don't have that book.<br /><br />All the people talking about 3 dropping in 1 run should realise how lucky they are, The two that i have seen both dropped really early and i am currently sitting on about 20 dry runs in a row.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got invited to kill Drakk in UBRS last night.&nbsp; Came in while fighting mobs just outside Drakk room.&nbsp; Book drops, I win over other rogue (hooray).&nbsp; Then to top it off, SC chest drops (I've run UBRS like 30 times and never seen it drop).&nbsp; I said a quick prayer, rolled need, nailed a 99.&nbsp; I felt bad for other rogue... but not too bad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ran 10 runs in a week and only saw one druid book drop. Not one manual. Not good.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've only run UBRS maybe 3 times since this book became available, but I picked it up today while we were getting a few more guildies Ony attuned.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ran with the guild about 10 times and haven't seen it drop.&nbsp; I think at this point I'll just wait till it's trainable with the expansion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>tonight running ubrs my first time. I was but a&nbsp; lowly 58 rogue and there was a 60 rogue in group. This dropped so I was reluctant to let him have it, only to have it drop AGAIN off the next mob for my taking.<br /><br />I could not make this up if I wanted too, this dropped back to back on my first run, oh and I also got a Shadowcraft tunic as well...go ahead call me a liar, but who has a nice new book and tunic!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it was among the end loot items. I had the 2nd highest roll, the first highest chose some crappy belt, which he probably wouldn't get more than 15 gold for it. Guess he didn't know what the book was worth. Oh well... I got the book and sold it for 400 gold.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i bought rank 9 eviscerate from rogue trainer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got Manual of Eviscerate IX,<br />was about to mail it to my rogue, who didn't learn Eviscerate9.<br />But then I figured out you can vendor Manual of Eviscerate IX for 10G, and rogue can learn at a lower price at trainner.<br />So just go get 10g, not bad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ive done two ubrs runs today and yesterday seen it drop each time.I got it the second time, was lookin forward to selling it till i read the posts above. thanks again blizzard :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>2 Runs yesterday 4 runs today. Guess how many drops? Yes you're right exactly 0.<br />However druid book dropped once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sold one for 700g. I just got my epic mount. Glad I didn't have to farm Tyr's Hand or w/e for endless hours..And it looks like the price is gonna fall probably to the price of librams soon. Glad I sold it before then. ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can't say what the drop rate is as I managed to get it the first run, though only one dropped out of the 8-10 assassins.<br /><br />Did instructor raz the night after patch with rank 8 and was buffed to 1900 AP and ripped off a 5 point eviscerate for 2675 and a non-crit for 1419. I have 3/3 Imp evisc, 3/3 Aggression, and do not have deathdealer's 5 piece.<br /><br />So, with rank 9 eviscerate and 1900 ap its perfectly possible to hit a 3k crit with it.<br /><br />Average raid buffs (1400-1600ap) I was regularly criting for 2200-2400. AP scaling and new rank make it much more worth it to use it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First run (Horde): 3 rogues, 0 Books.<br />Second run (Horde): 1 rogue, 2 books.<br /><br />Both of my rogues will be very happy now, I got one before the beast, and one after when the sneaky one comes out of the tunnel.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Today i found one on the Vek'Nilash Alliance AH for 200g. didn't hesitate to buy it. Right now i've put it back on the AH for 499 bid and 550 buyout.. already had a 300g offer...<br /><br />maybe ill even train my rogue the manual... (she's level 39 only now tho)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i was in UBRS with some guildie just now and a guild was like: nhea nhea we got the manual :D <br /><br />and FIVE SECONDS later our group got it as well. <br />The chance to drop must be something like 3%-6% <br />Its a new rank but blizzard made it so every rogue could get it trust me :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So what's the damage range for this baby? Can anyone confirm an amount?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>where can you find those mobs? ubrs, lbrs or both?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have done 11 runs now and 1 book drop. When is Blizzard going to realize people have better things to do than farm for crap like this. Allow us to train it at the trainers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It droped today for me on the 2nd assassin.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Possibile to buy it(trade channel or AH for example)?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Picked up the manual in UBRS pug in loser lotto, sold it for 1000g. Looks like the drop rate was significantly raised, glad I sold it when I did, most likely will go down in price very soon.</div>
