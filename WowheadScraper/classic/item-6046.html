I noticed that there are some effects and abilities by creatures in Warcraft that will disarm you without actually saying you are disarmed.  One of these is an effect that the Bloodhound Mastiff from Blackrock Depths has.  It's an effect called Expose Weakness and it acts like a typical disarm.  I can confirm that by using a weapon chain, you are immune to the effect.  The combat log will not show it as being immune.  It will show that you resisted the effect.  Just wanted to clarify this.  \n\nYes, the weapon chain does act like a typical enchant so it will overwrite any current enchants you have.  Alot of people don't like droping an enchant on their weapon.  I personally will never fight without one anymore.  You only need it on your main hand weapon.  Currently I am using a weapon chain on my main hand weapon and a Demonslaying enchant on my offhand wep.  Works great in that first part of Dire Maul. =)\n\nLooks like this is starting to show up more as I see them for sale in the AH on Stormrage. They actually don't sell well at all.  Most times I can't even sell them for 2 gold.  One time I just started to offer to install some for free just to empty my bank a bit.  Even that didn't get rid of any of these.  Oh well, that's what you get for playing on a PvE server.  \n\nMany thanks to Darkflame for making this post possible...\n\nShallow\n60 Undead Rogue Stormrage\nFor the Horde!","date":"2005-05-06T00:22:06-05:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SincerelyShallow","importedSubject":"Some Info"},{"commentv2":1,"number":28,"id":3021720,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"it have 0.00000890 drop chance lol! farming unreal=(((((((((((( i neeeeeeeeed them!","date":"2005-09-01T13:37:13-05:00","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Zlodeische","importedSubject":"=(("},{"commentv2":1,"number":29,"id":3021721,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Just found this today wile farming Fairnbanks with my druid.\n\nI gave it to a guildie smith and found out it was more rare than epics hehe.\n\nCount that luck.","date":"2005-07-05T13:31:58-05:00","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Teodo","importedSubject":"Got it 5\/7-2005"},{"commentv2":1,"number":30,"id":3021722,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Just got one off a dustbelcher of some type in badlands, selling it on dark iron server, name is bilf or Arong","date":"2006-12-23T16:51:57-06:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"arong","importedSubject":"plans"},{"commentv2":1,"number":31,"id":3021723,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I hate how this is just a world drop.\n\nI cant farm for it and i would really like it to make money","date":"2005-02-07T22:44:37-06:00","rating":-3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"UrbanP","importedSubject":"money"},{"commentv2":1,"number":32,"id":3021724,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"U better believe I'll get rich off this baby.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I stumbled accross this last night on the AH for 3.5g buyout. And I've sold 5 for 2.5g in about 2 hours of playing time since. This is a serious cash cow. Especially if people who want to use it change weapons. I'd like to thank whoever put it up for a decent buyout.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>all you poeple out there giving it away for 2.5g think about it this way: The best weapon enchant atm for a warrior (which is going to be your primary market as they have more use for then them any other class with the exception of rogues) would be crusader (worth about 150g if not more) or your +9 dmg (worth well over 100g). As i said, unless they want to use Deathgrip Guanetlets they are going to prefer this over anything else. Id sell this plan for upwards of 300g and would sell each chain for upwards 50g. At this point people will ask what the mats are for such an expensive enchant. so at this point u tell them its not the mats they are paying for but the rarity of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I seen that someone put the best enchant for a warrior would be crusader or the +9 damage, and put this steel weapon chain right up there with those, well a warrior can become immune to disarming effects if they go down the arms path, which is what I did, and just to let everyone know, it ticks off the horde if your alliance and vice versa, cause there are a lot of people that will try to disarm you right away.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You don't need this on your main-hand weapon if you dual-wield. Put it on your off-hand and something nice like Fiery on your main-hand. I only equip this against certain mobs and in PVP, but it's always there in my pack. I put it on an acceptable off-hander I got from a quest at about 40, still use the same one at 60 since it's only for certain uses. Even in PVP I don't always equip it since many rogues don't have riposte and only competent warriors remember to disarm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just wanted to post some info about this drop. I noticed that there are some effects and abilities by creatures in Warcraft that will disarm you without actually saying you are disarmed. One of these is an effect that the Bloodhound Mastiff from Blackrock Depths has. It's an effect called Expose Weakness and it acts like a typical disarm. I can confirm that by using a weapon chain, you are immune to the effect. The combat log will not show it as being immune. It will show that you resisted the effect. Just wanted to clarify this. <br /><br />Yes, the weapon chain does act like a typical enchant so it will overwrite any current enchants you have. Alot of people don't like droping an enchant on their weapon. I personally will never fight without one anymore. You only need it on your main hand weapon. Currently I am using a weapon chain on my main hand weapon and a Demonslaying enchant on my offhand wep. Works great in that first part of Dire Maul. =)<br /><br />Looks like this is starting to show up more as I see them for sale in the AH on Stormrage. They actually don't sell well at all. Most times I can't even sell them for 2 gold. One time I just started to offer to install some for free just to empty my bank a bit. Even that didn't get rid of any of these. Oh well, that's what you get for playing on a PvE server. <br /><br />Many thanks to Darkflame for making this post possible...<br /><br />Shallow<br />60 Undead Rogue Stormrage<br />For the Horde!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got this on 4/12/05. Seems to be a hard sell as everyone I talked to just wants it for free it seems. Anyway...I don't think 3 gold is a bad price for this installed. &lt;shrug&gt;<br /><br />I need to go test it out, but I think Blizzard still has a way for you to get disarmed even if you do have this installed. I was fighting something in BRD the other night and I was disarmed. However, it did not show up in my combat log as disarmed...it showed up as &quot;You have been affected by exploit weakness&quot;...or something like that. After this happened I died and went farming in STV for the chain. I'd have to say I made a total effort of 3 months of farming on and off before I got this plan. It's stupid how rare it is. <br /><br />It would seem to defeat the purpose of going through all the trouble of getting this if in fact you can still be disarmed. Otherwise I guess it's just a PvP item or good for show and tell. I'll try to post some follow up info about this. Otherwise msg me or email me in game if you need one of these...<br /><br />Stormrage: For the Horde!<br />Shallow, Lvl 60 Rogue</div>
