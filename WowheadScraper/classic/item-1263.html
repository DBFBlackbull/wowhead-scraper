It is good for any Warrior period.  I guess everyone that plays the game missed these changes that were placed in game months ago.\r\n\r\nThis is from Blizzard on one of the patch notes.\r\n\r\nInstant Attacks\r\nThe mechanics of most instant melee attacks have been modified to improve item balance. Previously, instant melee attacks did damage based on the damage range of the weapon, plus a bonus for the player's attack power. This bonus was then multiplied by the speed of the weapon. As a result, slow weapons did more damage than was intended, and fast weapons were considered inferior by most players. We have changed the way the attack power bonus is calculated for instant attacks. This change does NOT affect attack power calculations for normal melee attacks. Instead of multiplying by the speed of the weapon, the attack power bonus is now multiplied by a fixed number pulled from the following table:\r\n\r\nTwo-handed weapons: 3.3 (this means the 2.1 speed of Brain Hacker is considered 3.3 and so is the damage range when using an instant attack)\r\nDaggers: 1.7\r\nAll other one-handed weapons: 2.4\r\nAs a direct result of this, many weapons have shifted position in their relative power. In particular, many Epic (purple) quality items are now more powerful than slower Superior (blue) weapons.\r\nThis change was not made to reduce the power of instant attacks, but to correct the relative imbalance of weapon itemization. At a given level requirement, epic quality weapons should always be more powerful than superior quality weapons.\r\nPlease also note that all normal weapon swings will be completely unaffected by this change. The following abilities are affected by the design change: Sinister Strike, Ambush, Backstab, Whirlwind, Mortal Strike, and Overpower.\r\n\r\nSo you tell me why this sucks?  3.3 speed on instant attacks is not too bad at all.  3.6 or 3.8 is better of course but it is not bad at all.  This weapon is also a great one for Shamans and Paladins since they use auto attack.  The proc is 25% of the swings so it definately makes up for the damage lost from stats on other weapons.","date":"2006-11-28T10:03:27-06:00","rating":34,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":4,"id":7758,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"4172","body":"This weapon *DOES* suck for an MS warrior, and almost all 2h using classes at that matter. Why? They need the slowest weapons they can find. Yes, weapon speed was normalized, but damage sure wasn't! It isn't really the speed that matters, it's the top-end damage. However, the top-end damage is always higher for slower weapons, making slower weapons more favorable. \n\nThis weapon is pretty much a pile of trash for anyone on alliance side, and still isn't all that hot for shamans. All leveling paladins should have Seal of Command. It by far does the most damage of any seal. SoC is procs per minute (PPM) so the speed doesn't make it proc more\/less. Thus, the slower the weapon, the more benefit you will reap from SoC, the damage seal of choice for paladins. For shamans, you tend to use Windfury in PvP mostly, (leveling too, i know, but even so, you use rockbiter sometimes) and in PvP you want a lot of burst damage. You get more burst with slower weapons, and this weapon is about as fast as a 2h can get. Windfury may proc less, but those few procs willl be 2-3x as strong with a slower weapon. \n\nFor warriors, this weapon sucks because of it's speed. 2h Warriors are MS warriors, and use MS (Mortal Strike) as a prominent source of damage, especially in PvP (because it's instant, great for burst dmg). Because MS is based off of your top end damage only, which this weapon has very little of, slower weapons will be leagues better. \n\nI hope this helped clear a little bit up =D","date":"2006-12-06T17:47:39-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":2634771,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"[url=http:\/\/www.2and2.net\/Uploads\/Images\/brainhacker.jpg]http:\/\/www.2and2.net\/Uploads\/Images\/brainhacker.jpg[\/url]","date":"2005-05-04T06:43:59-05:00","rating":9,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Ognuroc","importedSubject":"Pic"},{"commentv2":1,"number":6,"id":2634780,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"The mechanics of most instant melee attacks have been modified to improve item balance.

I adverage 1 proc every 40-60 secs just like when I had crusader. on another weapon. It does around 133 nature damage and lowers intellect by 25. It makes a difference in PVP. So seeing that a fight generally last less than a minute it will proc about once per fight.

But as a drop, gift or something under 500g it is pretty nice.\n\nAlso I would not use it in an instance because as a shaman I really need a shield and my epic 1h axe for better protection\/armor to make up for that flimsy chain mail we wear. (What I wouldn't give for plate.) The nature damage is useless against most elementals. So don't count on it when fighting elementals. However the -25 intellect still works for what it matters. And the physical damage is good too.\n\nAll in all it is a worthy weapon if you understand how it works. It is not a one hit one kill weapon. But it does what it does really well.

If you are hard and heavy grinding maybe it will proc every other fight depending on how fast you are killing. \n\nDamage:\n200-300 additional damage\nThe additional Damage it does, seem to be based on the level and resistance of the mob or player you are fighting so it can be lower than the stated 200-300 damage. See above for the results I got.\n\nThis damage is NOT nature damage cold damage or fire damage. I believe it is based on the same damage that generates the Rend affect. I have not proven this yet. I am basing this solely on the fact that it uses the rend icon when Brain Hacker is active on an opponent.\n(New Information) A player who has used the Brain Hacker longer than me told me it is a bleed affect. I think he is right.\n\nHow the heck do I know? \n\nI tested it on a couple of hundred elementals that are immune to nature damage. The rock elementals and dust stormers of Silithus are immune to nature damage. Earthshock, lightning bolt purge had no affect on them. The fire elementals of the Un Goro Crater are immune to fire and some Water elementals are immune to cold damage. They could not resist the Brain Hacker's dmg. This means that this damage cannot be nature damage. \n\nI had a +7 dmg enchant put on it and that raised the damage slightly. I will upgrade to +9 when I return because every advantage counts. \n\nWith rockbiter I get around 170-220 dmg per swing. Keep in mind I am swinging at 2.10 so that is actually a lot of damage.&nbsp; ((new Information)) I have now added the 1% attack speed to my gloves so I am swinging at 2.08. This also slightly increased the weapon damage.\n\nIn some cases windfury actually deals more damage than rockbiter. With windfury's 20% chance to proc the speed of this weapon helps a lot. \n\nThis is how I make it useful: \nI drop a Strength of Earth totem for additional DPS, Grace of Air totem to help my chance to hit, chance to crit, armor and chance to dodge, cast windfury or rockbiter, I had a 1% attack speed enchant put on my gloves. I also cast flameshock and drop a magma totem for additional DOT.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a Shaman without any other epic, this is pretty nice. I do not know if other classes will like it or not. I would think so.\n\nI would not pay 900g or 1000g for it because as a leather worker who grind and quest for gold I have some cash flow issues. \n\nAlso I would not use it in an instance as a shaman. I believe a shield good 1h weapon would serve you better due to the additional protection\/armor to make up for that flimsy chain mail we wear. (What I wouldn't give for plate.) However when a shaman is called on to do straight DPS or draw agro because the warrior is in trouble or dead or some mob is chasing the priest and you want to get their attention; this weapon is great.\n\nAll in all it is a worthy weapon if you understand how it works. It is not a one-hit one-kill weapon, (one hit wonder). But it does what it does really well. I use it as my main PVP and PVE grinding weapon. \n\nGood Hunting\n\nAlp","date":"2006-07-16T06:43:59-05:00","rating":33,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"someone has lied to you....agi doesnt increase hit, i know it -.-","creationdate":"2006-09-27T06:43:59-05:00","id":1155506,"rating":5,"commentid":2634851,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Lumbendil","importedSubject":"hit?"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Alptraumhuf","importedSubject":"The Brain Hacker user's manual :)"},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"id":2634874,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"To all those who say the speed of this beauty blows for instant attacks: (From WoW's official site)\n\nInstant Attacks \nThe mechanics of most instant melee attacks have been modified to improve item balance.

I am a lvl 55 paladin on the kel' thuzad server and this axe is insanely wicked. I can solo a lvl 53-55 mob with this axe and my paladin. the amount of damage done over a short amount of time is amazing.

Dont ask me where this thing dropped because i do not know, I got lucky and found it on the auction house for a 900 gold buyout and spent all of my epic mount money on it. This axe after using it with my palli is worth every cent of that 900 gold spent on it and then some. so please tell me how to post some screenshots on here so i can share the excitement with you all as well. :) happy hunting and I hope every one of you get to experience this beautiful axe durring your world of warcraft trials.

On one hand it has fast speed, this means that it'll interrupt casting time much more often then a slow weapon. On the other hand using a faster one hand in combination with a shield is a waste. The reason why:A shield has almost no use against a caster that relies mostly on spell damage, you're using a weapon that does less damage than a two-hander and not getting any use out of your shield.\n\nSo, the Brain Hacker solves the two. It frequently interrupts casting time -and- gives you the damage output without having to sacrifice power for speed with a one hander.\n\nThe intelligence debuff just helps my case that it's made to be anti-caster.","date":"2006-09-05T01:51:09-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Iktik","importedSubject":"Anti-Caster Weapon"},{"commentv2":1,"number":83,"id":3010427,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"how often does it proc?","date":"2006-09-07T17:45:29-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"morkovBG","importedSubject":"Proc?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":84,"id":3010428,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"where do i get this?","date":"2004-12-21T10:48:16-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"TheSiliconEffect","importedSubject":"where"},{"commentv2":1,"number":85,"id":3010429,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I found it at Stratholme, off a gargoyle or shadowcaster.","date":"2005-02-09T07:16:22-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"freshdoom","importedSubject":"I got it at..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":86,"id":3010430,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Got this weapon on a trash mob in one of the first areas of scholomance.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6495</b></h3>I'm not quite sure why everyone thinks this weapon sucks. It is good for any Warrior period. I guess everyone that plays the game missed these changes that were placed in game months ago.<br /><br />This is from Blizzard on one of the patch notes.<br /><br />Instant Attacks<br />The mechanics of most instant melee attacks have been modified to improve item balance. Previously, instant melee attacks did damage based on the damage range of the weapon, plus a bonus for the player's attack power. This bonus was then multiplied by the speed of the weapon. As a result, slow weapons did more damage than was intended, and fast weapons were considered inferior by most players. We have changed the way the attack power bonus is calculated for instant attacks. This change does NOT affect attack power calculations for normal melee attacks.

In particular, many Epic (purple) quality items are now more powerful than slower Superior (blue) weapons.<br />This change was not made to reduce the power of instant attacks, but to correct the relative imbalance of weapon itemization. At a given level requirement, epic quality weapons should always be more powerful than superior quality weapons.<br />Please also note that all normal weapon swings will be completely unaffected by this change. The following abilities are affected by the design change: Sinister Strike, Ambush, Backstab, Whirlwind, Mortal Strike, and Overpower.<br /><br />So you tell me why this sucks? 3.3 speed on instant attacks is not too bad at all. 3.6 or 3.8 is better of course but it is not bad at all. This weapon is also a great one for Shamans and Paladins since they use auto attack. The proc is 25% of the swings so it definately makes up for the damage lost from stats on other weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4172</b></h3>This weapon *DOES* suck for an MS warrior, and almost all 2h using classes at that matter. Why? They need the slowest weapons they can find. Yes, weapon speed was normalized, but damage sure wasn't! It isn't really the speed that matters, it's the top-end damage. However, the top-end damage is always higher for slower weapons, making slower weapons more favorable. <br /><br />This weapon is pretty much a pile of trash for anyone on alliance side, and still isn't all that hot for shamans. All leveling paladins should have Seal of Command. It by far does the most damage of any seal. SoC is procs per minute (PPM) so the speed doesn't make it proc more/less. Thus, the slower the weapon, the more benefit you will reap from SoC, the damage seal of choice for paladins. For shamans, you tend to use Windfury in PvP mostly, (leveling too, i know, but even so, you use rockbiter sometimes) and in PvP you want a lot of burst damage. You get more burst with slower weapons, and this weapon is about as fast as a 2h can get. Windfury may proc less, but those few procs willl be 2-3x as strong with a slower weapon. <br /><br />For warriors, this weapon sucks because of it's speed. 2h Warriors are MS warriors, and use MS (Mortal Strike) as a prominent source of damage, especially in PvP (because it's instant, great for burst dmg). Because MS is based off of your top end damage only, which this weapon has very little of, slower weapons will be leagues better. <br /><br />I hope this helped clear a little bit up =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have read all the stuff people said about it is a bad weapon and it is a good weapon. Well a friend GAVE me one. Amazing really.<br /><br />Ok This is what I know about it from using it a lot. It is a good weapon and should be an epic.<br /><br />Proc: It proc about as much as crusader. I adverage 1 proc every 40-60 secs just like when I had crusader. on another weapon. It does around 133 nature damage and lowers intellect by 25. It makes a difference in PVP. So seeing that a fight generally last less than a minute it will proc about once per fight. If you are hard and heavy grinding maybe it will proc every other fight depending on how fast you are killing.<br /><br />I have seen some enemy players trying to down a mana pot or try to run away when it proc so I am assuming they feel the -25 intellect drop. <br /><br />I had a +7 dmg enchant put on it and that raised the damage slightly. With rockbiter I get around 199-220 dmg per swing. Keep in mind I am swinging at 2.10 so that is actually a lot of damage.<br /><br />In some cases windfury actually deals more damage than rockbiter. With windfury's 20% chance to proc the speed of this weapon helps a lot.<br /><br />Ok this is how I make it useful:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; With a strenght of earth totem, windfury or rock biter it is a really good damage dealer. So for a Shaman without any other epic, this is pretty nice. I do know know if other classes will like it. I also drop magman totem and a grace of air to help my chance to hit, chance to crit, armor and chance to dodge. This will get me through most fights.<br /><br />I would not pay 900g or 1000g for it. But as a drop, gift or something under 500g it is pretty nice.<br /><br />Also I would not use it in an instance because as a shaman I really need a shield and my epic 1h axe for better protection/armor to make up for that flimsy chain mail we wear. (What I wouldn't give for plate.) The nature damage is useless against most elementals. So don't count on it when fighting elementals. However the -25 intellect still works for what it matters. And the physical damage is good too.<br /><br />All in all it is a worthy weapon if you understand how it works. It is not a one hit one kill weapon. But it does what it does really well. I use it as my main PVP and PVE grinding weapon. I use a shield and 1h axe in instances unless I am called on to do DPS which has actually happened a few times. <br /><br />That is just my 2 cents</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Earlier I posted that the Brain hacker does 133 avg nature damage when it proc. Actually this dammage is NOT nature damage. Also the amound depends on the level of the mob or player you are fighting.<br /><br />How the heck do I know?<br /><br />I tested it on a couple of hundred elementals who are immune to nature damage. The rock elementals and dust stormers of Silithus are immune to nature damage. Earthshock, lightning bolt purge has no affect on them. Also they can resist the Seeping Willow mace.<br /><br />However they cannot resist the Brain Hacker's dmg. This means that this damage cannot be nature damage. I do not belive it is fire or cold damage either as I have tested on mobs immune to cold and heat.<br /><br />At this time I do not know what kind of damage it is I will post when I can determing this information.<br /><br />On an up note. I had my gloves enchanted with the 1% haste to battle and it seems to make a noticable difference with this weapon. Just a fyi.<br /><br />Remember<br />If you cannot be careful be quick. If you cannot be good be good at being bad. Live life one adventure at a time.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Alp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Brain Hacker, version 1.1<br /><br />Disclaimer: The following information is from my personal experience and may very from player to player.<br /><br />Stats:<br />Level 55<br />56.7 (I think) DPS<br />Chance on hit: Lowers intellect by 25 and does 200-300 additional damage<br /><br />Enchant I have on weapon is +7 dmg<br /><br />My experience<br />Icon: Same as rend<br />Brain Hacker Affect seems to be a bleed effect.<br />49 out of 53 � can be resisted<br />43 Non-critical hits<br />min/max 111-250<br />avg damage 169<br /><br />6 Critical Hits<br />min/max 277-398<br />avg crit 338<br />Note: the above information is not the weapon damage but the brain hacker affect. <br /><br />Proc: <br />I average 1 proc every 40-60 seconds just like when I had crusader on another weapon.<br />I have seen some enemy players trying to down a mana pot or try to run away when it proc so I am assuming they feel the -25 intellect drop. It makes a difference in PVP. So seeing that a fight generally last less than a minute it will proc about once per fight if you are lucky. If you are hard and heavy grinding maybe it will proc every other fight depending on how fast you are killing. <br /><br />Damage:<br />200-300 additional damage<br />The additional Damage it does, seem to be based on the level and resistance of the mob or player you are fighting so it can be lower than the stated 200-300 damage. See above for the results I got.<br /><br />This damage is NOT nature damage cold damage or fire damage. I believe it is based on the same damage that generates the Rend affect. I have not proven this yet. I am basing this solely on the fact that it uses the rend icon when Brain Hacker is active on an opponent.<br />(New Information) A player who has used the Brain Hacker longer than me told me it is a bleed affect. I think he is right.<br /><br />How the heck do I know? <br /><br />I tested it on a couple of hundred elementals that are immune to nature damage. The rock elementals and dust stormers of Silithus are immune to nature damage. Earthshock, lightning bolt purge had no affect on them. The fire elementals of the Un Goro Crater are immune to fire and some Water elementals are immune to cold damage. They could not resist the Brain Hacker's dmg. This means that this damage cannot be nature damage. <br /><br />I had a +7 dmg enchant put on it and that raised the damage slightly. I will upgrade to +9 when I return because every advantage counts. <br /><br />With rockbiter I get around 170-220 dmg per swing. Keep in mind I am swinging at 2.10 so that is actually a lot of damage.&nbsp; ((new Information)) I have now added the 1% attack speed to my gloves so I am swinging at 2.08. This also slightly increased the weapon damage.<br /><br />In some cases windfury actually deals more damage than rockbiter. With windfury's 20% chance to proc the speed of this weapon helps a lot. <br /><br />This is how I make it useful: <br />I drop a Strength of Earth totem for additional DPS, Grace of Air totem to help my chance to hit, chance to crit, armor and chance to dodge, cast windfury or rockbiter, I had a 1% attack speed enchant put on my gloves. I also cast flameshock and drop a magma totem for additional DOT.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />For a Shaman without any other epic, this is pretty nice. I do not know if other classes will like it or not. I would think so.<br /><br />I would not pay 900g or 1000g for it because as a leather worker who grind and quest for gold I have some cash flow issues. <br /><br />Also I would not use it in an instance as a shaman. I believe a shield good 1h weapon would serve you better due to the additional protection/armor to make up for that flimsy chain mail we wear. (What I wouldn't give for plate.) However when a shaman is called on to do straight DPS or draw agro because the warrior is in trouble or dead or some mob is chasing the priest and you want to get their attention; this weapon is great.<br /><br />All in all it is a worthy weapon if you understand how it works.

This bonus was then multiplied by the speed of the weapon. As a result, slow weapons did more damage than was intended, and fast weapons were considered inferior by most players</b>. We have changed the way the attack power bonus is calculated for instant attacks. This change does NOT affect attack power calculations for normal melee attacks. Instead of multiplying by the speed of the weapon, <b>the attack power bonus is now multiplied by a fixed number pulled from the following table:<br /><br />Two-handed weapons: 3.3 </b>(this means the 2.1 speed of Brain Hacker is considered 3.3 and so is the damage range when using an instant attack)<br />Daggers: 1.7 <br />All other one-handed weapons: 2.4<br />As a direct result of this, many weapons have shifted position in their relative power. <b>In particular, many Epic (purple) quality items are now more powerful than slower Superior (blue) weapons.<br />This change was not made to reduce the power of instant attacks, but to correct the relative imbalance of weapon itemization. At a given level requirement, epic quality weapons should always be more powerful than superior quality weapons</b>.<br />Please also note that all normal weapon swings will be completely unaffected by this change. The following abilities are affected by the design change: Sinister Strike, Ambush, Backstab, Whirlwind, <b>Mortal Strike, and Overpower</b>.<br /><br />Guess you guys wish you hadn't sold this weapon now, eh?<br /><br />kthxbai</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Apparently, you've even failed to read the notes. The change was only to the attack power <b>bonus</b> calculations, not the weapon damage calculations.<br /><br />I give you some math for an Arms spec MS with an assumed 700 AP unbuffed:<br /><br />===============================================<br /><br /><u>&quot;Arcanite Reaper 53.8 DPS, 3.80 Speed&quot;</u><br /><br /><ul><li>Prior to 1.8: <br />204.44 weapon damage (53.8 x 3.80)<br />16.82 bonus from stats (62/14 x 3.80)<br />190 old ap bonus (700/14 x 3.80)<br />160 added MS damage<br /><b>570.64</b> Total Damage<br /><br /></li><li>Following 1.8: 204.44 weapon damage<br />204.44 weapon damage (53.8 x 3.80)<br />14.61 bonus from stats (62/14 x 3.30)<br />165 new ap bonus (700/14 x 3.30)<br />160 added MS damage<br /><b>544.05</b> Total Damage<br /></li></ul><br /><br /><u>&quot;Brain Hacker 56.7 DPS&nbsp; 2.10 speed&quot;</u><br /><br /><ul><li>Prior to 1.8: <br />119.07 weapon damage<br />105 old ap bonus (700/14 x 2.10)<br />160 added MS damage<br /><b>384.07</b> Total Damage<br /><br /></li><li>Following 1.8: <br />119.07 weapon damage<br />165 new ap bonus (700/14 x 3.30)<br />160 added MS damage<br /><b>444.07</b> Total Damage<br /></li></ul><br />===============================================<br /><br />There you have it.

Sure AR is better but for a Mortal Strike template but if u are a fury like me there isnt 2h better then this one!<br />I hope blizzard dont change this axe, im a fury DW warrior and when i want to use a 2h well this is it! I got it a few days a go in a Scholomace run, puted Crusder on it OMG Flurry, Death Wish and BloodThirst is just see them fall :D:D:D.

As for my oppinion not the best axe, but it is good enough. And it procs 1-2 times in a fight. Because of it fast speed my rage bar most of the time is full. The only thing i hate on this axe is that with fatal wound it lowers intelect. Thats the stupidiest thing one could think of.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just some information for Pally:<br /><br />- Fast weapons = low proc rate<br />- Slow weapons = good proc rate<br /><br />For example, a weapon like this one will proc &quot;Commander&quot; about 1-2 times a fight. A slower one (3.9 speed) will proc about 2-3 times a fight and will proc for 70% of the weapon's damage. So more weapon's damage and slower is the weapon, better it will be.<br /><br />This is the same with Righteousness, slower is the weapon, better the damage will be. (107 holy dmg per swing for 3.9 speed and 80 holy dmg for 2.3 speed)<br /><br />Now, if you want to gain mana or heal (seal of wisdom or seal of light) go for a very fast 1H weapon <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8190">Hanzo Sword</a> (1.50 speed) and a good shield</div>

I am a lvl 55 paladin on the kel' thuzad server and this axe is insanely wicked. I can solo a lvl 53-55 mob with this axe and my paladin. the amount of damage done over a short amount of time is amazing. I have not cheked my dps with this axe yet however i will use it tomorrow and take a screenshot of my current dps as well as a couple other nice screenshots to share with all of you. Dont ask me where this thing dropped because i do not know, I got lucky and found it on the auction house for a 900 gold buyout and spent all of my epic mount money on it. This axe after using it with my palli is worth every cent of that 900 gold spent on it and then some. so please tell me how to post some screenshots on here so i can share the excitement with you all as well. :) happy hunting and I hope every one of you get to experience this beautiful axe durring your world of warcraft trials. It is truly a unique peice of work. job well done on this one blizzard, looks and performance as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On my server these things do not go for much. You can find them for 40-50g, maybe even cheaper. I mean SURE it doesn't have that great of a top-end damage, but what does it have? Chance to hit for an extra 200-300 damage + dropping intellect by 25. It would be great as a quick switch between other weapons in PvP. You come across a caster then just equip this really fast and take them out. Then while fighting other guys switch to your IBS or w/e else you have.<br /><br />I never thought the median was 195g though :O So do you guys think it's worth it since I see them all the time for so cheap?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think what alot of people fail to realize in regards to this weapon speed is what it's purpose is (especially in concern to classes that can't duel wield), as a &quot;brain hacker&quot;.<br /><br />Simply put it's an anti-caster weapon. On one hand it has fast speed, this means that it'll interrupt casting time much more often then a slow weapon. On the other hand using a faster one hand in combination with a shield is a waste. The reason why:A shield has almost no use against a caster that relies mostly on spell damage, you're using a weapon that does less damage than a two-hander and not getting any use out of your shield.<br /><br />So, the Brain Hacker solves the two. It frequently interrupts casting time -and- gives you the damage output without having to sacrifice power for speed with a one hander.<br /><br />The intelligence debuff just helps my case that it's made to be anti-caster.</div>

Striking for 150-200 damage, it was awful.<br />Few days ago, I respecced to 17 arms, 34 fury and put fiery enchant on it.<br />I couldnt belevie my eyes with the amount of damage I was causing. <br />Flurry, Enrage, Bloodthirst, numbers were swarming the screen. Sweeping lvl 57-60 mobs in a matter of seconds.<br />I love my brainhacker!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this weapons not so great if your a human warrior. i rather go with swords instead and get the +5 sword spec rather then +5 crit with axe you. with sword proc even though you have a 6% for an extra attack <br />you can still get more then 2 attacks. when you land on that 6% the first time you will get a second chance to get another attack and so on. i once got +15 extra attacks from the proc bc i was really lucky it might be 1 in 10k but normaly you will get about 2 or 3 extra attacks. Sorry folks but I'm giving this weapon a 6.5 out of 10<br /><br />plust when using swords as a human you get the +5 sword skill which is really good it adds +5% to hit with swords and .5% crit with them<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 14 20:36:06 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm not trying to start the &quot;my class only&quot; war. I play a Ret specced pally, and my principle role in my guild is to stand shoulder to should with out MT and add DPS (buffs, seals, heals not withstanding). In the case (quite often) of linked mobs, I will solo one while the party destroys the first one and then shifts to mine. For me, this is the ultimate weapon. My pally has very high strength, and with Bonecrusher, he routinely crits 1200-1400. This is a definite aggro buster. Brain Hacker hits fast, for 200-400, with crits in the 600-800 range. While I increased my DPS contribution in raids, I went through Scholo and BRD with this axe and never once pulled aggro off the MT. It's the only 2h weapon I've used that swung fast enough to make Seals of Wisdom/Light worth using in combat. If you're a pally, and you serve as an an offtank and/or crowd control, this axe is worth whatever you have to pay for it. Thank you DR. Alexei Barov, Scholomance, for donating this excellent weapon. I also own Destiny (350g from the AH), and there is no comparison. With Crusader on this axe, it is not as flamboyant as Destiny, but much more effective.</div>

(considering they go for 800g minimum, not including crusader which seels for anything up to 400g)<br />dont know if i'll be using it yet, or just sell it on.<br />moral of the story, you can get lucky sometimes!<br />great weapon and it looks sweet too..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To all those who say the speed of this beauty blows for instant attacks: (From WoW's official site)<br /><br />Instant Attacks <br />The mechanics of most instant melee attacks have been modified to improve item balance. <b>Previously, instant melee attacks did damage based on the damage range of the weapon, plus a bonus for the player's attack power. This bonus was then multiplied by the speed of the weapon. As a result, slow weapons did more damage than was intended, and fast weapons were considered inferior by most players</b>. We have changed the way the attack power bonus is calculated for instant attacks. This change does NOT affect attack power calculations for normal melee attacks. Instead of multiplying by the speed of the weapon, <b>the attack power bonus is now multiplied by a fixed number pulled from the following table:<br /><br />Two-handed weapons: 3.3 </b>(this means the 2.1 speed of Brain Hacker is considered 3.3 and so is the damage range when using an instant attack)<br />Daggers: 1.7 <br />All other one-handed weapons: 2.4<br />As a direct result of this, many weapons have shifted position in their relative power. <b>In particular, many Epic (purple) quality items are now more powerful than slower Superior (blue) weapons.<br />This change was not made to reduce the power of instant attacks, but to correct the relative imbalance of weapon itemization. At a given level requirement, epic quality weapons should always be more powerful than superior quality weapons</b>.<br />Please also note that all normal weapon swings will be completely unaffected by this change. The following abilities are affected by the design change: Sinister Strike, Ambush, Backstab, Whirlwind, <b>Mortal Strike, and Overpower</b>.<br /><br />I bought this for a mere 250g...<br /><br />Guess you guys wish you hadn't sold this weapon now, eh?<br /><br />kthxbai<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 30th 2006 at 8:52pm EDT by AllGoodNamesAreTaken</i></div>
