If you can reliably get fish attractors and want to farm these without moving around this is the easiest method.","date":"2020-08-15T16:11:45-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Listen to this man, don't fish at the beach","creationdate":"2021-02-04T02:12:53-06:00","id":1448233,"rating":1,"commentid":3223428,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"Zokat","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"droprate is more like 1 in 20 in my experience","creationdate":"2025-03-17T19:08:38-05:00","id":1763341,"rating":1,"commentid":3223428,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"Parmbin","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":false,"ptr2":false,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"In 25 min I got 8.

If you are not that high level Tanaris is probably a more safe spot than Azshara where you might have to fight level 50 mobs for your fishing spot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6842</b></h3>The drop rate of these babies increases from 00.00 until 12.00 (12.00 am to 12.00 pm) by approximately 20%. So it is best to fish them late at night or early in the morning.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8378</b></h3>These are used for stonescale oil. The oil is used as a reagent for Flask of Petrification, Flask of the Titans, and Greater Stoneshield Potion but the flasks rquire at least 30 of the oils so might take a while for you to get roughly about 30 eel for each oil to make the flasks. The flasks are used as buffs for raid guilds during fights so these are on of the most important reagents in the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>28434</b></h3>Saw a Stonescale Eel School @ 23.61 in STV.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>15831</b></h3>I've had a lot of success farming stonescale eels in Stranglethorn Vale. STV is second to only Azshara in terms of the number of eel pools that spawn. Plus fishing in STV, levels 30-45 vs. Azshara, levels 48-55 makes it possible to fish these bad boys at a lower level. Just to be clear, stonescale eels spawn in pools just like oily blackmouths and firefin snapper. Once you find a stonescale pool the catch rate should be pretty damn good.<br /><br />So what I do is start north of the Vile Reef and work my way south all the way past Booty Bay and then around the bend and up the Crystal Shore.<br /><br />I think Shaman have a nice little advantage here. I cast water walking and instead of running the route on land, I run on the water right along the shore. Running on water offers a lot of advantages. No annoying mobs attacking you while you fish, very few ally attacks (for the Horde!), and you don't have to navigate terrain changes (i.e. running around hills and mountains to stay on the coastline).<br /><br />If you get attacked while you're water walking you'll lose the spell effect but I haven't run across any mobs in the water that pop up and get ya. Be interested to know how it works for everybody. If you're on Mug'thol send me a chat.<br /><br />Kazumdol<br />Level 50 Shaman<br />Mug'thol Server</div>

I caught a total of 5 in ten minutes.&nbsp; I catch them without lures now and a skill on 234.&nbsp; I think your fishing skill needs to be over 225.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yup, i found the same... was fishing them up a lot in steamwheedle until the sun came up... all of a sudden way less eels and i started getting lots of clams, too (not that i mind, the very first one had a golden pearl in it : P).&nbsp; fishing seems to be better at night, really... nightfins rock when cooked...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as far as i am aware your best chance of fishing stonescales is with 225 fishing skill and +75 baubles. giving a combined fishing skill of 300. this will be the same wherever you catch the eels.<br /><br />since the book to give you 225 fishing can only be used at level 20, this is effectively the lowest level you can fish the stonescale eels.<br /><br />best time to fish the eels is around midnight, when drop rate can be as high as 1 in 2.<br /><br />stonescales will sell for very good prices, but mostly at weekends.&nbsp; if you mix fishing stonescales and deviate fish (for savory deviate delight) you can get rich very quickly.&nbsp; I regularly shift 50-100 gold worth of fish a week.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A little tip for all you aspiring anglers out there looking to hit it rich with Stonescales, their drop rate GREATLY varies depending on when you fish.<br /><br />Rate greatly <b>increases</b> from 12AM to 12PM (approximately 15%-20% rate increase)<br /><br />Rate greatly <b>decreases</b> from 12PM on, until midnight. (depending on the zone, it will be no more than a 1% to 2% drop rate)<br /><br />In order, the best places to obtain Stonescales are:<br />1. Bay of Storms, Azshara<br />2. Steamwheedle Port, Tanaris<br />3. Revantusk Village, Hinterlands (Horde)<br />4. Feathermoon Outpost, Feralas (Alliance)<br /><br />(This data is backed by 1000's of fish catches recorded by the Fishing Buddy addon, and is more or less correct.)<br /><br />Oh, and a common misconception when it comes to fishing in general, Fishing Skill does <b>NOT</b> determine what fish you will catch, it ONLY determines the rate at which &quot;fish get away&quot;. If fish are getting away to often, the zone is too high a level for your current skill.<br /><br />Hope that helps. ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im Horde on Dunemaul and I have noticed that the stonescale market has gone to hell.&nbsp; I used to be able to sell these things for 95s each, a dozen at a time, and they would all sell out.&nbsp; Ever since patch 1.9 the market has gone to hell.&nbsp; I am thinking its because of everyone out fishing spotted yellowtail for the war effort, with the byproduct being more eels getting caught... hence a greater supply, more competition, and lower prices.&nbsp; Thoughts?&nbsp; It also seems that the drop rate has increased, even in the day time I am getting 11%+ drop rate at steamwheedle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I fish for these in the Bay of Storms.&nbsp; It has the best rate so far.&nbsp; A post above is helpful with the good times to fish but I find that from Midnight til 6:00 am is the best.<br /><br />I was fishing in BoS from 9am EST til 11am EST and caught 11 Stonescale Eel.&nbsp; Horrible rate at that time.&nbsp; However, I've fished there from midnight til 6am (various 2 hour periods within that time frame) and have caught 40 Eel in 2 hours.&nbsp; I help out our MT for raids so I fish to make him potions. <br /><br />Now, if you cannot stand fishing for so long or don't think you can stay awake, try this.&nbsp; Pop a movie into your DVD player (need a TV nearby), turn off game music, turn speakers up so you can hear the swoosh and just watch a movie.&nbsp; Whenever you hear the swoosh of catching the fish, just unhook it and cast again.&nbsp; Fishing buddy helps for the recast too if you use that.&nbsp; And make sure it's a good movie!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lots of the comments in this thread have referred to 'crap fish' such as oily blackmouths and firefin snappers.<br /><br />altough not as profitable as stonescale eels, the above fish are used in mid level alchemy and will also sell pretty well.&nbsp; <br /><br />both of these fish make reagents (blackmouth oil and fire oil) which also sell quite well, and are used to create potions.&nbsp; if you cant be bothered to sell these fish, give them to a mid range alchemist and they will be able to raise their trade skill with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />As an alchemist and a fisherwoman, i have earned several fortunes from stonies, oilys and fins.&nbsp; i have helped to pay for half the mounts in our guild with the proceeds of fishing, and fishing has made my guild rich.<br /><br />the good news for fishers is that winter squid have just been replaced by summer bass.&nbsp; this means that the hunters and rogues that have been fishing them for the nice agility buff will more than likely quit fishing till they come back in the autumn.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; so potentially there will be less competition for those of us who are SERIOUS fishers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, ever since the 1.10 patch, the drop rate for stonescale eel has drastically reduced.&nbsp; I have been fishing them for months in both Bay of Storms, Azshara, and Steemwheedle Port, Tanaris.&nbsp; Since patch 1.10, i have spent about 8 hours fishing.&nbsp; The drop rate for bay of storms dropped from about 20% to 2% at best, and the drop rate at steemwheedle has dropped from 9 or 10% to about 2 or 3%.&nbsp; This is rediculous.&nbsp; Blizzard obviously changed the drop rates on these eels because of the the new tier sets that are out and require stonescale oil.&nbsp; The drop rates have effectively been cut to 1/10th of what they were before.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes drop rate is way down, I am also an enchanter and can confirm that greater eternal essence has been reduced about the same.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With v1.11 Blizzard implemented the Stonescale Eel Fishing Swarms, what you can found all around the world. It's not to hard to found them, all you have to do is walk to the eastern coast of Tanaris and start riding north and south along the coast. <br /><br />You can found 4 type of fishing schools which are <b>RANDOMLY</b> generated: firefin schools, blackmouth oil schools, stonescale eel swarms and floating wreckedges.<br /><br />On my server i can make 100g in an hour fishing only from those schools easily. You can found many <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52461">Mithril Bound Trunks</a> (many bolts of cloth, leathers, lvl ~40 green items), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52460">Rumsey Rum Black Label</a> (very good for tanks), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=39379">Strangekelps</a> (free action potions for example).<br /><br />There is only one tiny problem with this Schools, they are randomly spawns all around the place. So if you looking only for Stonescale Eels, you have to fish out most of the schools to make them change. But it will worth it, believe me... prices already going down coz of this, but at least we don't have to spend hours in Bay of Storms at nights.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They go around 1 gold a piece on shadowsong/eu.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Never fish on daytime, but only between 0:00 and 12:00 because the droprates double in that time. <br /><br />Go fish on he Forgotten coast, its the best spot and it has a droprate of 20 eels per hour (during nighttime offc.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For anybody thats ever been fishing, night fishing hardcore fishing. You'll know that you fish different fish from different places at different times of the day! Seems that Blizz incorporated that train of thought in this game! which is pretty damn cool.<br /><br />Ie. Fishing from ponds, pools, lakes, streams ya gonna catch different fish at different times of the day and different weather conditions!<br /><br />Fish have eating habits the same as you and me different fish have different eating habits hence the stonescale eel come alive at night time... spot of night fishing anyone?<br /><br />little hint, keep an eye out in STV when it rains... it drives the Stonescales crazy they must think its feeding time, all that pattering of rain on the surface of the water waking them from there sleep on the bottom of the stream!<br /><br />keyword here = different!<br /><br />Differentiate from your normal fishing habits and narrow way of thinking and remember Blizz have gone out of their way to incorporate a high element of realism in this game. Don't whine cuz ya dangled ya rod twice in the canal in stormwind expecting to hike out 10 stonescale eels.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

I have my hunter parked at Steamwhetel and he fishes there Mon-Fri on my Lunch break at work.<br />I feed them to my Warrior/Achly<br /><br />Yes I have had the odd day where I get more. But still my average is under 5 an hour.<br /><br />I was searching like a mad man on these over many different forum boards and webpages. It seems that this fish bites alot more often during the night then durign the day. <br />I havent tested this but many other people have confirmed this.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Jan 13 12:33:32 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>From all the posts I read about the locations of the Stonescale Eels...... I would go to Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris ... Bay of Storms in Aszhara ... off the East coast of the Hinterlands.... any where you have a char level of 40+ (i might be wrong) maybe 45+ and you have a body of water :))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My favorite spot for Stonescale eel is &quot;Zalashji's Den&quot; on the east coast of Tanaris ... i can get 12 in ½ hour normally !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fishing report:Thursday <br /><br />Steamwheedle Port and Feathermoon 8:25-9:25 | Strong fishing pole with aquadynamic fish attractors then switched to bright baubles. Base fishing skill around 210. Mostly spotted yellowtail, some rockscale cod, then several mightfish, a few winter squid as well. Came away with 5 Stonescales. But, it was very streaky. I suddenly hit 2 eels in a row, then huge lull then a couple more. Moved to Feathermoon by this time I had skilled up so fished mostly without skill ups. Hit 3 right away! Then as quickly as they came they were gone.....called it a night at that point. <br /><br />Totals for approx 1.5 hours<br />Stonescale Eel: 8<br />Raw Glossy Mightfish: 19<br />Winter Squid: 11</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Has anyone found a good spot for fishing these babies? The list is long and kinda vague. I'm hoping someone has a favorite spot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Catching stonescale eels does seem to depend on time of day. In all the zones I've tried (Feralas near Feathermoon Stronghold, Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris, The Hinterlands) my general impression is that the drop rate goes up somewhat after about 10:00 p.m. ST (server time), and perhaps even greater around 12:00 a.m. ST. So be prepared to stay up late.<br /><br />If I recall correctly, I think I had to be around skill level 200 before I could fish these, and even then it required Shiny Baubles (+75 to fishing)...which are easy enough to purchase.<br /><br />If you're at skill level 300 and you fish Aszhara, you'll still need some kind of bait. I have a lvl 48 shaman and getting to the Aszhara coast is a bit scary, but it can be done; I just drop Earthbind totems and run like h***. ;-)<br /><br />If you're an alchemist and you can find them, stonescale eels can be a real moneymaker when used to make Elixir of Superior Defense.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These things don't appear to sell anymore on the AH on my server.. dunno why. I'm the only one selling and the price is reasonable 5g a stack?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fished from Hetaera's Clutch at nearly 20% rate with another 20% being Summer Bass and the rest being mostly Darkclaw Lobsters. Downside is you need fishing at like 350 to even cast there and at 425 (300 + 100 lure + 25 rod) I still get fish that get away, but the eels make it worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fished up 23 of these last night in just over an hour. Azshara tloc 51,42 (Shattered Strand, right next to a Wavethrasher corpse on the beach). Was around midnight ST. Fishing Skill was 300, Strong Fishing Pole with Bright Baubles.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Apr 5 18:34:23 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With v1.11 Blizzard implemented the Stonescale Eel Fishing Swarms, what you can found all around the world, mostly at Strangethorn Vale and Tanaris. It's not to hard to found them, all you have to do is walk to the eastern coast of Tanaris and start riding from north to south, along the coast. <br /><br />You can found 4 type of fishing schools which are <b>RANDOMLY</b> generated: firefin snapper schools, blackmouth oil schools, stonescale eel swarms and floating wreckedges.<br /><br />On my server i can make 100g easily in an hour, with fishing only from those schools. You can found many <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21228">Mithril Bound Trunks</a> (bolts of cloth, leathers, lvl ~40 green items), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21151">Rumsey Rum Black Label</a> (very good for tanks) and some <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3820">Strangekelps</a> (for free action potions for example) too.<br /><br />There is only one tiny problem with this, they are randomly spawns all around the place. So if you looking only for Stonescale Eels, you have to fish out most of the schools to make them change. But it will worth it...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Did blizzard change the drop rate on these? A stack sells for 6g on my server now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I always fish at Feathermoon by the docks. At 300 Fishing with a Big Iron Fishing pole I catch an average of 30 eels per hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Are these found in schools?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Spent 30min fishing here last night and caught mostly yellowfin. Also got some mightfish and 7 eels which i sold for 1g each. Rate seems to be about 10% north of the port.<br />200 fishing + big iron pole + shiny baubles = 295 skill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Tanaris at night is definitely the place and time to fish these. When I tried fishing there in the day, I got about 6 in an hour. At night I got 20 easily in an hour with a 300 skill, a +5 fishing pole, and nothing but night crawlers. I wouldn't even bother fishing them during the day cause it is totally random. Go at night when nobody else is there and it's easy sailing.<br /><br />Made 40g on my first batch, 30g on my second. Whoever says raising fishing is useless doesn't know what they're talking about.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fished from midnight to 6 am server time in ruined reachs, ashazra. Average yield was 20 an hour. From 6am to 10 am average yield was down to 10 an hour. No clams were caught until 6 am. <br /><br />Clearly the fishing table has stonescale eels in 2 entries. The first is time independent, which is why you can catch some at any time of day. The second is time dependent with clams replacing eels after 6am, resulting in the lower eel yield.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>atm, at least on Turalyon, but prolly everywhere, no fish can be caught in steamwheedle because of a bag. thought you should know.<br /><br />/bow<br />/salute</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>tried fishing at tanaris at night. i got 20 eels easy plus yellowtail, firefin, mightfish and others. i also got an iron lock box. you don't even need the fishing swarms for this, just any spot will do. <br /><br />my skill was 210 with +25 pole and +75 bauble. too bad a stack of eels only goes for 10 - 13g. oh well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fduba</b></h3>Best place for me is Tanaris @ AM hours. Almost every other school is Stonescale. In 2h, I can get up to 4 stacks of Stonescale, 2 of Firefin, 2 of Blackmouth and a whole lot of boxes w/ pots, bolts and greens. All that can be worth around 100g depending on your server economy, maybe even more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>yannis390</b></h3>The Bay of Storms in Azshara is undisputedly still the most reliable place to farm these with little effort. If you are Horde, grab yourself the +25 fishing rod from the quest in the Hinterlands and bring some Aquadynamic Fish Attractors. Make sure you are 300 fishing. To see if you're in the right spot try casting your rod, it should say fishing level not high enough. Slap on the attractors and start fishing. 1 in 5 times you'll get a stonescale eel. If you can reliably get fish attractors and want to farm these without moving around this is the easiest method.</div>
