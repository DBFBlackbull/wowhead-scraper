<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You are sorely mistaken that this &quot;is useless in high level instances&quot;<br /><br />I don't know a good Warrior/Warlock around that wouldn't kill to have these in ZG, MC, and BWL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can't find the vendor using the yellow squares on the map for reference.&nbsp; Most likly not correct location?&nbsp; where is this guy?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Rolling Combat Text tells me these work in combat, so i believe it also when i checked my combat log. So go check again and see oif they work in combat. When you stack these with shaman totems and paladins auras they become worth while. These pots wouldnt be in game if they where useless. I make aload of these and magebloods and use them at free will mp5 rox :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Seems to me like these would be great for any warlock. With lifetap this is pretty much +12 mana per 5 sec. From a potion. That stacks with everything else. Real cheap.<br /><br />Any reason for a warlock not to use them like mad in instances?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yes, they work in combat, and no, theyre not MT pots. Theyre for most anyone else. Or for MT builds when youre farming, and have no one else around, cause its free HP thats easy to get. And also yes, gromsblood and plaguebloom is easy to get. So in the end its simply a matter of WHY THE HELL NOT?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where did u buy it? Somebody a description? The places marked on the map arent enough for my success..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a rogue, I love this potion.&nbsp; I rarely draw aggro, and in most fights I'm trying to survive against AoEs/dots that bosses have. <br /><br />This potion, along with some of my other alchemy tricks, give me a good chance to survive an encounter when a healer can't get right to me (which is often).&nbsp; <br />I can regen enough health through this to survive an AoE with enough health to keep going...or if I'm unlucky and get hit with some damage while I have the &quot;recently bandaged&quot; debuff...this potion can provide me with enough Regen to keep my health at stable levels long enough to either have a healer get to me in time to keep me alive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Certainly, more of a pve potion, but it is an effective one none the less.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i cant fint the vendor that sells it :( can someone tell me that plz</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you actually leveled your alchemy as you leveled your character you would know the use for this potion.&nbsp; That weak trolls blood worked great running around Elwynn.<br /><br />Sure it's not going to save you in combat.&nbsp; That's not what it's designed for. It is a re-generation potion.&nbsp; It's use is to keep you (or your party) moving along without having to stop to eat, bandage, or heal.&nbsp; It's use is to &quot;top off your health&quot; after fighting one mob while you are moving on to the next. <br /><br />-Vorax</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Going for about 9-10g each or 45g a stack on my server.&nbsp; IMO these are so not worth the cost.&nbsp; I use Mighty trolls blood potion, 2.5g a stack.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Confirmed 5/11/06.<br /><br />I just tested it out.&nbsp; Let a naga in Azshara beat me on the back of my head for a couple of minutes, watching my health meter the entire time.&nbsp; Not once did my health go UP.<br /><br />They really need to change the tooltip, if this is working as intended.<br /><br />As of now, this potion is only good for grinding...&nbsp; to reduce downtime.&nbsp; No other purpose.&nbsp; And even then, when you're grinding you are usually pulling one mob after another except when your drinking/eating.&nbsp; So yeah, it's pretty much completely worthless unless it's just bugged and they plan to fix it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Troll's Blood potions do not work in combat.&nbsp; If you do not believe me here's a simple way to test it.&nbsp; Take a friend to a 45+ mob area, and take the potion.&nbsp; Aggro a mob and let it hit you a few times, then have your friend grab aggro.&nbsp; Your health bar will not go up.<br /><br />I recently bought a Lifestone, which also does not work in combat.&nbsp; I petitioned a GM about it, and this was the reply:&nbsp; I apologize for the inconvenience, but unfortunately, there is a known issues with items allowing for players to regenerate health during combat.&nbsp; We're currently working on a resolution to this issue.&nbsp; Potions, however,&nbsp; will never allow players to regenerate health during combat.&nbsp; I apologize for the confusion.&nbsp; Thank you for your understanding in this matter.<br /><br />When asked about the timeline for the item fix the reply was 'soon'.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soon?<br />Ah classic Blizzard, dont you love them.&nbsp; <br />If this potions was never designed to work in combat I see no point to it either.&nbsp; I was think of getting some to up my health regen but I guess that is just a dream.&nbsp; What a load of usless rubbish!</div>
