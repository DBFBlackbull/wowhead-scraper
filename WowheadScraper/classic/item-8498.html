I happened into the SOS to finish my artisan fishing quest, and noticed that there were green whelps.  I suddenly remembered reading on here that these are the Dreaming Whelps that drop the rarest of all - the tiny emerald whelpling!  So I decided to grind for a bit, they are still green for my lvl 43 NE Hunter.  I was not alone however, there was a Troll rogue farming there as well.  I think he had already been there a while when I got there as he seemed to have a system going.\n\nI farmed for a bit, and every time we went for the same one, he would get his hit in a millisecond before me and would get the loot.  I left, ate dinner, came back farmed a bit and then left again for some family time.  I decided to go on and try a bit more before bed, and I said to my Husband that \"I wish the game would pity me after all these months of grinding whelps, and give me at least 1 whelp drop - 2 if they are feeling generous, cause I want one as a pet as well\".  2 more kills later I still had nothing.  \n\nThe place was cleared out and we were all (a warlock had joined us by this time, and Mr. Troll rogue was STILL farming 4 hours later) waiting for them to rez.  I saw one come up at the same time as the troll who was closer.  I put up cheetah and ran straight for it.  This time it was my arrow that beat his dagger by a millisecond.  He watched to make sure it wasn't really his loot (the hits were that close) and when I right-clicked to loot, there it was!  Since I couldn't tell him that I got it, I started dancing and blew him a kiss, I guess it was mean, but I was so happy, and he was horde after all!  \n\nI am sure his guildies probably got an earful that night, cause there was no mistaking that I got the whelpling.\n\nIf you are reading this (Troll Rogue named Goir from Eitrigg), I want to say that I am sorry you spent so long farming to lose out like that, but I am not sorry I beat you to the punch on that one.

And posted it a few times for 299Gold-499Gold for 8 hours. I posted it for shorter times mainly because I wanted to be there when it sold to collect my $$$ asap! I was also hoping it would encourage someone to pay my insane ripoff price of 299Gold.\n\nFinally sold it on December 21 2006 for 175Gold min to 299Gold buyout.\n\nBasically, some players have too much money on their hands, and will pay 175Gold for a stupid pet dragon. Well I hope they enjoy it. Personally, I find the ingame pets destracting. Anyway. If you have this and are selling it, GO FOR THE RIPPOFF! and post it for a high price. Chances are, people will look at your high price, say your a gold farmer, and not buy it the first 5 or six times you post it. Then drop the price a few weeks later about 100Gold or so. People will think your desperate to sell the darn thing, (perhaps because its been on the AH for so long during peak hours and not selling) or perhaps they will think that their getting a deal.\n\nAnyway, like someone else said, you should get at least 100 Gold for this. Especially if you are on an older server. If you are on a newer server, try for at least 500 Gold (imho).

When I got there I began to sell me stuff and I noticed that there was a red thing in my pack so I moused over it and there was my first Tiny Emerald Whelpling pet.  Only took 2.5 hours and 50 kills :)  I have not sold it yet I can't decide what I want to do with it.  But for those less lucky than myself dont give up.

The ratio of Dreaming Whelps to Adolescent Whelps is approximately 1:1. [b]Only Dreaming Whelps can drop the Tiny Emerald Whelpling[\/b] (at approximately a 0.08% drop chance). You may encounter competition from players on the quest Dream Dust in the Swamp, which requires the Speck of Dream Dust dropped by both types of whelps. If they are feeling particularly nice, you could suggest that they kill the Adolescent Whelps while you kill the Dreaming Whelps. \n\nSome players are unaware that Adolescent Whelps do not drop the pet, and you can use this to your advantage during peak hours where there is likely to be more competition.\n\n[b]It takes the whelps 6.5 minutes to respawn after being killed.[\/b] Based on this, you can expect to kill 60 Dreaming Whelps per hour with no competition. So, you have a 50% chance of getting the pet after ~14 hours of farming, a 90% chance after ~48 hours of farming, and a 95% chance after ~62(!) hours of farming.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've had a dark whelpling for a while now and today (7 april 2006) I got my disgusting oozeling.<br /><br />Tips if you don't wanna be bored while grinding, is to have a good guild with a funny guild chat, makes time fly away, this is what made me forget how boring it was when I was hunting for my dark whelpling :). <br /><br />Another tip is to read a web comic from the beginning to the end while you'grinding. I read pvponline.com while hunting for my oozeling, but you can also check out machall, gucomics, penny-arcade and ctrl-alt-delete. This only works for meele classes like druid, shaman, hunter, warrior and rogue. Maybe warlock can do it to with a little wanding.<br /><br />Podcasts is also nice :) Listening to &quot;The Dawn and Drew show&quot; while grinding Timbermaw rep :)<br /><br />Just shift your attention to something else other than the thing you're killing and it feels that it goes much faster :).<br /><br />Vote for me, cause these tips must be spread to the people :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I was just in a mood to grind myself a Tiny Emerald Whelpling, went to swamp and started to shoot at those dragons with my magical spells. (yes I am a mage)<br /><br />Took me... lets say 100 to kill and about 30 a 45 min. time? Something like that.<br /><br />It was so frustrating to see other people grinding with you (while you were already there for some time). I lost so much Hope and faith by than that I even wanted to give up. Lucky me I did not, I was just running like a grazy cat from dragon to dragon, told a little Hunter to flee (and so she did :/) and left the items inside dragon's pocket so the warlock could not skinn the hide.. and later on went gone too.<br /><br />10 minutes later I saw this Item of this Dragon whelpling. I could not believe my own eyes.<br /><br />Before I was thinking like: &quot;Your always the one whoes never lucky, and when more people &quot;strangers&quot; join, you will see they will find this whelp right in front of your nose&quot;.<br /><br />Well, Don't give up, just keep faith and if you're not lucky today, you will be next time!<br /><br />Uprisings,<br />Earthen Ring/ Europe<br /><br />Ps: The post above mine sounds pretty good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A friend paid me 20G to farm for it for an hour. I didn't pick up one. I still got the 20G, but felt bad about it. I was determined to get one for my guildmate. I farmed for DAYS to get one. Didn't. Then a couple of weeks later I was looking for ore in Blasted Lands and kept dying, so I decided to go to Swamp of Sorrows to try again. The first Dreaming Whelpling I killed dropped a green item. I thought this was a sign that the odds of drops were greater. In 5 or 6 kills, I got one! Not only that, but I got a SECOND one 4 hours later, that same morning. Not only was I able to get one for my friend, but I get to keep one as well! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It is a hard one to find...some just get lucky. Some say that for every 1000 kills of a Dreaming Whelp, you get it...but the problem with that is this: Let's say you killed 999 of them...the next joe schmoe that kills one...gets it. Just a theory...but if that is the case...you get the idea of how rare it is. I myself spent a whole month trying to get one, and I finally did...Today! (/cheer)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hey! I am still farming for my little dragon! Just thought i would drop some notes in about the little guys for Horde members. (stuff I had problems with) How do you get to the Swamp? From Stranglethorn Vale, run north..go through Duskwood. Go around Darkshire unless the guards wont eat you for some reason. in the very northeast corner of Duskwood is a tower with Undead npcs in it. Take the rd east right next to that. It will take you through Deadwind pass (name?)..follow the rd north and then a little east. STAY on the rd. Very not pleasant vultures here. When you enter the Swamp, the whelps are on your immediate right next to a pond. You will miss them if you are not careful. Stonard, a Horde camp, is just down the rd a bit. Plenty of food, flight path..etc! Best of luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have a grand tale to tell for this one...<br /><br />I have been grinding whelps of different levels hoping for a drop since I was lvl 15 both with friends and without, died many times and got some nice greens from it, but no whelplings.<br /><br />I had given up and have been playing aimlessly since I got my mount at level 40. I happened into the SOS to finish my artisan fishing quest, and noticed that there were green whelps. I suddenly remembered reading on here that these are the Dreaming Whelps that drop the rarest of all - the tiny emerald whelpling! So I decided to grind for a bit, they are still green for my lvl 43 NE Hunter. I was not alone however, there was a Troll rogue farming there as well. I think he had already been there a while when I got there as he seemed to have a system going.<br /><br />I farmed for a bit, and every time we went for the same one, he would get his hit in a millisecond before me and would get the loot. I left, ate dinner, came back farmed a bit and then left again for some family time. I decided to go on and try a bit more before bed, and I said to my Husband that &quot;I wish the game would pity me after all these months of grinding whelps, and give me at least 1 whelp drop - 2 if they are feeling generous, cause I want one as a pet as well&quot;. 2 more kills later I still had nothing. <br /><br />The place was cleared out and we were all (a warlock had joined us by this time, and Mr. Troll rogue was STILL farming 4 hours later) waiting for them to rez. I saw one come up at the same time as the troll who was closer. I put up cheetah and ran straight for it. This time it was my arrow that beat his dagger by a millisecond. He watched to make sure it wasn't really his loot (the hits were that close) and when I right-clicked to loot, there it was! Since I couldn't tell him that I got it, I started dancing and blew him a kiss, I guess it was mean, but I was so happy, and he was horde after all! <br /><br />I am sure his guildies probably got an earful that night, cause there was no mistaking that I got the whelpling.<br /><br />If you are reading this (Troll Rogue named Goir from Eitrigg), I want to say that I am sorry you spent so long farming to lose out like that, but I am not sorry I beat you to the punch on that one. All's fair in love and war!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ive done the math on this for the whelping and what i got was that you have to kill nearly 2k dreaming whelps if u want it to drop which might explain why some of you killed so many of these d@mn things.<br /><br />ive been having problems with them myself i started farming 3/4 of the way to 43 and now im 1/4 of the way to 44 and all of them are green or gray to me. and out of all that i have farmed right now i have around 27 small flame sacks and on my server the can sell for a pretty penny<br /><br />hoping if i do get 1 that i can sell in the AH and get my mount training which i have been wanting for some time now</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This dropped for me on Midev on December 4th. When it dropped I emediatly came here to research what I had and was suprised at the insame prices ppl would pay for a pet. For those of you interested in its value, I hope the following notes help.<br />Dropped on Dec 4 2006 on Mediv.<br />IronForge AH posting price for &lt;=2 hours ~1.5 silver.<br />IronForge AH posting price for 8+ hours exactly 5 silver.<br />IronForge AH posting price for 24 hours ~25 silver (im not certin about this)<br /><br />With the AH cut, i netted 171Gold. Im quite happy with my sale :)<br /><br />Posted on Medive AH 5-7 times on various Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Monday nights from December 4th 2006 to December 21 2006.<br /><br />Those seem to be the busiest days, when most people play, so I had the best chance of selling it.<br /><br />Posted it 5 times for only 2 hours at a time at 299Gold min to 499Gold buyout. And posted it a few times for 299Gold-499Gold for 8 hours. I posted it for shorter times mainly because I wanted to be there when it sold to collect my $$$ asap! I was also hoping it would encourage someone to pay my insane ripoff price of 299Gold.<br /><br />Finally sold it on December 21 2006 for 175Gold min to 299Gold buyout.<br /><br />Basically, some players have too much money on their hands, and will pay 175Gold for a stupid pet dragon. Well I hope they enjoy it. Personally, I find the ingame pets destracting. Anyway. If you have this and are selling it, GO FOR THE RIPPOFF! and post it for a high price. Chances are, people will look at your high price, say your a gold farmer, and not buy it the first 5 or six times you post it. Then drop the price a few weeks later about 100Gold or so. People will think your desperate to sell the darn thing, (perhaps because its been on the AH for so long during peak hours and not selling) or perhaps they will think that their getting a deal.<br /><br />Anyway, like someone else said, you should get at least 100 Gold for this. Especially if you are on an older server. If you are on a newer server, try for at least 500 Gold (imho). There is no fixed worth for this item, so you will just have to post it a few times at various prices to gage where ppl are comfortable buying.</div>

I've made 2 levels (36-38) and still no tiny emerald whelpling. ... ...

Granted the drop rate is some independant variable, but since only one has been reported I need to ask... &quot;Has anyone gotten a &quot;tiny emerald whelpling&quot; and if &quot;yes&quot; then where from; what mobs dropped it?</div>

I don't have my total kill count for Dreaming whelps since I wiped out my data for the new release, but I'm sure it's well over 2000 kills. The kill count for the Dark was just under 700 kills. <br /><br />PS: I have a first mates hat looking to trade for a Hyacinth Maccaw on Silver Hand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The quest you are talking about is called &quot;Dream dust in the swamp&quot; or something like that. You get the quest in the inn in BB on the same floor as the horde flyers. It is part of a series so you have to complete a few quests before you get it. I am a horde player so i am not sure if it is available to alliance players. I did the quest in SoS and didn't get a thing. I have probably killed a couple hundred by now and still no luck. I will keep trying tho and maybe someday i will find one.</div>

I spent the next two and a half hours grindg away tring to get this thing. I had killed 49 of the Draming Whelps and about 50ish of the other ones. I was heading out of teh place and I saw a Dreaming Whelp pop up so I charged it just for the fun of it. I killed it in a mear 3 hits looted it and continued back to the village. When I got there I began to sell me stuff and I noticed that there was a red thing in my pack so I moused over it and there was my first Tiny Emerald Whelpling pet. Only took 2.5 hours and 50 kills :) I have not sold it yet I can't decide what I want to do with it. But for those less lucky than myself dont give up.

I've been frustratingly farming for mount money when I veered off course and killed some whelplings in SoS. This dropped off of like the third one.

You may encounter competition from players on the quest Dream Dust in the Swamp, which requires the Speck of Dream Dust dropped by both types of whelps. If they are feeling particularly nice, you could suggest that they kill the Adolescent Whelps while you kill the Dreaming Whelps. <br /><br />Some players are unaware that Adolescent Whelps do not drop the pet, and you can use this to your advantage during peak hours where there is likely to be more competition.<br /><br /><b>It takes the whelps 6.5 minutes to respawn after being killed.</b> Based on this, you can expect to kill 60 Dreaming Whelps per hour with no competition. So, you have a 50% chance of getting the pet after ~14 hours of farming, a 90% chance after ~48 hours of farming, and a 95% chance after ~62(!) hours of farming. This is probably the hardest of the three whelpling pets to obtain due to the limited (and shared) spawn points. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KalisiaDL</b></h3>1593 whelps killed/farmed, and it dropped for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TrAuZ</b></h3>No drop yet after a week of farming, 4-6 hours per day, but I'm not giving up!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2ifbysea</b></h3>I arrived playing a horde hunter at level 33. I stayed until it dropped at level 39. I want to play a different game now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dayoodin</b></h3>Finally got this today! For me, the drop rate was extremely and painfully low--I killed approximately 1,000 of the whelplings to get this. Phew. Edit: And, actually, now reading the other comments, I think 1,000 is exactly correctly when it came to my drop rate, as it appears that there is some evidence that a certain percentage of people get it at exactly their 1,000th kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lorra702</b></h3>So my understanding was that the whelp pet would only drop from the Dreaming Whelpings but i decided to also kill the Adolescent Whelps just for extra gold &amp; drops. To my surprise, the pet dropped today from an Adolescent after about 2 hours of farming. So be sure to kill both types!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>awhelchel</b></h3>I can 100% confirm that an Adolescent Whelp in the same area as the Dreaming Whelp in Swamp of Sorrows just dropped this for me. I have tried FOREVER to get this and bypassed killing the Adolescent Whelps many times because it says only the Dreaming Whelps drop it. Well that is not true.</div>
