<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Revered is definately worth trying to get, depending on your profession, but Exalted? Is that trinket really that good?<br /><br />All my sources say no, even if the faction quests are a bit easier now. (depending on how you look at it)<br /><br />So my advice is to find out what it is you are after, and set that goal. <br /><br />I will say that yesterday, I was barely unfriendly with Timbermaw Hold - I ended my faction grind in a 20 person raid 8 hours later 25% into Honored.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So exactly what mobs drop these?<br />I have killed winterfall furblogs now for 500 rep and i've yet to see one, i've gotten that Ritual thingy but no beads.<br /><br />Never mind, just finished the prequest (didnt know there was one) and got beads from my first kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im sure theres something you must need to do first...<br /><br />Try talking to the furbolg on the felwood side and do his quest once<br /><br />And those drop rates from thott are way off cause its reporting how many of them were killed from b4 patch, I know no one killed over a million furbolgs yesterday</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My rep is also droping, or bad rep is rasing. I tried all three camps. I think it started when I took the quest to kill 8 of each kind.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>after patch I no longer get this quest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i am having same problem&nbsp; since the patch i won't get them but if a group member loots after me they get them off my loot</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you have hostile reputation at any faction, the colour bar and the numbers are supposed to decrease like this instead of increasing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Make sure you have finished the quests first and have sufficient rep, then you will notice the drop rate much higher. I net about 1 per 3 kills and often get 3-4 in a row.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been farming these guys for a while now and have found it to be quite lucrative as well as getting your reputation up.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Your reputation should go up by 5-6 per kill of the Winterfall Furlborgs.&nbsp; You also get 55 rep points per 5 beads you turn into Saifa who sits at the Timbermaw tunnel on the Winterspring side.&nbsp; I average about one bead per 2-3 kills.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; There is a lot of good loot to get from these mobs.&nbsp; I have received countless green drops and quite a few blues (ie Twig of the World Tree and several Beast and Portal cards), not to mention all the silver and runecloth.&nbsp; I have earned well over 200 gold with silver and selling drops.&nbsp; I also have started a new character just to store all the runecloth.&nbsp; I think I ave about 35 stacks in the bank.&nbsp; Also there is a lot of Icecap and Mountain Silersage around the camps with the occasional Black Lotus (5 thus far).<br /><br />3. Currently my rep is at 80 percent Honored, but I have about 1000 beads waitint in the bank to use when I'm halfway thru Revered when you don't get rep for kills any longer.<br /><br />So if u have the time and patience, it is very worthwhile to farm these guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sorry, but I meant that once you get to revered, there is no more rep per kill...only when beads/headdresses are turned in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finally got my exalted reputation.&nbsp; If you do nothing but kill Furlborgs until you get to revered, it takes exactly 1910 Winterspring Spirit Beads (assuming you are starting at 1 point revered) to get to exalted.&nbsp; So, basically, you have to kill about 6000 furlborgs averaging one bead per 3 kills to get to exalted.&nbsp; It was fun, lucrative and tiresome all at the same time.&nbsp; Good luck with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just so you know, the second Wintersaber rep quest is Winterfall Intrusion.&nbsp; This requires you to kill 5 Winterfall Shamans and then 5 Winterfall Ursas, run back to Frostsaber Rock, turn it in, then repeat doing so.&nbsp; If you plan on getting Timbermaw rep, might as well do this also.&nbsp; Then you have a shot at getting the Winterspring Frostsaber, which is an armorless, 100% increase epic Saber mount, with purple stripes.&nbsp; It's beautiful and well worth it.&nbsp; It's sort of an extra prize at the end of your hard work ^_^.&nbsp; I'm honored with Timbermaw and Revered with the Wintersaber Trainers! <br /><br />Wingedhamham<br />Gorgonnash</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>k i have spent 2 lvls now grinding on timbermaws, but i cant get the bead quest for some reason. anyone one know the steps to getting it i must be missing something. i would prefer to start grinding in winterspring to up my L/W while i grind. i already did a quest that sent me to the quest giver, but im not getting a bead quest. yea im high enough lvl 56. any help greatly appreciated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Turn in 5 for 50 rep toward Timbermaw Hold</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What mobs drop these beads? None are listed yet &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jan 4 17:25:23 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Btw u cant turn these in on Neutral rep yet :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Making exalted with Timbermaw takes 21,000 rep. at 50 points per 5 beads, that's 2,100 beads. At 4.70 drop rate, that's 44,680 kills. At 90 seconds per kill, that's 67,021 minutes of playtime, or 1,117 hours, or 46.5 play DAYS. <br /><br />Makes solitaire look exciting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where do yoou hand these in?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>nevermind...too much math...but if someone can tell me an estimate of how many kills from 0 unfriendly to exalted(including turn ins) thatd be great<br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 21st 2006 5:02am by Zephyrio</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>a correction to posts below:<br /><br />1. you CAN turn this in when you have neutral rep - that is how I got to friendly.<br /><br />and I stand corrected, it will take fewer kills if you save up the beads. ;-)<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jun 8 02:18:22 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>edit: I earlier seemed to be getting a far lower drop rate, but I'm now getting more frequent drops.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 19th 2006 at 5:23am EDT by zootle</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It is best to get a full group and go for farm furbolgs.
