<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thats because those ranks are simply expanding on the different ranks of gift and prayer.<br /><br />Gift of the wild rank 1 is a group friendly version of mark of the wild at lvl 50, and rank 2 is the one you get at lvl 60. Mark of the wild benefits from talents.<br /><br />Prayer is the same. the first one is 43 stamina (changed with talents) which a priest gets at lvl 48, and rank 2 is the 54 stamina (also affected by talents) that a priest gets at lvl 60.<br /><br />Since there is no greater rank than Arcane Intellect which we get at lvl 56, I'm not sure how a rank 2 is going to work. Unless blizzard decide to add another spell at lvl 60 which would be sweet =D. Also our AI should benefit from talents too!</div>

But you need the Arcane powder to use this buff and the powder is at Reagent vendor for 9S.<br />Now I had someone buff my lvl 53 priest with a version of this that cast 43 intellent on me. So I pretty sure there must be a higher rank than one out there, but dont know where to find it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dropped in scholo, a friend of mine won. Asked if I could have it for my alt and I got it for free. The next time it dropped, another friend dropped it, he gave it to me too, coz I had a friend that's mage... I would say rogues, warriors could sell it, but seems pretty stupid if a mana user sells it...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>glad to see they made this a blue rare item that has to be rolled for in the latest patch...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Shhh. I bought it off the AH yesterday for 3g 50s.&nbsp; The other one on there was for 10g.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A friend bought it for me on Emerald Dream EU (Alliance-side) for 5G on the AH. Wasn't expecting it but it was a LOVELY thing to see when I opened my mail just before heading into RFD with him. I'm now on the lookout for either a nice weapon or a bigger bag to pay him back. Shame I'm only lvl 39 but that's why we grind, I guess :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After reading posts on this item a couple weeks ago, searched for it on lothar, checked everyday, not one was being sold. <br /><br />there was 10 different people selling rank two tome though - 120g! minimum, others were selling it for more.<br /><br />Then today, i finally see it. rank 1. willing to pay up to 30g for it, bought it for 4g buyout. very happy level 58 mage. extra 30 min w/o having to buff! small thing but very cool imo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been searching for this item for two weeks now. I haven't seen it once on AH, and I have searched AH alot.<br /><br />Is there anyone who can tell the easiest way to get it? Im not so interested to go for a raid in Onyxia. Is there a better way? A way I can get it on my own?<br /><br />I want it so badly! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since BC came out once people hit 58, they are going out to the BC, and skipping all the higher end instaces. I have been looking for this book for almost a month, not one book. TONS of rank2, nothing for rank 1. Is it possible to buy a rank 2 and use it @ 70 and skip out of rank 1? if not.... get a group and farm it, make TONS of cash quick with that.<br /><br />Yoruichisan ~Black Dragonflight~</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In my mind this Tome should be given to mages in the guild for free! Sure it would give us 30 extra min without buffing, but the main purpose of this is for raids and instances when we can buff the whole group for 1 hour.<br /><br />so the main benefit is for the guild members that bring the mage to a instance for example! dont have to wait for everyone to be buffed and buff lasts an hour etc...<br /><br />Otherwise we mages should start charging for buffing people if we are made to pay to get these things:)!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Based on the price some guys are paying for this highly useful tome, the drop rate listed here must be incorrect or they're just really lucky and benefitting from sellers who are not very knowledgeable (and don't have any mage buddies to donate it to). I got mine last night in Scholo off an Adept and I was quite chuffed to get it since I've been looking for it for months now and never saw a drop. If I'd seen it on AH I wouldn't have hesitated to pay 20-30g for it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, whatever they did, the price is very low now.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So overall, what's a fair price for this from the AH? Cheapest I've seen yet is 30g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>is that indicating theres a level 2?</div>
