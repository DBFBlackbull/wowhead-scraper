It has an approximately 20-40% drop rate (depending on Blizzard's mood that month), and can be looted even if you do not have the quest. If you are in a guild that is able to successfully down Onyxia, but you have not yet reached Majordomo, make sure that you are still handing these out to your hunters. This is a useless item for any other class.<br /><br />-Aeryn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7121</b></h3>This is for the Rok'delar/Lok'delar (epic hunter) quest, the other half is from Majordomo's chest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's dropped for us every time we've gone - 4 times so far.&nbsp; None of our hunters have the quest yet, since we've been getting the priest epic quest item each time we downed domo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Same for my guild, the last 3 onyxia kills (just started doing onyxia) have dropped sinew.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Another way I look at this is:<br /><br />start crying when every class tier 2 helm has dropped...<br /><br />if not, then you haven't killed Ony enough times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The drop rate on the sinew will be improved next patch so no more ridiculous waits for sinews. Of course we get a ranged DPS nerf linked with this so enjoy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>we had it droped all kills (7x now) but all our hunters got it now so does anybody know if they can be dissed?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Those who have been through the hunter epic quest know all many of the nearly countless things wrong with it.<br /><br />The last part of the quest requiring a low drop from Onyxia I would have to say tops the list. I have had this quest done for six weeks. I am the only hunter in my guild who needs this. I go every time. I still have no sinew.<br /><br />After killing all the demons myself in mostly blues, having this random drop nonsense is unfair. I would rather have an extra difficult quest after the demons.<br /><br />Like I said, the hunter epic quest is aweful in its design.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>since beating the demons in mostly blues myself, ive gotten full GS, dragonbreath hand cannon (from bwl), 1 DS (head), both Jin rings from ZG, eye of hakkar, etc etc. i'm basically fully epiced. hunters should not have to wait this long for thier epic quest. if anything, make it 1 per ony, 100% if a hunter has the quest. that way its not &quot;easy&quot; but also not have to wait 3 months for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been to only 3 Ony raids but at least 2 of them this item dropped.&nbsp; I got it because no other hunter needed it even though i dont have the leaf.&nbsp; We've killed her about 15 or so times and all our top hunters all have the quest and are in the process of killing the demons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I would guess the Black Dragon Sinew has close to a 100% Drop Rate now.&nbsp; My guild runs Ony weekly and in the last 2 months it has dropped every kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got mine on my first onyxia run, no other hunter needed it, got lucky i guess.&nbsp; Just need my leaf to drop now, did MC for the first time on the same day, but no leaf, maybe next time :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>rofl, i would like to point out direfel absolutley pwned fortehhordes face IMO</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got to say if u dont have this leaf and your guild doesnt exactly go all the way to domo i suggest buying it from a guild and summon u there its eazyer no point in geting this sinew when u dont even ahev the leaf to start the quest i have the leaf but going to buy the sinew for another 100g GG :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>0/8 for me..<br />Bliztards, sort this sinew ^&amp;*! out. If you are on the quest make it a 100% drop, just like any other quest ffs! I mean, we have to get leaf, 50% drop rate fine, then solo 4 feckin demons, sure np, its an Epic quest at the end of the day, BUT then to have to wait for some crummy sinew to drop its a feckin joke! Tbh this crap is making me close to quiting! BAH!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just PUGed Onyt yesterday and won it! I don't have the leaf yet, but im getting it defaulted to me b/c of my sweet hook ups</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is the drop % that low?<br /><br />Pretty $%^&amp;ed up man !:P<br />hehe<br /><br />Hehe i dont have that problem i just go get rank 14 :P <br /><br />Cya Massacer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blizz make this $%^&amp; a 100% drop chance ive killed ony about 15 times and this crap hasnt dropped once! and every single message says the same damn thing so obviously something has to be done about the drop rate! its !@#$ing ridiculous!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sometimes its like a 1% chance there are chickens in the lair.. the run around and then they die sadly.. a painful,sad death by Onyxia's deep breath.. so sad.. making me cry</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>gg blizz, thanks for making the one thing beyond a hunters control not drop 100% of the time. my guilds done onyxia 8 times now with no sinew yet, and ive also seen helmet of 10 storms drop 2 times. ive had this stupid quest done now for around 2 months, while ive been trying to get into every ony run humanly possible since attuned, ive run ony about 15 times total and its dropped 1 time, and it went to a hunter that got the GM bow 4 days later due to the whole new honor system. by the time i finally get it i figure TBC will be out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as the guy who posted above said start crying when every other t2 helm has dropped, i can say that its happened for me, every single t2 helm has dropped once, including the shammy and dragonstalker, and ive yet to get my sinew. i hate blizzard</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yeah, i would grind the 22k honor needed for the GM crossbow, except it would be a waste of my time, since its not that much if any better than rhok, and considering ive done the entire quest for rhok it would make it easier to get the sinew...... except ive been waiting around 2 months so i guess not. and to the lock who says hes got it in his bag, good for you, its not like your cool or anything considering the fact that for some guilds its a 100% drop rate and others its not, just because you have it and other hunters dont doesnt make you special at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just lost this 'cause of a stupid moron ninja looting raid leader. I was the olny hunter and he ninjas everything. Why do people do that? Makes me so sad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes, it's for one of the epic hunter quests they just put in. I began creating a thread on enterelams hunter forums about the quests: <a href="http://www.enterealms.com/forums/showthread.php?t=963" rel="nofollow">http://www.enterealms.com/forums/showthread.php?t=963</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well its gonna be 9 weeks soon...honestly if the eye of shadow can be bought why cant they just make the sinew BOE...ive picked up 2 blue sinews so far (like i need anymore) i dont see why they cant just increase the drop rate...hmm maybe i can contact blizzard and trade the blue sinew for the black...=P(highly doubt it but would be cool)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate has definitivly been increased, we've had it drop 4 times out of 6 kills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone know if the drop rate on this has been increased?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped off a Cobolt dragon elite in Winterspring today.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped last night for my guild (first time we ever killed Onyxia! wooot!)<br />I nor any of the other hunters in my guild have the quest from the Ancient Petrified Leaf. The most we have is 1 Mature Blue Dragon Sinew, which belongs to me ^_^<br />So, in response, you *do not* have to have the quest for this to drop or anything else. It's just a random drop like the Blue Sinew.<br />Now I just need my leaf and my heads! =D =D<br />Good hunting out there!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is this 100% drop now? I've picked up 2 myself since 1.9 (I'm a warrior). We've never had it not drop since halfway through 1.8</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The mature blue dragon sinew drops off azuregos and is for forming the quiver part of the quest. The mature black dragon sinew forms the string for the bow. 21% seems a bit high for this drop though. My guild has never seen it drop once and other guilds report few drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there are two things for the Hunter-Q<br />Mature Black Dragon Sinew<br />Mature Blue Dragon Sinew<br /><br />So the only question left for me is: <br />Does it only drop when someone needs it for the quest or does it always drop, but only with 20%?<br /><br />If it just drop once if a hunter needs it, the 20% seem to high...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>GG killed Onyxia again tonight and no sinew, nor for a m8 in another guild. We both got all demons down. Plese make this 100% =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my guild one hasn't dropped in the last 16 Onyxia kills. Which is bad, because the sinew queue is currently 5 hunters long.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate for this is definatley not 100%.<br /><br />I can't seem to get it to drop off Ony for my hunter.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Drop Rate is definetly not a 100%. My guild's record, untill about 2 months ago (thats when we stoped running it for dkp), is 15 out of 74, which is roughly 20% drop rate. If it has been buffed since then it should be around 25%-30% now. I highly doubt that the drop rate has any relevancy to whether or not there is a hunter with the quest in raid, because out of our 15 drops, 8 were a waste.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>anyone know if the rate has been upped?<br /><br />Thott shows this at about 23-25%<br /><br />I had put a post on the hunter forums regarding it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm getting so tired of it not dropping, next kill will be my 6th after I've completed the quest where it hasn't dropped, and 9th or so since the last dropped.<br /><br />Since I kinda specced with the staff in mind, this is just freaking annoying. I wish blizzard would just make it a 100% drop when someone has the quest, just like essence of the firelord. *sigh*.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>killed Onyxia 8 times after I completed the quest and not a single sinew dropped. I'm starting to think that I'll get Ashjre'thul first -_-</div>
