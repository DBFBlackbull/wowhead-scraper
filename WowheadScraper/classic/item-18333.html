This can be done without aggroing any mobs.\n\n[b]Zul'Gurub Librams[\/b]\n\nOn its own, the Arcanum of Focus is an undesirable enchant. However, the Arcanum is used in conjunction with other materials for access to very powerful class-specific enchants available in Zul'Gurub for head and neck pieces. The NPC that provides these enchants is Zanza the Restless, and is located inside Zul'Gurub atop a pyramid by Mar'li and Bloodlord.\nBelow is a list of Arcanum of Focus enchants and the classes that require them:\n\nMage - Arcanum of Focus, Primal Hakkari Girdle, Mage Voodoo Doll: [u]Presence of Sight[\/u] 18 Dmg\/Heal, 1% chance to hit with spells\n\nPriest - Arcanum of Focus, Primal Hakkari Tabard, Priest Voodoo Doll: [u]Prophetic Aura[\/u] 10 Sta, 4 Mana Regen, 24 Healing\n\nShaman - Arcanum of Focus, Primal Hakkari Sash, Shaman Voodoo Doll: [u]Vodouisant's Vigilant Embrace[\/u] 15 Int, 13 Dmg\/Heal\n\nOther classes require different librams, dolls, and Primal Hakkari items for their equally excellent enchants.

Point of this is to get you to turn around once you get to the top and head in that direction. Once you get there, You'll see a pylon, with ur common elementals (Warlocks can farm these). In between the Pylon and the ramp, you can walk between without aggro and jump on the ledge...again, a glitch of some sort, without aggro on the skeletons...Once you jump the ledge, you can drop down, and see the ghost NPC (Gives great quest for possibly the best hunter helm next to MC\/BWL epics of course) The last 2 pats are there..common to each side of the NPC.\n\nso there...take bout 30 mins out, farm 10 of em, get ur libram.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>Arcanum of Focus</b><br /><br />The Arcanum of Focus, by itself, enchant a leg or helm piece with +8 healing/damage. It is made by acquiring the following ingredients:<br />- A Libram of Focus (drops in Dire Maul West)<br />- A Pristine Black Diamond<br />- 2 Skins of Shadow (found in Scholomance, one per instance)<br />- 4 Large Brilliant Shards<br /><br />Take the following ingredients to Lorekeeper Lydros. He resides in the Dire Maul library, which can only be accessed if one has the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/Crescent">Crescent Key</a>. The easiest way to get to him is by entering Dire Maul North. This can be done without aggroing any mobs.<br /><br /><b>Zul'Gurub Librams</b><br /><br />On its own, the Arcanum of Focus is an undesirable enchant. However, the Arcanum is used in conjunction with other materials for access to very powerful class-specific enchants available in Zul'Gurub for head and neck pieces. The NPC that provides these enchants is Zanza the Restless, and is located inside Zul'Gurub atop a pyramid by Mar'li and Bloodlord.<br />Below is a list of Arcanum of Focus enchants and the classes that require them:<br /><br />Mage - Arcanum of Focus, Primal Hakkari Girdle, Mage Voodoo Doll: <u>Presence of Sight</u> 18 Dmg/Heal, 1% chance to hit with spells<br /><br />Priest - Arcanum of Focus, Primal Hakkari Tabard, Priest Voodoo Doll: <u>Prophetic Aura</u> 10 Sta, 4 Mana Regen, 24 Healing<br /><br />Shaman - Arcanum of Focus, Primal Hakkari Sash, Shaman Voodoo Doll: <u>Vodouisant's Vigilant Embrace</u> 15 Int, 13 Dmg/Heal<br /><br />Other classes require different librams, dolls, and Primal Hakkari items for their equally excellent enchants.

A lock and mage (epic geared) can take all the first mobs in dm west + some invisible undead patrols pretty fast. A run takes about 30 min, and on average you need about 4 runs to find a libram. So to all the people that want to get their hands on one of these: Happy farming ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well, I've been hunter farming DM West for like 3 days now. No drop, although...I'm finding more ghosts to farm. They are probably the easiest, and most common drop of the book. For those wanting to farm it, (hunters)...Some locations...<br /><br />Door next to the Warpwind Boss, 3 pats (Stealthed, i suggest staying back with a constant flare) and there 2 constant guys...they hit hard...still do-able.<br /><br />Upstairs of the Warpwind Boss...on the 2 openings that circle around, 2 pats there...again, stay back with a flare<br /><br />In the right opening in the room, there's a upward ramp, take it, it's possible to doged the mobs of ghosts. Once at the top (sometimes a rare), There are 3 more pats (That i know of), You might have to walk around, it's possible to dodge aggro. Don't know their pat routes, but lettin em hit you isn't bad..o..btw...Leave pet on ramp, kill the ghosts there.<br /><br />Lastly, once you get to the top, if you turn around, there's a glitch to get on the ledge and walk on the ramp...hard to explain, i know. saves time to walk around and get aggro. Point of this is to get you to turn around once you get to the top and head in that direction. Once you get there, You'll see a pylon, with ur common elementals (Warlocks can farm these). In between the Pylon and the ramp, you can walk between without aggro and jump on the ledge...again, a glitch of some sort, without aggro on the skeletons...Once you jump the ledge, you can drop down, and see the ghost NPC (Gives great quest for possibly the best hunter helm next to MC/BWL epics of course) The last 2 pats are there..common to each side of the NPC.<br /><br />so there...take bout 30 mins out, farm 10 of em, get ur libram. I haven't gotten mine yet but fun finding new ghosts :)<br /><br />Good luck, lemme know if this little guide helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>DM WEST<br /><br />The trick is fear and banish.<br /><br />Kill the arcane elementals close to the pilons.<br /><br />Ok so the first pull is a hard one as it is a 3 pull.<br /><br />Banish one, and pull them to the door. Cast howl of terror, and now focus on 1 take him down as FAST AS YOU CAN, re fear him if needed. If shyt hits the fan and howl of terror is on cooldown, you can fear jugle 2 of the elementals. while having the third banished. If you dont think you can finish the three pull, just run outside sinc you should be close to the instance door.<br /><br />Easises way to do this is to get a banish timer, so you can rebanish immideatly after the mob breaks. Count Doom works fine.<br /><br />There is a big chance that you might die here, but at least try to take 1 out as all the other pylon pulls are just 2 pulls.<br /><br />DO NOT WORRY ABOUT FEARING THE ARCANE ELEMENTALS INTO THE TREE THINGS.<br /><br />If you have noticed carefully, mobs from different factions do not help eachother. therefore, you can fear them into eachother.<br /><br />You can also kill the invisible mobs easily, by fust kiting them around w/ DoT's and deathcoil if they get close, im guessing CoEx should work, but i dont have it. (However Deathcoil WONT work on UD mobs after 1.10)<br /><br />GL and good farming :)<br /><br />-Pookiez - 60 lock Eredar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>farm money to buy libram of focus instead of farming the libram itself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Alot harder to get than some of these people think. Id say its much easier to farm the gold, and then buy the damn libram.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Watch all the videos you like mates! Good luck! For real-life average lvl60 player DM west is not farmable solo. Granted, even I with my semi-epic mage can manage to kill some, but it is not farming! Uber characters from those videos have enough gold to buy those librams in AH. And dont think that they can do this all the time, every time.<br /><br />And the droprate for those is worse than ever! I have done more than 10 full DM west runs, killing all the mobs and never seen one of those drop.<br /><br />My advice - buy them in AH and get your money back buy selling if you get lucky and one finally drops for you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>For Priests, Post 1.10:</b><br /><br />It's still possibile to solo the 2 invisible ones on the balcony above the Tree boss, it's also possible to solo the 3 invisible ones and the 2 normal mobs in the hallway between the tree room and the dog room.<br /><br />It's also possible to take out those elemental packs (the tornadoes with one elite mixed in).&nbsp; My first attempt I was able to do it (sloppy but did it) by holy novaing the 3 adds and chain fearing the big dude while playing LOS games with him up and down the hall, bandaging and smiting.<br /><br />I'm not convinced that's worth the effort, but it's doable.<br /><br />The Pylon packs are doable as well, using the strat mentioned above for warlocks to break up the three pack, pain one, pull them to a door, fear, chain nuke the one mob and zone out.&nbsp; Come back in, use fear and take out the two packs from there on.&nbsp; They hit hard so there's little margin for error, LOS is the wild card that can make it possible to die.&nbsp; I'm not sure I'd try these packs without the ability to zone out, zoning out after each one would take a lot of the risk out of it.&nbsp; I can take the two at a time but I find myself using some kind of consumable to do it safely, be it a health pot, mana pot, or Desparate Prayer.<br /><br />Will see how some of the other packs go.&nbsp; The big tree dudes and the triple ghost packs aren't doable, IMO.&nbsp; The tree dudes can crit for half your life bar, and the ghost packs have silence.<br /><br />This is on an end game geared Priest, Disc/Holy dmg spec.&nbsp; Using the damage gear set from this profile: :&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://ctprofiles.net/16859" rel="nofollow">http://ctprofiles.net/16859</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got one from an Eldreth Spectre, solo farming with my priest.<br /><br />Yes , 1.10<br /><br />edit: a smart priest / player will be able to solo not only the 7 ghosts but also the Ironback Procectors and if you are lucky with the spawns you can solo one of the undead elf packs behind Tendris.<br /><br />Jump onto the ledge and nuke the (elite) caster down fast, once dead , the other mobs (elite) melee mob and two (non-elite) skeletons will be forced to run a long you to get to you. Once they come close to you shackle the (elite) melee guy and keep him shackled ( aka chain shackle ) and wait for the (non elite ) skeletons to reach you, kill them , they die fast , and finally kill the (elite) melee guy. Watch out tho, he hits really hard.<br /><br />Same goes for the Ironbark Protectors, aggro one using SW:P and jump onto the ledge, now use MB or Smite ( whatever ). Once he reaches you jump down ( he will knock you back if you are too slow :) ) run towards the ramp ( leading to Tendris ) , and jump onto to ledge again , repeat untill the mob is dead. btw. if he gets too close for comfort simply fear him away.<br /><br />cheers , have fun grinding.&nbsp; <br /><br />Edit : i am Disc/Holy specced :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Regarding the comment above on how to continue farming after getting through the <br />tunnel by the tree boss, I (SM/DS warlock, mostly epic geared) usually just banish <br />the arcane torrent, then kite the little guys back into the tunnel, dotting as i go.&nbsp; <br />One application each of CoA, Corruption, and Siphon Life will kill them, although <br />they will catch up to you (the key here is these are instacast, so I can cast while <br />running away).&nbsp; The groups of 3 are easy enough, I sometimes need to use a healthstone <br />or Death Coil just to keep my health at a non-dangerous level if it's a group of 4.&nbsp; <br />When they're dead, the banish is usually up, and the Arcane Torrent will be on you, I <br />just fear + dot him as usual.&nbsp; The thing here is that unlike at the first pylon, there <br />are plenty of things that will aggro you near the prison if your feared mob goes near <br />them, that's why it's better to go back into the tunnel for your chain fear on the Torrent.&nbsp; <br />Similarly, once you get to each pylon, I usually banish pull and kite the elementals back <br />into the library before chain fearing them.&nbsp; On the far pylon, you can even kite your guy <br />all the way back to the library and he'll be dead before he lays a finger on you (they <br />stupidly stop and try to cast spells on you as you're running, which lets you stay ahead).<br /><br />By the time you've cleared both pylons near the prison, the ghosts will have repopped in <br />the tunnel, you can kill them, and also the two pats on the upper level who will also have <br />repopped.&nbsp; If you're feeling up to it, it's possible to enter the right-side room and <br />go up the ramp (walk along the wall, and wait for the mobs to shift around away a bit <br />before running past -- you aren't guaranteed to get past without aggroing, but that's what <br />soul stones are for), go up the ramp, and you can kill several more ghost pats on the top <br />level.&nbsp; I've also cleared the pylon by the ramp (do the trick where you jump onto the ledge <br />surrounding the ramp opening to bypass the stationary mobs), but that pylon is a lot more <br />dangerous to clear because you can't really fear without aggroing the others.&nbsp; Personally, <br />I usually reset after clearing the first three pylons and the repops, takes about an hour <br />and 15 minutes once you have it down.&nbsp; Four librams sold on the auction house and counting <br />(and yes, I've had a libram drop off a spectre in 1.10).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just a FYI for mages, this is very easy to farm solo as well as the warlocks and priest. very very easy.</div>
