<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you really need the Recipe so you can make pots for the guild... get the guild to help you.<br /><br />Have one of the guild warlocks with 2 others stand where the guy that sells the recipe is, you go do the Zalazane quest in Sen'jin Village, get the Witch Doctor Troll there to cast the right Hex on you (the one with the drunk effect that lasts for 5:00) and BAM... have them summon you to it.&nbsp; You can get the recipe at the lowest possible level in a snap.&nbsp; Hell, you can pull a bunch of people down there and charge for the ride :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, this really does work!<br /><br />If u cant get a lock n' buddies to summon you, set your hearth to Tarren Mill, mount, and run north up the river to the town of Caer Darrow. Magnus Frostwake is in the building on the left when you walk into town. <br /><br />CAUTION: DO NOT try to swim across.....use the bridge! When ur this drunk you swim like a crippled turkey and haven't a hope in hell of making it. Take my advice :) Good luck!<br /><br />Ravenlok</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Having a mount when riding from Tarren Mill out to Caer Darrow to try and nab the recipe does make it alot easier, but isn't required.&nbsp; Its a very tight time squeese to make it from Tarren Mill to Caer Darrow in the 5 minute limit, but I was able to do it with a mage by using blink and 3 swiftness potions along the way, gave me about 5 seconds of time to nab the recipe from the vendor before he vanished.<br /><br />A hunter/shaman/druid could probably easy make this trip with their travel forms.&nbsp; Classes that don't have any kind of speed increasing abilities, like warriors and pallies, probably can't make this run on foot.</div>

I got there with about a minute to spare when using mount.&nbsp; Alch's also can get their Transmute Water to Air from the same ghost vendor.&nbsp; Pretty f'in cool!&nbsp; This method takes WAY less time than the Scholomance quest series for the trinket, which I can now get at my own relaxed pace.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I go to the spot where he is located on the map, but he is nowhere in sight...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How about a little parity! <br /><br />Below was cut and pasted; <br /><br />Any horde level 35+ can get and use this recipe fairly easily. <br /><br />(1) Bind at Tauren Mill <br />(2) Take the Zepplin to Orgrimmar, go south to Sen'jin village <br />(3) Do the Zalazane quest <br />(4) Talk to the troll in Sen'jin village that gives you random voodoo enchantments <br />(5) Keep talking to him and getting random enchantments until you get the 5 minute buff that makes your whole screen look fuzzy (drunk effect) and you see dancing hallucinations. <br />(6) Hearth to Tarren Mill <br />(7) Run up the river to scholomance (no hostile mobs along the way that would hinder you) <br />( Find the ghost inside one of the houses in Scholomance <br />(9) The run from Tarren Mill -&gt; Scholo is less than 2 minutes by 60% mount. Plenty of time to do it before buff wears off. <br /><br />The enchant you want is &quot;Special Brew&quot;. <br /><br />Of course nothing equivalent exists for Alliance. <br /><br />Edited to be a little bit more correct. Damn Ally's just don't know what we need to actually do. *sigh*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tried the trick but when I got to the house there was no one in there. Does this still work since the most recent patch?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There is a really nice guide of getting &quot;attuned&quot; in an hour or 3.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Has anyone tried chatting with this NPC with an eye of divinity equipped? The Spectral essence reveals the priest epic quest npc, so it's possible the EoD would reveal this npc.<br /><br />I'll test it if I ever get an EoD....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there is no vendor at the entrance. where do you mean?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You must have the brew to be able to see this guy, when you enter scholo at the gates he is at the werry first house to the left , cant miss it and he is in the middle of it cant miss him either , took me 4min to do this :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wimbleton</b></h3>Magnus Frostwake is nowhere to be found, either at the location show on the map or anywhere near it. I guess nobody's job is safe these days.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lazko</b></h3>Hi<br /><br />Guys just use the Item: Spectral Essence and you will be able to find <u>Magnus Frostwake. Location-68.1, 77.8</u></div>
