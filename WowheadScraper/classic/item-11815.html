These are initial perceptions, and it will take parsing a lot more logs to be confident that these are fact, rather than initial observations:\n\n[ul]\n  [li]The order of attacks shown in the combat log seems to not be a good way to determine which attack caused and which attack resulted in the Hand of Justice proc.&nbsp; If you really want to see what is going on, you need to use \/combatlog&nbsp; This&nbsp; causes your combat log to be recorded to a text file for later perusal, and, more importantly, applies timestamps with thousandths of a second.&nbsp; I made some assumptions that turned out to be wrong when I just used JoChatTimestamp and watched the combat log in game.\n[\/li]\n  [li]If you duel wield, offhand attacks seem to cause mainhand procs most of the time.&nbsp; I'm going to need to go through some more logs to see if this initial result is accurate; my sample size is way too low to be sure right now.&nbsp; Initially, though, this is good news for duel wielders, since a fast offhand weapon can be used to trigger more powerful mainhand procs.\n[\/li]\n  [li]Hand of Justice can proc on Eviscerate, Riposte, Ghostly Strike, and Sinister Strike.\n[\/li]\n  [li]In my first test, I had one and only one case I could guarantee the Hand of Justice proc applied the Instant Poison on my mainhand.&nbsp; I would have expected it to happen a couple of more times than that, but, again, my sample size is pretty low.\n[\/li]\n  [li]If your attack is parried, it can still cause Hand of Justice to proc; I'm still looking to see if this is also true of blocks\/misses\/dodges.\n[\/li]\n  [li]I haven't seen a case where I can prove that Crusader procced off a Hand of Justice proc.&nbsp; I'm expecting this to be true, but with the stuff Blizzard screws around with behind the scenes in each patch, I'm going to have to see it to believe it.&nbsp; It shouldn't take too long to find out, though, since I just need it to proc off a mainhand proc caused by an offhand attack (since my offhand isn't enchanted with Crusader).\n[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n\nI'll come back and edit this with any further findings.","date":"2006-01-25T11:05:22-06:00","rating":59,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"He never came back...","creationdate":"2020-06-20T01:18:47-05:00","id":1375436,"rating":40,"commentid":2686062,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"alexiovay","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Ayyad","importedSubject":"Some testing"},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"id":2686093,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"This has been a blessing in disguise.

If you don't use the key you can go out the first window and wait for the mob to path, otherwise jump out the second and try not to take a lava bath. Kill Incendious (bonus). Take a leap SW off his platform into the lava. Run along that wall until you get near the first big island. Head over to it and skirt the sides to avoid the Lava mobs. Take another swim to the wall West of the island and skirt it until you can't. Now you have the long swim to the 4 lava mob island.

Every melee character in my guild grinds through BRD repeatedly for it since it is not only as good as an epic, it is nearly as rare. My Rogue was blessed with one while aiding some lower levels with another guildmate. It really helps with both attack power and the amazing chance for an extra swing. I switched off both my Maelstrom card and Seal trinkets which I had been shifting between for it, and it was definitely the right choice.\n\nSimply put - this is one of the very best melee trinkets in the game, easily the best blue, and there is not a single fighter-type who does not benefit from it. \n\nTo put things in comparison: The Heart of Hakkar melee trinket (assuming you swing enough times to fully utilize the bonus decay within the duration) adds a maximum adition of 420 damage as a use, as opposed to a passive effect. As soon as your white damage, including whatever you normally wear on your blades (Poisons, sharpening stones and enchants) exceeds that number this trinket outpaces the epic reward easily. An extra swing can crit or be part of another proc, the Hakkar effect cannot do either.  \n\nThe only shame is that you have to grind BRD for it, and no one likes doing that. No, you cannot solo for it, as the boss has adds and summons more  after the fight. On the bright side you have to go back to BRD a hundred times over your character's lifespan for various reasons, so you can always stop by the boss and take a stab at it.\n\nEdited, Sat Feb 25 06:52:42 2006","date":"2006-02-25T13:43:14-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"2 combat rogues with _decent_ equip can gangbang him, 3 should be able to do it easily.\n\ndid it with a guildmate, both combat specc'd, one dagger and one sword rogue.\n\n1 rogue starts, fires evasion, flurry, adrenalin rush and just bashes away, after a few swings the next rogue goes for it. be prepared to swallow a thistle tea and a healing pot to make it easier.\n\nin 10 tries we only failed twice due to the lack of applying instant poison, which definitly helps a lot either.","creationdate":"2006-03-03T02:54:59-06:00","id":1270952,"rating":0,"commentid":3036541,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"koaschten","importedSubject":"RE: ^.^"},{"body":"[quote]An extra swing can crit or be part of another proc [\/quote]\n\nThat is so true, glad some people are finally starting to catch on to the extra hit deal.

After some trial and errors, we thought that he should pop his AR 5 seconds after I pop AR so that after I feint he can take the aggro.

Whether you're getting an extra hit with a Dal Rend blade or an Ancient Qiraji Ripper, or even the 284 DPS Main hand in WoW's 4th expansion, an extra hit always scales with the weapons.<br /><br />This really shines when you take tons of hits, like a rogue or fury warrior or even certain pally styles. Although not much is better than a free instant second 2h hit, there are simply fewer chances to get that 2% to proc with a slower weapon.<br /><br />If you get this and don't use it for a while, keep it anyways, when BC comes out it might be the only one of it's kind.<br /><br />Also, it stacks with all other super-haste/instant swing items/spells/abilities.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>639</b></h3>Since patch 2.0, the equip on this item was changed to a 'chance' to gain an extra hit, instead of a '2% chance'. This change might reflect that it won't scale as well anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>frmrpreztaft</b></h3>As a raiding warrior with MC/BWL dps gear, i can say tha this is one of THE BEST (if not the best) melee DPS trinkets out there. HoJ + Sword Spec + Windfury Totem = WTFDMG. <br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for any Melee class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kcorb</b></h3>I used this constantly on my Rogue when I was PvE Sword Spec.<br /><br />HoJ+Blade Flurry+Adrenaline Rush+Sinister Strike Spam =WTFDMGOUTPUT</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SignupSucks</b></h3>Does this effect work with attacks in druid forms? The convention it follows makes me believe it does, but I am not certain, as I've never heard of a druid with one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25643</b></h3>This thing should be marked orange, I use it still at 70 with my lionheart blade and sword spec. I've had 2 extra attack right after another a countless times. I need to find a very very good trinket before this thing gets replaced. Really no matter what lvl you are, go get this trinket as warrior , rogue whatever.<br /><br />It should be a legendary item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>28406</b></h3>Invaluable. <br /><br />&quot;Chance on hit&quot; is around 5%. The following is from wowwiki. Even though it states that it's a weapon property, the article describes the same statistic applied to Paladin seals and other items.<br /><br />&quot;A property of a weapon that has a power with a chance of activating on each hit. Sometimes the chance is listed as a percentage (%). Most often there is no direct indication of how often that &quot;chance&quot; occurs. Although there is no official documentation on how often a Chance on Hit works, or proc's, around 5% sounds likely.&quot;<br /><br />When I was 60, I used the Halberd of Smiting which had the chance on hit to decapitate your target for ~600 damage. Same thing as the Doomsaw at level 60. Chance on hit was definitely more than 2%, which is what this trinket used to be.<br /><br />One of the old benefits of this trinket being +2% (though now it's been changed to chance on hit) was that it could be added to the sword skill % increase, plus the sword spec talent % increase. However, changing this to &quot;Chance on Hit&quot; benefits all classes now.<br /><br />As a sword spec HUMAN warrior with the racial ability for extra sword skill as well as the arms talent spec that adds additional weapon skill, with this trinket, I proc extra attacks all the time at level 70. Even though this trinket is a separate percentage that is not added in with the sword skill, but it's own proc, It still kicks in on a regular basis.<br /><br />I can't imagine throwing this away ever.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>30275</b></h3>here are my procwatch results:<br /><br />hits :575<br />procs :14<br />time 09:18 (for those unfamiliar with procwatch, that is the time in-combat only)<br />hits/proc :41<br />procs/min :1.5<br /><br />so that would be 14 procs out of 575 hits giving 2.4% proc. of course its going to vary but unless those were extremely lucky 9:18 minutes of in-combat time, the proc rate doesnt seem to have changed much from the original 2% chance. at least for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bojo</b></h3>Thottbot says it can be dropped from General angerforge too, not only the emperor. You need the key to get to him thou. To get the key, you must die, Talk to a Forgewright in Forgewright's tomb inside BRM, take the quest, listen to his story, then you get a quest to go inside BRD, and the reward is the key to Angerforge. If he CAN drop the key, it's better to farm Angerforge rather than emperor. (im talking about lvl 70 solo if you want this trinket)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm doing some analysis on this trinket, after getting it this weekend.<br /><br />I'm still going over combat logs, but here are a few observations.&nbsp; These are initial perceptions, and it will take parsing a lot more logs to be confident that these are fact, rather than initial observations:<br /><br /><ul><li>The order of attacks shown in the combat log seems to not be a good way to determine which attack caused and which attack resulted in the Hand of Justice proc.&nbsp; If you really want to see what is going on, you need to use /combatlog&nbsp; This&nbsp; causes your combat log to be recorded to a text file for later perusal, and, more importantly, applies timestamps with thousandths of a second.&nbsp; I made some assumptions that turned out to be wrong when I just used JoChatTimestamp and watched the combat log in game.<br /></li><li>If you duel wield, offhand attacks seem to cause mainhand procs most of the time.&nbsp; I'm going to need to go through some more logs to see if this initial result is accurate; my sample size is way too low to be sure right now.&nbsp; Initially, though, this is good news for duel wielders, since a fast offhand weapon can be used to trigger more powerful mainhand procs.<br /></li><li>Hand of Justice can proc on Eviscerate, Riposte, Ghostly Strike, and Sinister Strike.<br /></li><li>In my first test, I had one and only one case I could guarantee the Hand of Justice proc applied the Instant Poison on my mainhand.&nbsp; I would have expected it to happen a couple of more times than that, but, again, my sample size is pretty low.<br /></li><li>If your attack is parried, it can still cause Hand of Justice to proc; I'm still looking to see if this is also true of blocks/misses/dodges.<br /></li><li>I haven't seen a case where I can prove that Crusader procced off a Hand of Justice proc.&nbsp; I'm expecting this to be true, but with the stuff Blizzard screws around with behind the scenes in each patch, I'm going to have to see it to believe it.&nbsp; It shouldn't take too long to find out, though, since I just need it to proc off a mainhand proc caused by an offhand attack (since my offhand isn't enchanted with Crusader).<br /></li></ul><br /><br />I'll come back and edit this with any further findings.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This has been a blessing in disguise. I went on two runs the other day and both times the Hand dropped. I don't know if that's a testiment to the increased drop rate or the luck of our group, but I see it as nearly impossible happening before the patch.<br /><br />An easy way to get to the Emp is such: Go through the Garrisons and drop out the window onto the platform below the Shadowforge gate. If you don't use the key you can go out the first window and wait for the mob to path, otherwise jump out the second and try not to take a lava bath. Kill Incendious (bonus). Take a leap SW off his platform into the lava. Run along that wall until you get near the first big island. Head over to it and skirt the sides to avoid the Lava mobs. Take another swim to the wall West of the island and skirt it until you can't. Now you have the long swim to the 4 lava mob island. Get to it, skirt or fight the mobs there and then head to the ramp to the MC bridge. After that just run West and turn right and you're at the Lyceum. Mobs are non-elite and insanely easy. Work your way up one side. Light torch, across to the other, open door, clear room, kill Emp and claim HoJ.<br /><br />About 20 minutes flat with good group.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In the subject you said a fast way to emp, but at the end of your comment you said to kill Angerforge.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Since I think sword talent and this proc are individual and you guys know nothing about math, scoring a double attack does not have 2% + 6% chance.<br /><br />It would be this:<br />1 - (0.98 * 0.94) = 0.0788 = 7.88%</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well nice math you did there but what you have to realise is that when your considering such low numbers the difference is nothing, lets take my warrior for example base white dmg of 500 if he does that over 100 hits and gets 2 procs, then we have 5% extra swing from sword proc meaning 7% chance thats 7 swings extra out of 100, im horde and i get wf so this is even better,<br /><br />Ignoring the math any swing no matter how low the proc chance is imba take a look at sword spec for example people will drop axes with there extra crit chance specced for a mere 5% extra swing because hitting someone again is nasty as hell compared to measly crit chance<br /><br />just my 2 cents</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>my friend rogue and me killed angeforge over 30 times and finaly the trinket droped for my friend<br />he was a combat rogue ( adrenaline rush + blade flurry ) and me survival hunter. i can run trought all the brd mobs using feing death and shadowmeld. we sometimes killed him uberfast and have time to run away and stealth from the mobs that come when he is on low hp, but most of the times we just killed him, loot and die to adds but thats no problem because his drops pay easily our repair bills</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">this is the best trinket for one handed i think </div> <br />2handers generaly do more damage and seeing how its a 2% chance to get a free instant attack, a 2hander gets the most for your money.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This trinket is spectacular. Every melee character in my guild grinds through BRD repeatedly for it since it is not only as good as an epic, it is nearly as rare. My Rogue was blessed with one while aiding some lower levels with another guildmate. It really helps with both attack power and the amazing chance for an extra swing. I switched off both my Maelstrom card and Seal trinkets which I had been shifting between for it, and it was definitely the right choice.<br /><br />Simply put - this is one of the very best melee trinkets in the game, easily the best blue, and there is not a single fighter-type who does not benefit from it. <br /><br />To put things in comparison: The Heart of Hakkar melee trinket (assuming you swing enough times to fully utilize the bonus decay within the duration) adds a maximum adition of 420 damage as a use, as opposed to a passive effect. As soon as your white damage, including whatever you normally wear on your blades (Poisons, sharpening stones and enchants) exceeds that number this trinket outpaces the epic reward easily. An extra swing can crit or be part of another proc, the Hakkar effect cannot do either. <br /><br />The only shame is that you have to grind BRD for it, and no one likes doing that. No, you cannot solo for it, as the boss has adds and summons more after the fight. On the bright side you have to go back to BRD a hundred times over your character's lifespan for various reasons, so you can always stop by the boss and take a stab at it.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Feb 25 06:52:42 2006</div>

We 4-manned this most of the time and became experts at this boss.<br /><br />We didn't do this the whole day every day but a couple of hours every day and it was very fun. The rogue got this trinket and some blues and one epic dropped from random mobs as well as loads of green items.<br /><br />Do not expect this to drop lightly, it does require more than 20 runs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The thing here is, that.. EHEHEHE.<br /><br />&quot;Passive: 2% chance on hit to gain 1 extra attack. <br />Passive: +20 Attack Power.&quot;<br /><br />Well it doens't say 'Use' or 'Equip' which means you can have it in your inventory and still use the other 2 trinkets you wan't instead! <br /><br />For the &quot;Edit: The main reason being that almost everyone will default Blackhand's Breadth and the PvP Trinket almost all of the time.&quot;<br /><br />And If you are a rogue / dual-wield warrior you would hope more for <a href="/classic/item=11817/lord-generals-sword">Lord General's Sword</a> which I had and it procced when it should. But you only keep it till you have Dal'rend MH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As an average, 2% chance for an extra hit is equivalent to a basic increase of melee-based DPS by 2%.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Let's do the math:<br /><br />If you do 100 hits over 100 seconds of 10 damage per hit, over the 100 hits, your damage is 1000 points for a basic damage per second of 10. How quaint.<br /><br />If you do 100 hits, a 2% chance should go off twice, for two extra hits. Now, we've done 102 hits over 100 seconds of 10 damage each for a total of 1020 damage. That makes a damage per second rating of 10.2.<br /><br />First example's damage of 10 increased by 2% equals... *drumroll* 10.2! Awesome! Can I get a 'woot woot'?<br /><br />While this is a very nifty trinket, it is possible to do better.<br /><br />For the people who think this post is too sarcastic, please realize that not everyone sees the numbers without actually seeing the numbers.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Feb 25 12:42:32 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i was lucky this time, or the drop chance is much higher now, cuz the very first emp run i do in 1.10 it dropped.<br /><br />been doing several angerforge runs in the past but never seen it drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm farming this items for weeks now, never seen it drop... does it matter if the princess survives or not?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The proc scales with gear, which is what makes this trink so great. Even if the 20 AP bonus becomes less and less noticeable, the extra attack will benefit you all the same, even as your gear becomes better and better. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Still don't have it. Well over 50 runs, doing everything from 2-manning with a rogue (I'm a warrior) to stopping by on pre-MC attunement raids.<br /><br />I'm gonna cry</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>% to procs do not add. Having 6% from the talent and this does not give 8% to happen. If you have 50% chance of heads or tails, flipping a coin twice does not give you 100%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I heard it's a really rare drop from Angerforge and a more common drop from Emperor.<br /><br />I would like to get this info confirmed, but that'll have to wait... :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd dump my Blackhand's breath (+2% crit) , or maybe the Darkmoon Maelstorm card (chance to deal 200-300 nature damage on hit) to get this baby. Its great for pve dps, especially in those looong boss fights during which all I'm doing is hacking away on a boss's ankle the entire time. <br /><br />I don't think its worth using for pvp though, I'd prolly swap out the Maelstorm card and this trink when Im doing pvp or pve, respectively.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SloneWarrior</b></h3>We defeated Angerforge about 10 times last night and haven't seen this drop. I'm starting to think that the Emperor is the one actually holding on to this. Has anyone confirmed a drop in Classic 2019?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FozzyNA</b></h3>Hot tip for rogues/druids looking to get this in Classic: If you get a group of 2 other stealthy friends you can all sneak in and 3-man Angerforge. A rogue can distract the adds that come in from the stairs and you can stealth away without fighting them as soon as you kill and loot the boss. The drop chance is low so it can take a while for everyone to get one but it's more reliable and faster than finding new groups constantly and having to roll against different people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FozzyNA</b></h3>This CAN proc in druid forms. I saw a lot of conflicting information on whether or not it would but I just finally got and tested it: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nGiSFwX.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/nGiSFwX.png</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ru5k0</b></h3>I'd just like to share my experience, as I felt like I have done nothing but run this dungeon over and over and over and over...<br /><br />After precisely 107 General Angerforge kills, he dropped Hand of Justice 3 times. Finally got it after the 3rd drop.<br /><br />3/107 * 100 = 2.8%<br /><br />The approximation of a 3% droprate seems to be accurate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>OCEgotscrewed</b></h3>The drop rate is @#$%ing garbage 100 runs and havent seen the #$%^ing thing</div>

Thanks to my guildmate feral druid we can 2 man it and make it possible!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Reydz</b></h3>Me - combat rogue, sword spec. Currently at 106 runs farming it, only one drop in total - lost to a warrior, no drop after that. I'm hopeless. It seems that everyone I inspect has the trinket equipped, warriors, other rogues, even HUNTERS... The drop rate is so broken, some people got it in 5 runs, a friend of mine did actually 15 runs and saw it drop twice. Breaks my heart to read comments of other people that got it on their frist run. Is there any WoW justice? I cannot be the only one being so unlucky, or am I?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fabi88</b></h3>Finally got mine after close to 100 runs. Easy 2 man farm with my warrior &amp; guildie healer (both MC Geared). Approx 17-20 mins per run without skipping or glitching, just following the main route and clearing arena on the way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cerbyzarre</b></h3>A discovery: not only does it proc for feral druids, if you're spamming Maul in bear form the second hit can also be a Maul. Might work similarly with other &quot;next melee&quot; abilities from other classes?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>windsing</b></h3>my rogue was duo farming this with another rogue and we got 2 dropped after 44 runs. Here are some tips for those who also want to duo farm it:<br /><br />1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E85USEsWcMk" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E85USEsWcMk</a> This video really helps. My following items only complement this video.<br />2. we don't have riposte spec'ed but I think it would be better to have it because sometimes RNG just fk you and angerforge kills you within 3 hits even though you have evasion up<br />3. bring a lot of health potion since they are very cheap but can save your lives when RNG is really bad<br />4. we were having problems with our threats where angerforge doesn't switch to another rogue when my evasion is over because his threat is too low. After some trial and errors, we thought that he should pop his AR 5 seconds after I pop AR so that after I feint he can take the aggro. You can adjust this time based on your DPS difference.<br />5. bring a lot of thistle tea<br />6. when RNG is really bad, just vanish and wait for cooldown resets</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Artemisdk</b></h3>Heres som drop confirmation and some fresh tips/info...<br /><br />Soloed Angerforge 40+ times with no drop... Last night my buddy and I duo´ed him and after around 10 runs it finally dropped for me... We did 3 more runs and it dropped for my buddy aswell... We where ecstatic to say it mildly :D<br /><br />I watched Zatar´s awesome sologuide before doing them myself: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojlo66XC5qg" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojlo66XC5qg</a><br /><br />I startet soloing him in full blue with Sword of Zeal and Hanzo as off... It was tough but was doable with allot of bandages, Major HP pot, Stam food, Rumsey Rum stam buff, Greater agi elixier and an occasional Fort buff from priests... I used Drakefire Amulet and Onyx cape for the Destroyers and where able to fully resist allot of fireballs I couldnt glitch out of.<br /><br />The investment in the buff food/pots paid off (especially in the beginning) as the runs where allot more consistent. It does give a good chunk of gold and I actually still made profit inspite of buying them from AH...<br /><br />As my gear got better I could kill him faster and allot more consistently without dying. The first runs took about 25 min and I was around 15min with blue pre bis gear with 3 T1 pieces and ZG shoulders... Still with same weaps.<br /><br />Bring a fellow rogue/drood and breeze through him in about 10 min pr. run...<br /><br />Happy hunting :)... and and you might wanna hurry, HoJ will move to Emperor in phase 5, not sure that will be soloable...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lomkail</b></h3>Just got it. But it dropped from &quot;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&quot;</div>
