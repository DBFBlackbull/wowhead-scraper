As a lot of the other comments from antiquity have said, doing Scarlet Monastery: Graveyard is an excellent way to stock up on them. You'll need Fadeleaf as well, so you may as well do Armoury and Library while you're at it. Cathedral as well if you're so inclined, for the Goldthorn and Liferoot. All nodes can give 1-3 herbs.\n\nAs a level 60, it's pretty easy to skip all the mobs due to the giga level disparty, especially if you have access to stealth. I'm farming on a mage, so you can blink through any particularly cluttered hallway of mobs (Library is the main offender here).\n\nGraveyard has three herb spawns, which can be any combination of Grave Moss and Kingsblood. Kingsblood is mostly useless, and it's possible that you can have three Kingsblood spawns and no Grave Moss (and the reverse is also true!).\n\nCathedral has two Goldthorn spawns; one on each level, and one Liferoot spawn, which can spawn on either level in the water.\n\nArmoury has one Fadeleaf spawn, which is in courtyard as you walk in. It can either spawn at the very start, or near the end.\n\nLibrary has one Fadeleaf spawn in its courtyard, and a Liferoot in the little boss room of Houndmaster Locksey, if you're so inclined. \n\nIt took me between about 5m5s and 5m25s to herb all four wings - it can be easy to aggro a mob if you're not paying or attention or are being particularly ballsy. I imagine this would take maybe six minutes for other classes, especially on a druid or rogue that has to deal with the debilitating stealth movement penalty. I'd also avoid attempting to grab the chest in the first boss room of Graveyard, as it will auto-aggro the pack next to it.\n\nAnother comment talked about Alliance post-Graveyard farming, so here's a Horde version (it's probably bad, but it's a start). I have my hearth set to Grom'gol, and I hoon up to and around the Ruins of Zul'Kunda, then down to Lake Nazferiti and then up to Duskwood. Sometimes you'll get lucky and find some Fadeleaf, sometimes not. Then, I go west in Duskwood to Raven Hill Cemetery and go up and down each side to get Grave Moss; I'll usually find 2-3 nodes.\n\nAnd obviously you'll need Dreamleaf, but that's easy and I'm sure you'll manage finding some.\n\nGood luck to anyone else prepping Greater Shadow Protection potions for phase 5\/6!","date":"2020-06-25T10:17:09-05:00","rating":40,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2020-06-25T10:20:48-05:00",4,"Pelican420"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":43,"id":3216732,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Trillawnie","body":"Kodo Graveyard in Desolace and Raven Hill Cemetary in Duskwood.

I often have runs where there have been 6 Grave Moss nodes out of 15 per hour, and 1 Grave Moss per node was the most frequent pick. If you are happy to use your daily account resets on Grave Moss alone, by all means, SM GY is about as good as any place for it. \r\n\r\nDesolace: there are 25 Grave Moss only nodes scattered between the outer edges of and paths of Desolace as well as in the Kodo Graveyard - though the biggest cluster is in the graveyard (11 nodes) you’re not always guaranteed spawns. If you are camping the GY for Moss, you have a smaller chance of spawning new nodes, as there is very very rarely more than 1 node up at any one time in the GY, so you are partly relying on other players farming Grave Moss nodes elsewhere on the map. If you are the only person farming Grave Moss in Desolace and your camp the graveyard, you will most likely see the least amount of active spawns. Many people do not realise this. When you are the only person farming Grave Moss in Desolace and you hit every node on the map, you will find x4 nodes per map clear. This is anything from 4-12 Grave Moss per round, and it takes about 6-7 minutes. If someone is farming GY only, you can pick up between 2-3 nodes around the map. Doing full clears of Desolace for Grave Moss yields you the most Moss per hour if you are able to commit the time.","date":"2020-12-08T11:52:56-06:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}}];

(left gate)<br />For level 60 it's easy to bypass everything and loot the Grave moss. Then run out and reset the instance.

Better look out.<br /><br />Mount to Wetlands (Ironbeards tomb). One plant above and one inside. 3 pieces. Not very much.<br /><br />Another good place is Kodo graveyard.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pelican420</b></h3>There's a lot of good information here, but no post really synthesises the information nicely.<br /><br />Grave moss is used for Greater Shadow Protection potions, and you're likely wanting to stock up on it (and Fadeleaf) to make them for phase 5 and 6. As a lot of the other comments from antiquity have said, doing Scarlet Monastery: Graveyard is an excellent way to stock up on them. You'll need Fadeleaf as well, so you may as well do Armoury and Library while you're at it. Cathedral as well if you're so inclined, for the Goldthorn and Liferoot. All nodes can give 1-3 herbs.<br /><br />As a level 60, it's pretty easy to skip all the mobs due to the giga level disparty, especially if you have access to stealth. I'm farming on a mage, so you can blink through any particularly cluttered hallway of mobs (Library is the main offender here).<br /><br />Graveyard has three herb spawns, which can be any combination of Grave Moss and Kingsblood. Kingsblood is mostly useless, and it's possible that you can have three Kingsblood spawns and no Grave Moss (and the reverse is also true!).<br /><br />Cathedral has two Goldthorn spawns; one on each level, and one Liferoot spawn, which can spawn on either level in the water.<br /><br />Armoury has one Fadeleaf spawn, which is in courtyard as you walk in. It can either spawn at the very start, or near the end.<br /><br />Library has one Fadeleaf spawn in its courtyard, and a Liferoot in the little boss room of Houndmaster Locksey, if you're so inclined. <br /><br />It took me between about 5m5s and 5m25s to herb all four wings - it can be easy to aggro a mob if you're not paying or attention or are being particularly ballsy. I imagine this would take maybe six minutes for other classes, especially on a druid or rogue that has to deal with the debilitating stealth movement penalty. I'd also avoid attempting to grab the chest in the first boss room of Graveyard, as it will auto-aggro the pack next to it.<br /><br />Another comment talked about Alliance post-Graveyard farming, so here's a Horde version (it's probably bad, but it's a start). I have my hearth set to Grom'gol, and I hoon up to and around the Ruins of Zul'Kunda, then down to Lake Nazferiti and then up to Duskwood. Sometimes you'll get lucky and find some Fadeleaf, sometimes not. Then, I go west in Duskwood to Raven Hill Cemetery and go up and down each side to get Grave Moss; I'll usually find 2-3 nodes.<br /><br />And obviously you'll need Dreamleaf, but that's easy and I'm sure you'll manage finding some.<br /><br />Good luck to anyone else prepping Greater Shadow Protection potions for phase 5/6!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Trillawnie</b></h3>Kodo Graveyard in Desolace and Raven Hill Cemetary in Duskwood. Between those two spots I easily made enough money on the AH in a few days to buy my first mount. In Desolace I wasn't even really farming, I was just questing in the area and would stop by to check here and there. I went to Raven Hill for the first time today since I had my hearth set to Gromgol - I got 13 grave moss on my level 36 hunter in about an hour. They sell for around 1 g each on my server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hyperping</b></h3>There are 10 Grave Moss nodes in the Kodo Graveyard, Desolace. 2 spawns can be active at once on a 10-15 minute respawn timer. There are also 4 other locations where there are single node spawns around Desolace. Not a bad place to hit and do a circle around the zone because you can also pick up quite a few Gromsblood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Innocentxxx</b></h3>Any Grave Moss node (just like any herb node with exception of Ghost Mushrooms and Lotuses) can spawn between 1-3 Grave Moss. <br /><br />Here’s a review of the two main sources: SM GY and Desolace (Desolace if done right is far better Grave Moss per hour than SM but more on that later.)<br /><br />SM GY: though you’re guaranteed x3 nodes, RNG will determine wether it’s Grave Moss or Kingsblood but overall, the chance of there being a Grave Moss node is smaller than, and the number of Moss you receiver generally is lower as well. I often have runs where there have been 6 Grave Moss nodes out of 15 per hour, and 1 Grave Moss per node was the most frequent pick. If you are happy to use your daily account resets on Grave Moss alone, by all means, SM GY is about as good as any place for it. <br /><br />Desolace: there are 25 Grave Moss only nodes scattered between the outer edges of and paths of Desolace as well as in the Kodo Graveyard - though the biggest cluster is in the graveyard (11 nodes) you’re not always guaranteed spawns. If you are camping the GY for Moss, you have a smaller chance of spawning new nodes, as there is very very rarely more than 1 node up at any one time in the GY, so you are partly relying on other players farming Grave Moss nodes elsewhere on the map. If you are the only person farming Grave Moss in Desolace and your camp the graveyard, you will most likely see the least amount of active spawns. Many people do not realise this. When you are the only person farming Grave Moss in Desolace and you hit every node on the map, you will find x4 nodes per map clear. This is anything from 4-12 Grave Moss per round, and it takes about 6-7 minutes. If someone is farming GY only, you can pick up between 2-3 nodes around the map. Doing full clears of Desolace for Grave Moss yields you the most Moss per hour if you are able to commit the time.</div>
