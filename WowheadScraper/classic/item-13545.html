<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They're for a Horde quest.&nbsp; You have to get 5 (2 now, since the patch) of these special fish to someone at Ghostwalker Post.&nbsp; The guy on the dock trades you 5 shellfish for 1 fish, so you'll need 10 of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you go to 19,81 there is a deep area with a bubbly fissure in it. Swim near it and you can breathe from that and not ahve to surface, there are two traps within eyeshot of that fissure and they spawn fast enough that you can get the needed shellfish in no time. I learned this hoping to get an iron fishing pole as this was the one place known to drop them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been at this for at least a half an hour and I found a convenient (and cheap) way to breathe underwater. Ok so it was written into the game, but hey I haven't seen it mentioned here. <br /><br />a little ways out from the dock are some bubbling cracks on the sea floor, swim towards one and if you enter the bubble stream you'll be able to sit there and fight the nasty humanoids down there without the worry of drowning :)<br /><br />Go to a bubble stream, open a trap, go back to bubble stream, open another trap. Quite convenient, indeed; and much cheaper then underwater-breathing potions :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Warlocks have Underwater Breathing. We can breathe underwater for 10 minutes. GG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Am I missing something or can these only be used for a horde quest?<br /><br />If that's the case, I wish there was a cooking recipe for these. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had a druid friend of mine tell me I (myself being a druid) could get one in 10-30 mins, but I was camping those damn traps for 2.5 hours and didn't get anything... just find an auction house and buy one for 15g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah... the drop rate is crazy... last night I got 3 in less than 1 hour... today 2 hours and nothing... dont know what the drop rate is ties to as a variable... maybe how many times that trap has been hit? Or how many times you have gotten something from that loc?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After 3.5 hours I finnaly got 1 with 104 shellfish :*(.&nbsp; I am not just ranting thogh.&nbsp; I want to know is there any use for these thind for allance or is your best best just AH them on an allance horde or vendering.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sorry u can not vender them</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So I ran around collecting these crates being friendly to the horde until I had collected 72 shellfish and 4 or so greys.&nbsp; It was about at that point I got inpatient, killed the two horde in the water and went into the town killing another 5 including an AFK shammy at the flight path.&nbsp; Went back down next cage I opened had a nice green and the next one the Iron fishing rod.<br /><br />So if it's not dropping, try killin off some horde and taking their lucky charms.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>51 shellfish, dozens of dead crab-monsters, a stack of underwater breathing; wand of eventide, rusted parts, boots, and scales....<br /><br />no pole.<br /><br />The crabs do hand out decent loot, and that wand isn't anything to sneeze at.&nbsp; I'll pass it on to my priest, and he'll get a bit more respect..<br /><br />Did give an opportunity to open the flight path to Feathermoon Stronghold though.<br /><br />Maybe I'll go back when I've got a few more levels on those crabs.&nbsp; At 34; they can be tough when they double team you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, so by now i have enough shellfish to open a Red Lobster, and enough boots to open a Foot Locker next to it.&nbsp; I have also killed enough of the Crayfish things that i am pretty sure they are hunting me for war crimes... but what i dont have is a Fishing Pole... but like they say, anything worth haveing...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me about 15 minutes to find the pole, it wasnt bad, just bring a breathing potion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After 55mins, and just after I got sick of these traps, it popped up. I was happy now. Used a potion and it worked out in the end.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The worst thing is, these have no value at all.&nbsp; They should be flagged as a quest item only, or at least have SOME sell value.<br /><br />I've been searching these traps for over an hour for a pole and not ONE... if you got one quickly, you're very lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If your a person who is finding mount money a pain this may be a good solution. It may not be the most effective method for money but at 55s per 5 this is an fair way to make money you can pick up 20 in about 5-8 minutes with no competition and water breathing pots so thats 2g 20s every 10 minutes and <b>13g</b> every hour making it indeed possible to get a mount within the space of a few hours and a level.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>opened like 200 traps, was going to quit after about 100 but at this point i was determined to get the fishing pole, well i finally got it.&nbsp; Reward is more exciting when it takes longer!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If ya got a shaman good to use here, they can cast underwater breathing and the crab dudes you kill down there drop the reagent you need Shiney Fish Scales</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I spent 2 hours with my priest in her upper 40s and never found the fishing pole.&nbsp; I had stacks and stacks of shellfish, but no pole.&nbsp; <br /><br />And all I wanted was the fishing pole.&nbsp; I just destroyed the shellfish since I had no use for them being a NightElf.&nbsp; But I really wish I could get better luck for that pole since I hated paying the prices on the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It should be noted that Big Iron Fishing Pole drops here...<br /><br />Everybody can swim out and open the cages, I had the insane luck of getting two poles in 15 minutes and none the next hour.<br /><br />Alliance have no use for the shellfish, though - try to sell them at Gadgetzan or BB AH.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 6th 2006 at 6:25pm PST by lisalodahl</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I had a couple left over as you can only hand them in in bunches of 5. Tried putting them in the AH at Thunder Bluff but it says I can't sell them..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone know a good spot to farm these shellfish other than the cages off the coast of shadowprey village?</div>
