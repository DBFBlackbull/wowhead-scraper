It might have been used as well by the original programmers of diku-MUD. spec_proc is short for \"special procedure\". Special procedures in Circle-MUD are functions that can be assigned to objects, players, and locations in the world such that each time an event occurs, the special procedure function will be invoked. Special procedures were used in Circle-MUD for a wide variety of purposes: Creating room events when a person typed a specific string of text, causing a weapon or piece of armor to perform a magical action, and even causing a MOB (mobile) to do something that it wouldn't normally do. \n\nSpecial procedures were a way of creating unique experiences that could not be achieved by simply building the dungeon and populating it with monsters. Special procedures breathed life into these worlds by introducing extra coding that enhanced the gamer's experience without changing the underlying structure or function of the code-base. If you ever played a MUD and were walking around in a dungeon and randomly saw the text \"You feel as though you are being watched.\", that was probably a special procedure. \n\nWhen developers and players were talking about these special procedures they abbreviated the term to \"proc\". Over time the noun also became a verb, \"proc'ed\" which meant that the special procedure was invoked and performed its action. Most often, players were concerned about their weapons and whether or not the weapon would perform its special attack (a proc) and so proc must have started to take on a narrower meaning for MMORPG players who were somewhat more removed from the core combat engine and flat world of MUDs.","date":"2007-04-30T08:01:37-05:00","rating":57,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"You proc'd an upvote my dude.","creationdate":"2021-04-21T22:52:39-05:00","id":1483674,"rating":0,"commentid":2631953,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"Coldboi","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"misterpwn","importedSubject":"proc"},{"commentv2":1,"number":19,"id":2631965,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I am a level 53 druid balance spec, collecting the elementals deck for when im big enough hehe.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Humanoids and Undead.<br /><br />I have acquired cards in drops from mini-bosses, the Orcs of UBRS, the Undead of the Plaguelands, even bosses in Scholomance. They are all over the game but commonly drop on higher level silver and gold ranked Humanoids and Undead.<br /><br />In addition, they are usually reasonably cheap on the Auction House (2-15+ gold) except for the Ace which, of course, is the rarest and most valuable (20-100+ gold). Remember that the prices will vary depending on server and idiocy levels.<br /><br />An easy search here in Thottbot.com is to enter the deck name of the card you need such as Beasts, Elementals, Portals, or Warlords. All of the available cards come up and can be clicked on to show which mobs drop them and an estimation of the drop rate.<br /><br />Once you have collected: Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, and Eight of any of the decks you simply put all of them in your inventory and right click on any card. The cards will create a deck. Then you simply take the deck to the Deck Vendor at the Darkmoon Faire when it is around to earn your trinket.<br /><br />Finally, if you have any of these cards and wish to trade/sell, contact me on the Blackhand server.<br /><br />- Yezmina<br />60th Sword Rogue (EleLW/GnomEngi)<br />Guild Mistress of Ill Gotten Gains<br />Blackhand</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Proc is short for &quot;spec_proc&quot; which is a term used by the original programmer of Circle-MUD, Jeremy Elson. It might have been used as well by the original programmers of diku-MUD. spec_proc is short for &quot;special procedure&quot;. Special procedures in Circle-MUD are functions that can be assigned to objects, players, and locations in the world such that each time an event occurs, the special procedure function will be invoked. Special procedures were used in Circle-MUD for a wide variety of purposes: Creating room events when a person typed a specific string of text, causing a weapon or piece of armor to perform a magical action, and even causing a MOB (mobile) to do something that it wouldn't normally do. <br /><br />Special procedures were a way of creating unique experiences that could not be achieved by simply building the dungeon and populating it with monsters. Special procedures breathed life into these worlds by introducing extra coding that enhanced the gamer's experience without changing the underlying structure or function of the code-base. If you ever played a MUD and were walking around in a dungeon and randomly saw the text &quot;You feel as though you are being watched.&quot;, that was probably a special procedure. <br /><br />When developers and players were talking about these special procedures they abbreviated the term to &quot;proc&quot;. Over time the noun also became a verb, &quot;proc'ed&quot; which meant that the special procedure was invoked and performed its action. Most often, players were concerned about their weapons and whether or not the weapon would perform its special attack (a proc) and so proc must have started to take on a narrower meaning for MMORPG players who were somewhat more removed from the core combat engine and flat world of MUDs.</div>
