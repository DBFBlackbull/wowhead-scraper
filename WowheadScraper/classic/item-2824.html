When I first looted this epic off an Ogre in the badlands I visited this page to decide weather or not to sell or use it (52 hunter at the time). I read every comment made here and more from other sources and decided \"what the hell\" Ill use it.\n\nThe first 20 minutes I used this bow I was not very impressed but warmed up to it ounce I understood what its strengths were. As you all know it shoots extremely fast which makes it quite unique. The down side is that the damage is half of comparible weapons of the same lvl so Aim, and Multi shot suffer. \n\nNow you might think that this means the weapon is weaker but that would be a faulty assumption. It acctually seems to drop mobs faster more consistently than harder hitting weapons. I find I used less mana with this bow than with my other weapons (guttbuster and dwarven hand cannon) and pull much less agro. I am still very effective in instances and draw less attention from mobs\/healers.\n\nWhen it comes to PvP this bow is also pretty good. It makes casters hit the ground faster than they can screem \"warriors help meeeee!\". Works well with other classes but again, its goona hit lighter with the special so if your a burst and run guy, you wont do as much damage as quick. If you can get range and can open up you will do massive damage. Another bonus is how quiet the bow is (unlike my guns). I found this gave me a great advantage over my old boomstick since it drew almost no attention to the poor bastard on the recieving end of it. So although I seemed to not be able to hit other players quite as hard in short bursts, I was hitting them more and lots of times without them knowing where it was coming from.\n\nIn my honest oppinion the Hurricane is an excellent weapon but defenetly has a different play style required to use it effectivly. In the right hands this bow is deadly.\n\nI will never get rid of this bow and will continue to use it in the right circumstances (between dwarven cannon and hurricane).\n\nHunters, dont be afraid to equipt this weapon if you get it. It really is a great bow.","date":"2005-10-18T21:38:19-05:00","rating":45,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"mightyred","importedSubject":"Owners Comments  - Unbias"},{"commentv2":1,"number":6,"id":2649340,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"This bow is all about [i]steady stream dps.[\/i]&nbsp; Not super burst damage.&nbsp; No OMFGWTFPWNT hits on an enemy.&nbsp; Not even really for PVP, imho. \n\nHurricane assures that you can deliver a solid flow of uninterrupted damage to your enemy.\n\nIf used right...\n\nYou won't steal aggro from the tank.\nYou will consistently outdamage mages because of the non existent downtime.\nYou will spend a ton of dough on ammo.\nYou should scope it.\nYou should ge some sort of extra agi enchant.\nYou won't haver ubar aimed shot crits.\n\nIf used in the hands of a proper hunter, you won't be upset.\n\n...\n\nUnless you're getting shot with it.\nOr can't afford ammo.","date":"2005-12-30T21:38:19-06:00","rating":12,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Geniustwin","importedSubject":"Steady Stream"},{"commentv2":1,"number":7,"id":2649354,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I am a 60 hunter in full beast stalker and I absolutely love this bow when I am running instances.&nbsp; It is however, not my primary bow, that title belongs to the Carapace Spine Crossbow. I am 5\/31\/15 spec and I make full use of both weapons (the 5 are in improved aspect of the hawk). \n\nHere is why I switch out between the two on a consistent basis.\n\n1.) The CSX has tremendous burst damage (for me 1800-2500 aimshot crit depending on the mob) and I use it to get an aimed->auto->multi shot combo in on mobs before they go down, which is about as soon as I get my shots off.\n\n2.) Instance Bosses.&nbsp; Here is where I slap on the Hurricane, and you better believe I am excited for this part.&nbsp; The tank goes in starts pissing of the boss, I start shooting and usually within 5 seconds IAoH procs, if not oh well, and I hit rapid fire.&nbsp; My ranged attack speed drops to about .7 seconds, I get in so many shots aspect of the hawk often procs 5 times through the rapid fire, meanwhile I am criting left and right and not drawing agro.&nbsp; The Hurricane dominates instance bosses.\n\nIn short both the CSX and the Hurricane are insanely damaging weapons, if you use them correctly. As a serious hunter you should get both weapons in order to take advantage of the abilities blizzard gave you.\n\n...

Sure, you can aimed shot a lot higher with other bows and multishot too - but there's more then just that to calculate with damage. Aimed shot takes 3 seconds, and multishot takes an additional bit of time after that. If you're lucky and you crit both you've done 4k-5k damage with a slower bow.

Fortunately, this means that some of the odd side effects of the old Aimed Shot are no longer relevant, such as requiring hunters to use extremely slow weapons to maximize their DPS (weapons slow enough to be able to use Aimed Shot in between auto shots) \nArcane Shot now does substantially more damage than it did before, and scales with AP. \nSteady Shot has been introduced as a core ability in the expansion, and provides much the same kind of gameplay as Aimed Shot did in the past (a shot you weave in between your normal shots), but to a much more managable degree (since it's a 1.5 sec shot, it doesn't require as slow of a weapon to take advantage of, and doesn't require to stand still for as long). \n\n[\/quote]\nA guildmate got hers for 100g before I bought mine :D\nWe play Maelstrom and I've yet to see it on AH for under 125g\n\n[i][small]Edited, Oct 12th  2006 at 10:11am PDT by Randomizzer[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-10-12T14:03:42-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Randomizzer","importedSubject":"I likes it"},{"commentv2":1,"number":71,"id":3015308,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Im getting it on my alt.","date":"2007-03-09T05:34:36-06:00","rating":-4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Fromtheshadow","importedSubject":"sfs"},{"commentv2":1,"number":72,"id":3015310,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Got this off a Jadefire Betrayer today in Felwood.","date":"2005-02-24T00:33:58-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"HunterCyprus","importedSubject":"got it too"},{"commentv2":1,"number":73,"id":3015311,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Dropped off a Living Blaze last night(5\/15\/05) in Ungoro.

Last week i had 100g and saw one up for 150g bid 200buy. So started making money like mad, but couldn't get 50 before it sold. Kept at it, made 240g, and the night before last, saw one up for 170g bid, 190 buy. Like an idiot, i hit the bid button instead of buy, and since this left me with 70g in the bank, i couldn't buyout until someone outbid me. so the spent the next day in fear of being bought out by someone :S\n\nbut no one else bid!\n\nso now i have my hurricane, for 170g, the only epic weapon i've ever wanted :) had the mats for a sniper scope so immediately got one off a guildie. now with my quiver speed and the sniper scope, it does 41 base dps, not counting attack power, waay better than the Verdant Keeper's Aim i was using before.\n\nDid a Princess Run to celebrate, - 3 pallys, a priest and me - i.e. i was the main DPS.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>malogna</b></h3>Fastest bow in the game. Excellent Hunter weapon for PvE especially for Beastmastery spec...along with Marksmenship. Procs often and effectively interrupts casters. All around good choice for PvE up to level 58-60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9388</b></h3>Also, faster attack speed means you get more value out of scopes.<br />Slap on a +7 scope on this and you're good to go!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nines</b></h3>When you spec into Proc talents faster weapons will give you more of a benefit.<br /><br />Fast nice for interrupts upon casters as well. Go this a long long time ago on my hunter and i still use it for the entertainment value.<br /><br />Expensive to run due to the high ammo consumption, but if proc talents are your thing then this is the fastest you will get.<br /><br />Unfortunately the biggest caveat is that if you are 21 points into marks and have scattershot the proc from this weapon can break the scatter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1..Striker's Mark<br />2..Hurricane<br />3..Eaglehorn <br /><br />Trust me on this one fellas..especially since hurricane is usable at lvl 48 makes it uncomparable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hello peeps,<br /><br />Just wanted to add my commends about the Hurricane. When I first looted this epic off an Ogre in the badlands I visited this page to decide weather or not to sell or use it (52 hunter at the time). I read every comment made here and more from other sources and decided &quot;what the hell&quot; Ill use it.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes I used this bow I was not very impressed but warmed up to it ounce I understood what its strengths were. As you all know it shoots extremely fast which makes it quite unique. The down side is that the damage is half of comparible weapons of the same lvl so Aim, and Multi shot suffer. <br /><br />Now you might think that this means the weapon is weaker but that would be a faulty assumption. It acctually seems to drop mobs faster more consistently than harder hitting weapons. I find I used less mana with this bow than with my other weapons (guttbuster and dwarven hand cannon) and pull much less agro. I am still very effective in instances and draw less attention from mobs/healers.<br /><br />When it comes to PvP this bow is also pretty good. It makes casters hit the ground faster than they can screem &quot;warriors help meeeee!&quot;. Works well with other classes but again, its goona hit lighter with the special so if your a burst and run guy, you wont do as much damage as quick. If you can get range and can open up you will do massive damage. Another bonus is how quiet the bow is (unlike my guns). I found this gave me a great advantage over my old boomstick since it drew almost no attention to the poor bastard on the recieving end of it. So although I seemed to not be able to hit other players quite as hard in short bursts, I was hitting them more and lots of times without them knowing where it was coming from.<br /><br />In my honest oppinion the Hurricane is an excellent weapon but defenetly has a different play style required to use it effectivly. In the right hands this bow is deadly.<br /><br />I will never get rid of this bow and will continue to use it in the right circumstances (between dwarven cannon and hurricane).<br /><br />Hunters, dont be afraid to equipt this weapon if you get it. It really is a great bow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This bow is all about <i>steady stream dps.</i>&nbsp; Not super burst damage.&nbsp; No OMFGWTFPWNT hits on an enemy.&nbsp; Not even really for PVP, imho. <br /><br />Hurricane assures that you can deliver a solid flow of uninterrupted damage to your enemy.<br /><br />If used right...<br /><br />You won't steal aggro from the tank.<br />You will consistently outdamage mages because of the non existent downtime.<br />You will spend a ton of dough on ammo.<br />You should scope it.<br />You should ge some sort of extra agi enchant.<br />You won't haver ubar aimed shot crits.<br /><br />If used in the hands of a proper hunter, you won't be upset.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Unless you're getting shot with it.<br />Or can't afford ammo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a 60 hunter in full beast stalker and I absolutely love this bow when I am running instances.&nbsp; It is however, not my primary bow, that title belongs to the Carapace Spine Crossbow. I am 5/31/15 spec and I make full use of both weapons (the 5 are in improved aspect of the hawk). <br /><br />Here is why I switch out between the two on a consistent basis.<br /><br />1.) The CSX has tremendous burst damage (for me 1800-2500 aimshot crit depending on the mob) and I use it to get an aimed-&gt;auto-&gt;multi shot combo in on mobs before they go down, which is about as soon as I get my shots off.<br /><br />2.) Instance Bosses.&nbsp; Here is where I slap on the Hurricane, and you better believe I am excited for this part.&nbsp; The tank goes in starts pissing of the boss, I start shooting and usually within 5 seconds IAoH procs, if not oh well, and I hit rapid fire.&nbsp; My ranged attack speed drops to about .7 seconds, I get in so many shots aspect of the hawk often procs 5 times through the rapid fire, meanwhile I am criting left and right and not drawing agro.&nbsp; The Hurricane dominates instance bosses.<br /><br />In short both the CSX and the Hurricane are insanely damaging weapons, if you use them correctly. As a serious hunter you should get both weapons in order to take advantage of the abilities blizzard gave you.<br /><br />... Oh and I wasn't going to brag, but I ALWAYS outdamage mages using this strategy by TENS OF THOUSANDS of damage points over an instance.&nbsp; Only combat rogues do more damage than I do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this bow from a guildy when I was 46.&nbsp; He sold it to me for 100g.<br /><br />Best 100g I've ever spent.<br /><br />Of course I worked really hard to lvl to 48 quickly so I could use it.&nbsp; I hit 48, bought a sniper scope and off I went to try it out.&nbsp; My DPS went up about 50%.<br /><br />I've heard some mixed reactions on this bow.&nbsp; I think one of the keys to this thing is to have improved aspect of the hawk.&nbsp; It is pretty much guaranteed to proc during every fight and once it does it is fantastic.&nbsp; When combined with rapid fire, it is insane.&nbsp; I am BM specced and don't have aimed shot yet.&nbsp; I am sure it will be a bit sad to see lower aimed shots but everything else is great.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a note, I have broken tooth as a pet.&nbsp; With him and this bow I have been holding my own with lvl 60 casters (at 48).&nbsp; They can't do a thing that isn't instant cast.<br /><br />Also, some people complain about the amount of arrows you go through...&nbsp; When you kills things as fast as this bow lets you at 48, you make enough cash to cover it.&nbsp; I don't know how good of an end-game bow this will be, but i look forward to using it until i get something better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have had this bow since I dinged 48 and It has served me faithfully all through that time (i dont pvp so have no need of massive aggro pulling aimed shots). With nice chance to crit stuff and speed improvements I crit loads and loads and regularly come in nice positions in DMG meteres considering my armor is all blues still and I use a &quot;sucky&quot; (nice post above btw) lvl 48 bow. The fact is the slow v fast debate will probably rage on and on and its simply your choice. Im happy with my hurricane till I get My Leaf, but clearly the poster above wasnt happy with his. 100-300g is alot to fork out just to try it. But with a sniper scope if you want my opinion, this bow owns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The new DPS is 30.3 (the old DPS without taking into account the frost damage), and I believe the proc rate for the frost arrow is about 8%:<br /><br />I did some preliminary testing for proc rates and it procs between 8 to 9 % of the time (I got 8.75% for 300 auto-shots).&nbsp; Taking into account the 31-45 damage per arrow and rounding down (8%), that would average out to an additional 1.9 DPS, bringing the bow's damage to...yes, the same as it was before, 32.2.<br /><br />The nerf would come from the fact that having a scope doesn't factor in to the frost arrow damage, and thus only increase the 30.3 DPS portion and not the full 32.2.&nbsp; However, if the frost damage wasn't occuring to begin with, then this is actually a buff as the bow was really only doing 30.3 DPS.<br /><br />Post if I made any mistakes or if you experience a different proc rate.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; I'm wondering if normalization changed from calculating off the 32.2 prior to this 1.11 patch and now calculates off of 30.3.&nbsp; I'll have to watch my aimed shots to see if there is a reduction or not.&nbsp; Thoughts?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had the hurricane bow from lvl 49 to 60....well past my first tier set and into running zg and aq...when finally it dropped,&nbsp; Mandokir's Sting...I won the roll equipped and put my hurricane in the bank to rot...<br /><br />Then I changed my playstyle...respeced into mark/survival and watched my dps rise and I maintained a placement of 3-5 on overall 20 man dmg reports.<br /><br />BUT I NO LONGER HAD IMP AOH...and missed the procs...so I started researching bows again...Found the reference here to the 5/31/15 spec and decided to try it w/ the hurricane in endgame runs. <br /><br />I ended up doing 5/33/13..but the premise is the same<br /><br />Last night I ranked NUMBER 1 ON DPS out of a ZG 20 man.&nbsp; I outscored both mages and rogues (and a hunter w/ over 500 agi) after taking down 3 bosses and lots of trash.<br /><br />The idea of speed/proc really works...and the lack of aggro just means more arrows and less fd to reposition for ranging...<br /><br />YES...I still use my STING, in fact I can't live w/ out it for soloing...but for instancing...THIS BUILD and WEAPON ROCK!<br /><br />Indigomoon (Llane)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of the 2.0 patch the hurricane DPS is now 37.8, it is a much needed boost for hunters everywhere.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just thought Id throw my 2 cents in here. Im surprised there is such split opinions as to whether it pwns or not. Ill put it to you like this... <br /><br />Im lvl 55 right now, and am usually placing in the top 6-10 Alliance players in Arathi Basin. <br /><br />This bow is incredible, especially the fact you can start using it at lvl 48. Itll be a sorry day when I give it up for Marshall's B'eye<br /><br />and yes, I know Alliance suck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I only paid 75g for hurricane because they were 4 up at the same time ^^<br /><br />btw I peeked into beta stats for ranged weapons and there seem to be no really fast ones for lvl 61+ :-/<br />maybe blizz realized how strong fast bows are for BMs and nerfed it :-/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just bought it off the AH for 75G on Spirestone (Alliance) I am a 49 Hunter right now and it took my DPS off the chart and with my pet (King B) with Cobra Reflexes that is about the best combo you can get since they nerfed all pet attack speeds. Watch out casters cause I am holding your doom. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I actually just got this bow today during a Sunken Temple run. Sure, I'm already 60 but its a step up from what I have and I've yet to find anything better (partly due to my never doing end game crap). Its fast as a mother-you get the idea. I'm loving it and its my first epic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>WOOOOO got mine today. 49 Hunter. I've been making money like mad lately saving up for it. I expected to have to collect 150g, as that is the usual AH price, but tonight there were 3 on sale, one of them at 100g. So I took the 80g I had, sold a few things to a vendor (my phantom blade that I never use being one of them) and borrowed 15g from a friend. He's getting 20g back tomorrow, but he doesn't know that yet. I'm so happy ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well at least there is no comparable gun to this item. It would be horrible if gun users could put out this kind of nutty DPS at level 48.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just want to inform the &quot;only good for...&quot;, &quot;not good for...&quot; and others who would discount this weapon because it's not all things to all classes that it is possible to carry multiple bows and change between them (even in combat) as the situation dictates.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can't stress enough how good this bow actually is because of it's prot and it's damage. If you have the talent which gives you a CoH to increase speed by 40% this activates with this bow quite often. With Rapid fire on and a High Agility I've had this sucker fire a shot every .6 seconds - add crit gear to that and marksman speced talents and you are doing up to 1000 dmg per second easily with this sucker. Sure, you can aimed shot a lot higher with other bows and multishot too - but there's more then just that to calculate with damage. Aimed shot takes 3 seconds, and multishot takes an additional bit of time after that. If you're lucky and you crit both you've done 4k-5k damage with a slower bow. However, during the aimed shot period you are unable to move and if your target moves too far or too close you are screwed. Esspecially in PVP, it's important to have a quick shot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have no idea! But I could so use it right now ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've heard complaints that ammunition is expensive with this bow. I personally am not worried, but you could use the cheaper ammunition and get about the same damage with this bow as using a slower bow and better ammunition in terms of DPS.<br /><br />Aimed shot sounds wonderful one versus one, but in battlegrounds I don't have the discipline to work out a strategy with aimed shot. Usually I am trying to kill a healer or caster while a rogue or warrior beats on me. I just try to fire as much as possible and hope the tide of battle shifts in our favor (while I am rezzing usually).<br /><br />Since I have 300 engineering to make the scopes, I would prefer the Hurricaine even for PvP. Over the long haul I think my DPS will be better. I am only level 39 at the moment, but I am going to try this out when I get to 48.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Personally, I prefer fast bows in PvP as it allows me to be more mobile... Sure one on one aimed shot is nice since you can usually afford to give yourself the 3 seconds of staying still to get it off... But in BGs, things can change really fast and I find it preferable to arrow burn as much as I can until I need to get moving again... So any bow that let's me do as much damage as possible in &lt;2 seconds is going to be my favorite for PvP...<br /><br />Give me this and AB boots with speed enchant and I'll make a fool of any hunter with a slow bow :P</div>

Why does everyone think that a bow with a high speed and an average dps (compared to other epics) is good!

This talent was always intended to be an &quot;opening&quot; shot, and not something that would be woven between shots. However, since Aimed Shot became such a core element for Hunter DPS, we didn't want to make this change until we were prepared to make several other changes to increase hunter DPS to offset it. Fortunately, this means that some of the odd side effects of the old Aimed Shot are no longer relevant, such as requiring hunters to use extremely slow weapons to maximize their DPS (weapons slow enough to be able to use Aimed Shot in between auto shots) <br />Arcane Shot now does substantially more damage than it did before, and scales with AP. <br />Steady Shot has been introduced as a core ability in the expansion, and provides much the same kind of gameplay as Aimed Shot did in the past (a shot you weave in between your normal shots), but to a much more managable degree (since it's a 1.5 sec shot, it doesn't require as slow of a weapon to take advantage of, and doesn't require to stand still for as long). <br /><br /></div><br />A guildmate got hers for 100g before I bought mine :D<br />We play Maelstrom and I've yet to see it on AH for under 125g<br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 12th 2006 at 10:11am PDT by Randomizzer</i></div>

Last week i had 100g and saw one up for 150g bid 200buy. So started making money like mad, but couldn't get 50 before it sold. Kept at it, made 240g, and the night before last, saw one up for 170g bid, 190 buy. Like an idiot, i hit the bid button instead of buy, and since this left me with 70g in the bank, i couldn't buyout until someone outbid me. so the spent the next day in fear of being bought out by someone :S<br /><br />but no one else bid!<br /><br />so now i have my hurricane, for 170g, the only epic weapon i've ever wanted :) had the mats for a sniper scope so immediately got one off a guildie. now with my quiver speed and the sniper scope, it does 41 base dps, not counting attack power, waay better than the Verdant Keeper's Aim i was using before.<br /><br />Did a Princess Run to celebrate, - 3 pallys, a priest and me - i.e. i was the main DPS. When i pulled aggro from one of the giants, the 3 pallies couldn't pull it off me, only the priest's healing finally took the aggro :D<br /><br />i haven't noticed any slowing, but will certainly look out for it. personally, i doubt the frost damage will do any slowing.<br /><br />Speed vs. hit damage? You can't use a single bow all the time. i keep the VKA (2.8 attack speed) for aimed shot and some pvp - later i'll switch it for a really slow crossbow. for autoshoot and fighting casters, i use a fast weapon - i was using the megashot before, now i'll use the hurricane. other classes are used to switching weapons in the middle of combats, hunters should too. and if i got used to switching from arrows+bow to bullets+gun while fighting, just switching for one bow to another is childsplay, just one button press.<br /><br />and hurricane has small crits, but man do they come fast :D you should have seen me tearing into the princess.<br /><br />i wonder whether +frost damage items will add to the hurricane's frost damage. i doubt it, but it would be insane dps if it did.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jun 2 16:35:25 2005</div>

I usually position myself so I am hard to spot and just spam as much arrows as I can. :P<br />I don't find low damage a problem at all.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a horrible kiting/PvP weapon. Kiting depends on doing as much damage using instant attacks between snares, and oftentimes because of a chase you can't use your regular attack. <br /><br />I love it when someone tries to show off this bow to me in a duel.. I just switch out to my Bow of Searing Arrows and still destroy them.<br /><br />&quot;But this has higher DPS.. and it's like really fast!..&quot; lmao</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tested whether the Frost Arrow proc would get added damage from equipping the freezing band ring. All procs ranged from 31-45 damage, so it appears that weapon procs do not benefit from bonuses to magical effects. I could be wrong, but I fired more than a thousand arrows and never saw anything above 45. But the frost arrow does crit on its own.<br /><br />I also have a +7 scope on it. I would estimate that raises the DPS to about 35, which means it is the best bow I can get until the epic bows at level 60. In warsong gulch, when I duked it out with another hunter at my level one-on-one, I hardly even lost. Yes, it uses ammo like crazy, but it performs like no other.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just bought this from a guy for 37G with a +7 scope already on it, my friend uses it and says its great better than his green pos bow, i feel like i ripped that guy off but apparently this bow is great till hunters hit high lvls and can get Rhok'delar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mungbeansss</b></h3>This is an extremely unique weapon. I think every hunter should try to get their hands on this. Obviously your 60 (primary) ranged weapon should have a speed of 2.8 or higher. BUT this bow has incredible perks if your trying to fight against casters in pvp or any enemy that has frost vulnerability (which hunter have no spell or attack with frost damage other than with this bow).<br /><br />When i used this bow (from 48-58) i would not use aimed shot. If i were to use it in a 60 raid, i still would not used aimed shot. Just rotate multi shot and arcane shot otherwise you will clip your fast auto shots and will have garbage dps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Killerstorm</b></h3>I just got this from a <a href="/classic/npc=9044/scarshield-sentry">Scarshield Sentry</a>#drops:200+17-21+1 .</div>
