I want it, and i'll explain why. \n\nIn MC, the paladin's job is indeed to heal and cleanse. Some of the bosses, you'll only heal (Garr for example), some you'll mostly cleanse, but most of the bosses, you'll do both. As far as I know, and I know up to Domo, there's always something a pally can cleanse in a boss might in MC, and even with mobs. Sometimes it's not very usefull, as with Garr where the only debuff you'll have slows people down, but sometimes you just can't beat the boss without it (sulfuron, and I could add Domo when mages throw polymorph on themselves when the shield is up :P)\n\nThat said, i'm a pally with now 7k+ mana in raids and what I was trying to get lately is +healing. I didn't think it was important and it's the only reason why a paladin should not get +healing items before lvl 60 (as this trinket that I don't have). Let's see... the normal flash of light says to be max +435. If you add +300 healing to it, with the effect of blessing of light (which you'll have in MC, of course) and considering that the spell is a crit, you can easily reach up to 1100 healing. That's what I call worthy of 140 mana. On none-crit flash of lights, I usually get around 650-700. \n\nWhat I get out of this is that the pally's heal should be efficient (+healing) and as long as possible (mana pool). With 7k+ mana and now 320 +healing, I usually don't run out of mana for boss fights (all but domo, in fact) and my heals are not so crappy. As for the fire resistance, it's of course important in MC (and BWL). However, I do not have that much yet, I get around 100 with my aura on. We have not tried Rag yet, thought. What I don't know is if it's good or not to drop mana pool and\/or +healing for Rag fight. \n\nPhew, that's a bit long ^^, just a opinion, eh :)","date":"2006-09-07T06:37:17-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Boosterfire","importedSubject":"Paladin's job in MC."},{"commentv2":1,"number":19,"id":2661880,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"It is very amazing to me to constantly hear about people that have either no idea what a Paladin is really supposed to do or they talk about end-game instances they have never been in.\n\nI am a regular in end-game instances and am still learning something on every run.

In fights that are specifically FR required fights, I swap for my FR gear; for the rest, I wear my +heal and +mana. A Pally is PRIMARILY needed for their aura\/buffs\/heals in any end-game instance. If they happen to do a little DPS (I can do around 100 DPS), thats real nice, but it wont make a big difference to a mob with 50,000+ health.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am very amused by all the people complaining that this trinket sucks.&nbsp; I especially laugh at the people complaining about the similar trinket for shamen that adds +15 heal AND damage to spells and effects.&nbsp; +15 not sound like much?&nbsp; Read again: spells AND EFFECTS.&nbsp; So for a shaman that adds damage to totems and all that.&nbsp; If a Pally got it, that would add to retribution aura, seal of righteousness, etc.&nbsp; +20 healing only is not as great, but it will work with Seal of Light which is pretty nice.<br /><br />And as far as the person who made the argument that +10 fire res sucks because +60 only gives you poor?&nbsp; Loser.&nbsp; It's all about building up a set with good res.&nbsp; If you put together a suit of the dark iron plate plus this trinket, you can get around 200 resistance, and at that level 10 does make a difference.&nbsp; SO you go on saying +10 sucks, while I am using Onyxia's breath as a hair dryer.</div>

Don't go down, simply jump up onto the left side rail of the stairs (go at it with an angle, and be careful not to aggro the ogres below you).<br /><br />Look down to your left and you'll see a rail like the one you are standing on that wraps around (cont)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>That fire resist is a must for post patch ragnoros and onyxia there damage now is insane. So if you have only been up to domo and not Rag himself or the sons then no you dont need this. But once at rag this is a must. And if you are smart your devo gives you +918 armor. Thats just my opinion tho.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does the +heal effect stack with Judgement of Light and Crusader enchant?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest can be done at 54 with the assistance from a person with the cresent key. I just baught the book on Spinebreaker and did it with a friend. You really dont need more then a Lesser Invisibility potion (But you can use a Invisibility potion if you would like to be safer). Since its such a short distance from the start of the instance past the first mob you only need one potion. <br /><br />The thing you need to look out for is the Dog Patrol, they spot you very easy because of there high stealth detection, I had to die once to learn to watch closer. <br /><br />When you go down the ramp to the left at the very beginning of the instance, try not to get to close to the mob at the bottom, jump off the side to get a little distance and then hug the corner of the next ramp down to the library door. Once you get into the library door you're in the clear. Enjoy you new Trinket when you finish that long run down the hall!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What have you been smoking? If you check the healing done score in MC, paladins are constantly up there with priest and druids.<br /><br />As a druid speaking, I would like the priest one too. mana/5 seconds items are nicer stats in my book. (rank 4 healing touch+mana/5second+400 bonus to healing = godly.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is not very surprising that priest is chosen as the main healer, since they have the highest &quot;burst healing&quot; of all three healing classes on alliance side, but unless the gear difference is too much, even a discipline priest will definitely lose to a healdin or resto druid in endurance. Healdin is just as fast as priest but their heal is relatively weak compare to priest while a druid can deliever similar or greater amount of healing, their heal is way too slow.<br /><br />Here is how the three healing class typically coordinate.<br /><br />Paladins will spam heals to keep the tank's health up in a non-ending stream, druid will keep cast the larger heal, cancel if the tank's health is almost full and priest keep the tank alive with flash heal in case of sudden damage spike.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>DM is a great instance for healadins who are gearing up for MC, since there are tonnes of +healing items that drop, the fantastic gloves that drop from the final boss in north are a good example<br /><br />this is also a pretty good trinket as well, though i don't think its worth the extortionist amounts you see it on the AH for, considering it can be farmed in east (it has a 1/3 drop chance from the final boss of east) in a party of 3 or 4 people in about 20 minutes</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can this door open by blacksmithing key?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>+10 FR? Thats already been explained above. People on my server have been saying &quot;+22 healing? Thats nothing, just stupid and pathetic excuse for a buff.&quot; Ok, for all the noobs out there, heres a tip. Paladins heal with FLASH if Light. I just got this trinket at 54. Im using Spiderfang Carapace and Earthslag shoulders. Now yes, on a massive heal with Divine favor, +22 is nothing, but if your a good healer, that rarely happens. With all of those together (gear), I have ~+50 healing. I bless light when im healing, typically. Thats another +90. so +110 on a Flash of light. Adding that, with a steady stream of healing, 10 seconds later, i just got +770 healing FREE. Learn to heal nooblets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a paladin in a guild that now goes to mc on a regular basis and I don't have this trinket. I want it, and i'll explain why. <br /><br />In MC, the paladin's job is indeed to heal and cleanse. Some of the bosses, you'll only heal (Garr for example), some you'll mostly cleanse, but most of the bosses, you'll do both. As far as I know, and I know up to Domo, there's always something a pally can cleanse in a boss might in MC, and even with mobs. Sometimes it's not very usefull, as with Garr where the only debuff you'll have slows people down, but sometimes you just can't beat the boss without it (sulfuron, and I could add Domo when mages throw polymorph on themselves when the shield is up :P)<br /><br />That said, i'm a pally with now 7k+ mana in raids and what I was trying to get lately is +healing. I didn't think it was important and it's the only reason why a paladin should not get +healing items before lvl 60 (as this trinket that I don't have). Let's see... the normal flash of light says to be max +435. If you add +300 healing to it, with the effect of blessing of light (which you'll have in MC, of course) and considering that the spell is a crit, you can easily reach up to 1100 healing. That's what I call worthy of 140 mana. On none-crit flash of lights, I usually get around 650-700. <br /><br />What I get out of this is that the pally's heal should be efficient (+healing) and as long as possible (mana pool). With 7k+ mana and now 320 +healing, I usually don't run out of mana for boss fights (all but domo, in fact) and my heals are not so crappy. As for the fire resistance, it's of course important in MC (and BWL). However, I do not have that much yet, I get around 100 with my aura on. We have not tried Rag yet, thought. What I don't know is if it's good or not to drop mana pool and/or +healing for Rag fight. <br /><br />Phew, that's a bit long ^^, just a opinion, eh :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is very amazing to me to constantly hear about people that have either no idea what a Paladin is really supposed to do or they talk about end-game instances they have never been in.<br /><br />I am a regular in end-game instances and am still learning something on every run. I currently have +257 to my healing spells and +23 mana/5 sec with my current gear. I can boost my FR, but have to trade off for some healing and mana. In fights that are specifically FR required fights, I swap for my FR gear; for the rest, I wear my +heal and +mana. A Pally is PRIMARILY needed for their aura/buffs/heals in any end-game instance. If they happen to do a little DPS (I can do around 100 DPS), thats real nice, but it wont make a big difference to a mob with 50,000+ health. The only reason I actually hit an end-game boss is to recover my mana from a judgement of the seal of wisdom, and I usually am around the top 5 for a raid in healing. I sometimes go down to around 10th when another pally isnt pulling their weight with cleansing.<br /><br />The worste possible thing that a Pally can do is to have full mana as a boss dies! I will not raid with Pallies that dont heal/cleanse/buff!</div>
