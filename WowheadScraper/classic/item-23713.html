<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8188</b></h3>If you happen to end up with one of these, you can redeem them in Booty Bay. Look for a guy with two bodyguards, one riding a turtle, to talk to.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Poker</b></h3>This drops from the WoW Trading Card Game Cards, it was released on October 29th, and the card it comes from is called: Thunderhead Hippogryph<br /><br />After receiving your card (which is from the booster packs or if you're willing to dig into your pockets costs about $22), go onto WorldofWarcraft.com and you can use the code to activate the code, and then head onto your character and into Booty Bay where Landro Longshot on the docks will give you one in exchange for the code.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8271</b></h3>I never heard of this or seen this ever. And my server is a very OLD server which is hard to believe there isnt any of these on my serv. But who knows the horde might have them. But if Poker is right then im gonna get me one of those codes i think its defintly worth it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6859</b></h3>I got a pack of the WoW TCG cards yesterday, and a winning scratch off with one of these was in there.<br /><br />It's cute, and it's certainly unique, but it's not terribly exciting. If you have this and you're standing around in a major city, be prepared to get a lot of whispers asking where people can get it from.<br /><br />Also, if you get a scratch off card, you can redeem it from <a href="http://www.ude.com/loot" rel="nofollow">http://www.ude.com/loot</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>13943</b></h3>Well... Considering another TCG, Magic the Gathering, in which you just collect cards and don't get any bonus after buying alot of 'em and playing for ages, getting a little pet or a mount, that might do anything, but just be there, is awesome imo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>14405</b></h3>Chased this card for a while, ended up buying at least 10-12 booster packets. Ended up swapping all my cards for this card. Worthwhile having. Haven't seen another one on my server. Probably cheaper to buy card from ebay then try to get lucky buying packets of cards.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>26683</b></h3>Hippogryph hatchling, is probably the rarest small pet in the game, it can only be obtained by finding the &quot;Coded&quot; Thunderhead hippogryph card in the TCG decks (not to be confused with the same uncoded card).<br />This is a very rare card and your chances of finding this card by buying random booster packs are not good, a better way is to find a card seller on e:bay expect to pay in excess of £25 though.<br />Also expect to be hassled by players everytime you get it out asking where you got it.<br />If you want to see one in game and are on shadowsong server just contact Kulgar of the Aztec knights.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This isnt a drop or quest or even a vendor item...<br /><br />this is a reward code off of a rare card from the new WOW trading card game from Upper Deck. You get a rare version of a card with a loto-style scratch off section with a code. You then go to what ever NPC they will impliment and give him/her the code, much like the Blizzcon Murky pet.<br /><br />So if you want it, either check ebay and good luck finding one cheap (there is a turle mount card up for like $200+ at the lowest), or start buying some packs of cards and hope you get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is one of the items available as a reward to players of the <i>World of Warcraft</i> CCG/TCG (Collectable/Tradable Card Game).<br /><br />The cards that give you an item are:<br />1) <i>Landro Longshot</i>: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23705">Item: Tabard of Flame</a><br />2) <i>Thunderhead Hippogryph</i>: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23713">Item: Hippogryph Hatchling</a> (non-combat pet)<br />3) <i>Saltwater Snapjaw</i>: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23720">Item: Riding Turtle</a> (moves at your walking speed)<br /><br />To get the item, you need a copy of the card that no one has used yet. There is a scratch of area (like an instant lottery game), under this scratch off area is a code unique to that copy of that card, so each card's code can only be used once ever.<br /><br />There are three more items that are only available with &quot;UDE Points&quot;. Each booster pack comes with a code that can be used online to register 100 UDE points. Get enough points and you can spend them on UDE/WoW Items. The in-game items that will be available are:<br />1) An alternate blue tabard<br />2) A reusable trinket that sets off a unique fireworks display<br />3) A reusable trinket that changes your in-game appearance to an ogre<br /><br />Last, but not least, each of these items is specific to the single character you claim it for, not your whole account.<br /><br />More details at <a href="http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/news/article.aspx?aid=1243" rel="nofollow">Loot Cards and UDE Points FAQ</a></div>
