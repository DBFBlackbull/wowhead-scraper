Drops off one mob, around 2% chance of drop at best and combine that with&nbsp; the likely possibility of 2-3 people rolling on it, you may never actually get the carapace. So NEVER get your hopes up about owning this without getting the carapace first. If you are a warrior without the quest, and someone tells you you shouldn't roll - ignore them. The quest is easy to get and the carapace is only needed for 2 items in the game. The carapace drops off Gyth - Rend's mount - in UBRS.\n\n---------------------\n10x Brilliant Chromatic Scales\n---------------------\n\nThe easiest reagent - they aren't soulbound, so can be bought from AH (15g each on my server). They also drop 1-2 times a run in UBRS from the same fight with Gyth\/Rend.\n\n---------------------\n10x Blood of Heroes\n---------------------\n\nContrary to what people say, this is the second easiest item. Simply google \"blood of heroes map\" and then scout round Western Plaguelands and Eastern Plaguelands at the locations marked.

This item is a lootable drop. When I received mine we did not even have a skinner amongst us.<br /><br />This item is only needed by those who wear plate or mail. It is by far the hardest item to get in the long process of making the Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight (for plate wearers) or Legplates of the Chromatic Defier (for mail wearers).<br /><br />Upon receiving this item it only took me a matter of 6 hours to collect the entire list.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maim</b></h3>Don't even bother collecting the other materials until you have gained your own Chromatic Carapace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>598</b></h3>such a low drop rate on this item, People must be getting it confused with the item needed for the cloth/leather wearers quest like this that requires the pristine hide of the beast. the hide is only obtained through skinning the carapace is a random drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7968</b></h3>It's worth your trouble though. The breastplate is an awesome epic for starting out raiders. Since you will have to pass through UBRS many a time to get your attunements I'd say you have a decent chance of getting it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>14583</b></h3>How the mighty have fallen.<br /><br />This item used to be considered one of the very best pieces of loot in the game, aboslutely tops if you were not involved in raiding.<br /><br />Now I wonder if it will ever be obtained by anyone again as the instance that drops it has been relegated to a cumbersome annoyance to either help lowbies finish quests or to get Blackwing Lair / Onyxia attunments completed.<br /><br />The Breastplate crafted from it will forever have a special place in my bank.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This drops off Gyth, Rend's mount, in UBRS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just got mine in a pickup group of all things.&nbsp; Won it with a 42, no less, against three others.<br /><br />I'm a little dazed right now :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Saw this once while raiding with the MT of the guild I joined the day after the raid.<br />It dropped, and I had no idea what it was for, even tho I had the quest. Luckily he was working on the quest and was the only one to roll on the item and won it obviously. ;)<br />When he recived the item, the other warrior in the group went completely berzerk, later we found out he had the ML on his ignorelist. Then he can learn it. ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been to UBRS countless times since I was lvl 58. It dropped once last week, and I lost the roll on it. I rolled a 27ish, and a hunter rolled a 99. Been waiting for this piece for months now. I have every other mat for the chestpiece.. Guess I'm going to have to wait longer, unless they upped the drop rate with the 1.10 patch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I must say, the drop rate on this item has increased greatly. It dropped for a second time today on my third UBRS run in two days. Sadly each time my warrior was not present...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had never seen this drop before but since the last patch everytime I go to UBRS and someone says they have the quest and need it, it drops, droped like 3 times in about 7 of my runs, Warrior got it everytime.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've done 60+ UBRS runs and i never saw it once, even felstriker the epic dagger from rend has droped...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After a month of UBRS runs and almost giving up it suddenly dropped. <br /><br />People stood around dumbly wondering what it was for. I dont think anyone has begged so loud and pitfully as me.<br /><br />Got it though, now to get those BOHs.<br /><br />The fact there was no palis or other tanks in the group certainly helped my cause.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got it today :D When I saw group leader posted it in chat I allmost had a heart attack, the other warrior rolled 7, I rolled a 76. No other in group needed it :D Hooraay for me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have never even seen this item so as to lose by rolling. I either have seriously bad luck...or.....seriously bad luck. Anyone have any rough ideas on the drop rate, because I am tired of waiting for my &quot;1337 Purplez&quot; this quest has dragged on for so long and I have been to UBRS so many times its killing me. Any help would be appreciated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i don't know if this is true but i have heard if the person in the group who has the key uses it at rend(which sumons a dragon to fight with you/ this part i know for sure) then i have been told that is what makes it drop/or increases the drop rate, sadly most i have seen in the UBRS groups (save one time/and it droped) i have been in fail to know that the ring/which is the key does this or pays someone to open the door. I have said it before we have gotten to him USE YOUR KEY! and dureing the fight USE YOUR KEY! after he flys out. and still they do not....you think after the trouble it takes to get the key they would use it everytime even if for only the reason that duh...he helps you fight him. so now i already have all the items for my breastplate and only seeing the carapace drop once(was nija'd no suprise) im gonna first try to finish my key so all those none english speakers useing macro's and nubs who don't listen on US servers can't get in the way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>after close to 100 UBRS runs, both this and felstriker dropped. now what are the chances of that<br /><br />got the carapace of course<br /><br />lvl 60 warrior</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>any idea if they increased the drop rate on this cause i saw it like twice in two back to back urbs runs. its also bop now if that means anything... <br /><br />60war</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest has pissed me off so much you will not believe. It says it has a .8 percent chance of dropping right? To date i have done 418 UBRS runs for it and it has not dropped once.Thats right, 418. Now statistically, that would mean that it would have to have dropped at the very least 3 times. But no, Blizz decides to have some fun with me and not let it drop despite the hundreds of runs, hours of effort and so on. And i want it soo bad too, since ive gotten all my Blood of Heroes, Brilliant Chromatic Scales, and Abomination Stitchings. <br /><br />Sigh...guess i better keep tryin and hopin that Blizz pulls their heads outta their asses and lets it drop like its supposed to.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Valyan, i got a little angry when I saw your post but I suppose everyone has their opinion.<br /><br />0.8% does not mean it will drop exactly 8 times out of 1000,&nbsp; it means Every Gyth Kill has 0.8% chance of dropping it<br /><br />That means, you can do UBRS 1 Billion times, with 0 carapace drops. <br /><br />I'm sure Blizzard have better things to do then playing with your mind,&nbsp; they have lagging servers that needs to be fixed you know!<br /><br />Why on earth would someone run UBRS that many times?&nbsp; 30 times, maybe, 60 times,, perhaps.&nbsp; But 418?&nbsp; You have more chance of getting a Epic item by joining a guild that do higher lvl instances then Farming UBRS for epics.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I missed something, let me know. <br /><br />peace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did a lot of runs in ubrs, don't now how many, and not all of them was for this item, first was the swords set,attunement,etc, and now, well into my 60's and with a lot better cheast piece than these, im still searching for the drop, but never been able to see one.I think u ppl should get over with the ideea that the Burning Crusade is near, and this chest piece will get obsolete, as many&nbsp; of our 60 level things we have will be also:)))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where exactly i can find it ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Firstly, this is a quest that begins from a nearly dead dragon in UBRS.<br /><br />It's also possibly the most mind-numbingly difficult quest in Warcraft for a non-legendary item.<br /><br />When you get down to the nitty gritty, you're told you need 4 reagents.<br /><br />---------------------<br />1x Chromatic Carapace<br />---------------------<br /><br />This is easily the hardest item to get. Drops off one mob, around 2% chance of drop at best and combine that with&nbsp; the likely possibility of 2-3 people rolling on it, you may never actually get the carapace. So NEVER get your hopes up about owning this without getting the carapace first. If you are a warrior without the quest, and someone tells you you shouldn't roll - ignore them. The quest is easy to get and the carapace is only needed for 2 items in the game. The carapace drops off Gyth - Rend's mount - in UBRS.<br /><br />---------------------<br />10x Brilliant Chromatic Scales<br />---------------------<br /><br />The easiest reagent - they aren't soulbound, so can be bought from AH (15g each on my server). They also drop 1-2 times a run in UBRS from the same fight with Gyth/Rend.<br /><br />---------------------<br />10x Blood of Heroes<br />---------------------<br /><br />Contrary to what people say, this is the second easiest item. Simply google &quot;blood of heroes map&quot; and then scout round Western Plaguelands and Eastern Plaguelands at the locations marked. When you see a small pool of red blood, take off all your armour, loot it - and die. It's just easier to die - I got all 10 in 5 hours.<br /><br />---------------------<br />10x Frayed Abomination Stitchings<br />---------------------<br /><br />These are a nightmare and you;ll be sick of Stratholme Undead after a while. 1-3 drop a run in the Slaughterhouse off the Abominations. I'd advise&nbsp; you to guild run Strat rather than PuG because its very frustrating being ninja'd or going through the entire instance and several group members quitting before the Baron.<br /><br />Once you have all this, you'll be pleased to know there isn't a charge to have this bp made. Simply go to the nelf in Andorhal and hand the quest in.<br /><br />After saying all that, this really isn't worth the effort with The Burning Crusade coming out :P<br /><br />Tubey<br />Lvl 60 Human Warrior<br />Khadgar (Home of the Ghost Lords)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well this dropped today and a frigging Pally won it even though he didn't have the quest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dropped today for me and a pally rolled a 93, i (60 hunter) prayed to God and i rolled a 94...woot @ me!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I certainly think they did boost the drop rate. Our first UBRS run after 1.10 we get the Pristine Hide -- second run, this drops for one of our warriors. He and I are rocking nice chestpieces now. Good luck, y'all, think Blizzard decided to loosen up a bit!<br /><br />Now if I can just get a dang felstriker ...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been to UBRS many times with much more experienced players who know what's what and have no problem with me (a warrior) rolling need on this stuff, but in a noob PUG...<br /><br />First a Brilliant Chromatic Scale dropped, I was in a noob PUG and don't think hardly anyone knew what it was for, I rolled Need after everyone rolled Greed, I said &quot;it's for a quest.&quot; And someone's like &quot;hey man that's rude, if ya woulda rolled Need right away it woulda been ok&quot;. So now everyone thinks I might be a ninja. I have the quest, and was hesitant to roll need in a PUG for the very fact that they didn't know wtf it's for. I thought &quot;Christ hope the Carapace doesn't drop and I won't have to explain this ^&amp;*! to them&quot;...it drops.<br /><br />I immediately roll Need so they don't think I'm a ninja, bad idea on something epic that no one knows wtf it's for. &quot;wtf dude&quot; says the raid leader, than I spent the next 2 min. trying explain it's for a quest, I linked the quest, and linked the reward you get, I couldn't remember who else could roll on it so I just said &quot;roll Need only if ya have the quest&quot;. &quot;Look it up on thottbot or something if ya don't believe me.&quot; I guess some people got the point but 2 dumbasses rolled Need, think one of them was a druid &gt;_&lt;, luckily I won with an 88. =)<br /><br />Moral of the story..make sure everyone knows what it's for before it drops.<br /><br />When I got back to IF I checked AH for more scales and thought well let's see if by some miracle Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying is up for sale..it was.. for 850g b/o! OMFG thank you! Onxyia here I come. :D<br /><br />Chromatic Carapace and Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying in the same night. Merry Christmas to me. =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>frankly this is the toughest ingredient in the armor to get, so if ya ask me dont bother w/ the quest unless you get the carapace</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>oh my god. tonight went on a run to drakk to finish my onyxia key quest and got to rend. we kill gyth and this drops. the raid almost wipes cuz the 2 (one was me) wars pretty much stopped moving after we saw it. we finish up and i roll need, the other war waits and says this is mine. my heart was honestly bouncing out my chest, i close my eyes open and see the you have received chromatic carapce message and i about died. i thought it was a myth that this thing exsisted. it is just a normal drop of gyth no skinning required.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hmmmmm Blizzard sometimes u shock me.<br />I have ran UBRS over 40 times. To start, I recieved my BP of valor before my shoulder of valor not that i even wear them lol. Just wanted the set I guess.<br />I was amazed on Sunday, typical PUG UBRS and shocked when that chromatic carapace dropped I was like ZOMG, Thank god everyone in the raid knew what it was and who it was for. Just me and another warrior no Shammy's. I rolled an 85 against a 5 sry but i'm glad I got it been there so many times and got !@#$. I dont even have the damn Draconian deflector lol. It has only dropped with my BP of valor and I could't need both, should have needed the shield instead of the BP oh well. I think this BP chest is awesome probably the best in the game so far for fire resistance it actually has good stats also.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok here is how it goes.. in UBRS with my friends.. we are 5 man in UBRS :P rock on ... and well we are going super fast through it.. get to Rend and Gyth.. didnt kill all the adds that walk in fast enough, so in Gyth walks/ flys (whatever) we manage to kill him just before the adds kills us.. i loot, Carapace Drops.. 60 warrior .. EXTREMELY pleased rolls need.. 1 very happy guild run ... but the 58 rogue needs to kill Rend .. so we run back.. <br /> get back to Rend/ Gyth.. same happens we dont kill adds fast enough.. kill Gyth loot him.. DA DA another carapace .. insane really.. warrior took it again because none of the other members needed (60 druid, 60 rogue, 60 warlock, 60 warrior, 58 rogue).. so for all you that wipe in UBRS with 10 men.. shame on you .. SHAME ON YOU :) take care all .. happy grinding for this item</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This just dropped for me some hours ago (lv 60 tauren warrior). I had no hope about that drop, just focused on Drakki for my Valor chest, but ML linked it to raid. First we ppl didnt believe, we told him to stop joking but he seriorusly wanted rolls for needers. I closed my eyes, prayed to God and rolled... There was a great silence for a moment, then ppl start to congratulate me... I rolled 99, and nobody else rolled after seeing my roll. Believe God guys, and dont stop praying... <br /><br />PS:I also won a magister binding, a fire deflector trinket schematic, a +20 FR cape and a book of prayer of fortitude II in that raid, but whiped 2 times at Drakki because of some noobish mistakes :)<br /><br />Edited, Tue May 2 22:50:00 2006</div>
