With axe spec, you have a 5% higher chance to do ~100 damage instead of 45. With sword spec, you have a 5% chance to basically get a free swing for just 10 rage. \n\nAm I saying that warriors shouldn't use this weapon? Of course not. But if you look at all the variables, from a PvP standpoint this might not be the absolute best weapon for a warrior.\"\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nYou're looking at only one side of the argument. Another side is as thus:\n\n5% more crit instead of 5% chance to get an extra attack = 5% more chance to crit SPELLS. A Mortal Strike crit, for example, will do more damage than a Mortal Strike hit and an addition normal hit from Sword Spec. This is firstly due to the fact that Mortal Strike hits for more than a normal hit, and thus 2x this hit is more than a single MS hit and normal hit. Secondly, +5% crit is friendly for all Warriors with the \"Impale\" talent which adds an additional +20% damage on Spell Criticals. The same goes for Whirlwind, Heroic Strike, Cleave, and so on. In the end, IMO, Axe Spec = Sword Spec in terms of how good it is - it's just different.\n\nOne advantage I foresee in returning to Axe spec is regulating DPS in raids. Sometimes you could get a triple proc, all crits, and pull aggro instantly. With more regulated DPS from +5% crit it will probably be easier to control aggro and maintain DPS.\n\nFor PvP? If you rely on Sword Spec procs to kill people then either rethink your tactics, gear or playing style. If it's just a nice thing to \/flex \/gloat about then really it's not much of an extra string to your bow...critting more on spells ftw IMO.\n\nBut then again, other people prefer Sword Spec, some people even prefer Mace Spec - it's just down to personal choice.\n\n\n\nEdited, Tue May  2 22:40:08 2006","date":"2006-05-03T02:39:33-05:00","rating":-6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Othendras","importedSubject":"Sword Spec vs. Axe Spec"},{"commentv2":1,"number":62,"id":3084463,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Kinda waste to give it to a shaman who will only contribute with it in PvP...

Mana. They do not have to worry about it.\n\nLet's talk about how this wpn would perform where it really matters.\nIn battlegrounds. In this situation , warriors and rougues turn the tables a little. They have one significant advantage. Mana as well, and in BGs ironically it's they who do not have to worry about it this time.\n\nOne of the reasons why warriors seem to chew up everything and seems much more effective in a real situation than duels is that they do not need to be concerned about mana, just health. An experienced warrior that can catch a mana user offguard(after mages fn and burn their blink for example, or mana users resting)or with low or near zero reserves of mana has a significant advantage.\n\nTagging a good warrior with this wpn with a good healer would out perform\npallies, shamans tagged similarily with another healer in long engaged fights. Easily.\n\nEle shamans , yeah power, but without mana they drop like a sandbag,\nas with all mana classes. I've seen very good warriors (and rougues of course)exploit mana reliance very effectively, selectively choosing and waiting for opponents to wear down their mana and CDs, then chewing them up.\n\nDuels are like the firing range, everything changes in war.","date":"2006-08-25T17:40:01-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"So you are saying that warriors can only \"own\" when they are fighting people who arent at their full potential? thats just silly, thats like saying i could outrun a car, it just has to have no fuel.\n","creationdate":"2006-09-02T23:03:25-05:00","id":1287206,"rating":-4,"commentid":3084549,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"epsleon","importedSubject":"r u really pwning?"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"criszean","importedSubject":"r u really pwning?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":148,"id":3084550,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"1.About those dump players who speak about pallys like they can be DD - get something in ur mind , paladin has nothing to do with DD not even close .. ive seen a post here where someone goes like this \"If u get a paladin some nice DD gear u can just sit down and let the warrior hit u like 4 times .. then u just hit him 1 time for all those times ..\" or something like that .. about that guy .. 1 word \"UNINSTALL WOW\". ill even give u an example (with new lvl 70 cap and new talents\" this is even for those who think 2H warrios cant DPS .. lets see 2 month ago i was using AR (Arcanite Reaper) that not quite good as this one .. with pvp gear + some other stuff (live warrior own buffs) i could get like 500 base dmg ..

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Quoted from below: <br /><br />&quot;Sword spec &gt; Axe spec for PvP. <br /><br />Let's take hamstring, one of the most spammed ability in PvP. With axe spec, you have a 5% higher chance to do ~100 damage instead of 45. With sword spec, you have a 5% chance to basically get a free swing for just 10 rage. <br /><br />Am I saying that warriors shouldn't use this weapon? Of course not. But if you look at all the variables, from a PvP standpoint this might not be the absolute best weapon for a warrior.&quot;<br /><br />_____________________________________________<br /><br />You're looking at only one side of the argument. Another side is as thus:<br /><br />5% more crit instead of 5% chance to get an extra attack = 5% more chance to crit SPELLS. A Mortal Strike crit, for example, will do more damage than a Mortal Strike hit and an addition normal hit from Sword Spec. This is firstly due to the fact that Mortal Strike hits for more than a normal hit, and thus 2x this hit is more than a single MS hit and normal hit. Secondly, +5% crit is friendly for all Warriors with the &quot;Impale&quot; talent which adds an additional +20% damage on Spell Criticals. The same goes for Whirlwind, Heroic Strike, Cleave, and so on. In the end, IMO, Axe Spec = Sword Spec in terms of how good it is - it's just different.<br /><br />One advantage I foresee in returning to Axe spec is regulating DPS in raids. Sometimes you could get a triple proc, all crits, and pull aggro instantly. With more regulated DPS from +5% crit it will probably be easier to control aggro and maintain DPS.<br /><br />For PvP? If you rely on Sword Spec procs to kill people then either rethink your tactics, gear or playing style. If it's just a nice thing to /flex /gloat about then really it's not much of an extra string to your bow...critting more on spells ftw IMO.<br /><br />But then again, other people prefer Sword Spec, some people even prefer Mace Spec - it's just down to personal choice.<br /><br />Edited, Tue May 2 22:40:08 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok wat JRW said is all true just want to go a little more in depth. <br />35 str=70 AP for a warrior<br />1 dps=14 AP so 70/14=5<br />19=.95 crit from what I understand a crit chance calculates roughly to 20 AP so 19 in thise case.<br /><br />Thats 86.6 dps+5 from the str and another 1.4 if you count the crit as AP <br />In total that is exactly 93 dps where as Ashkandi has 87 dps after you factor the AP<br /><br />Yes Ashkandi has a slower speed but would u really go with a slow weapon and give up an extra 6 dps and that awesome proc? Up to you. <br />On a side note you could also factor in the axe/sword spec but imo that is preference.<br /><br />Edited, Fri May 12 18:04:30 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i kinda want to post something after reading all the this class pwns this and that class pwns that.<br /><br />Why are u guys always talking in relation to 1-1 situations,<br />in terms of duels? <br /><br />Duels are highly controlled.<br />There's already one significant advantage for pallies, shamans, mages,<br />warlocks, priests, maybe hunters. Mana. They do not have to worry about it.<br /><br />Let's talk about how this wpn would perform where it really matters.<br />In battlegrounds. In this situation , warriors and rougues turn the tables a little. They have one significant advantage. Mana as well, and in BGs ironically it's they who do not have to worry about it this time.<br /><br />One of the reasons why warriors seem to chew up everything and seems much more effective in a real situation than duels is that they do not need to be concerned about mana, just health. An experienced warrior that can catch a mana user offguard(after mages fn and burn their blink for example, or mana users resting)or with low or near zero reserves of mana has a significant advantage.<br /><br />Tagging a good warrior with this wpn with a good healer would out perform<br />pallies, shamans tagged similarily with another healer in long engaged fights. Easily.<br /><br />Ele shamans , yeah power, but without mana they drop like a sandbag,<br />as with all mana classes. I've seen very good warriors (and rougues of course)exploit mana reliance very effectively, selectively choosing and waiting for opponents to wear down their mana and CDs, then chewing them up.<br /><br />Duels are like the firing range, everything changes in war.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1.About those dump players who speak about pallys like they can be DD - get something in ur mind , paladin has nothing to do with DD not even close .. ive seen a post here where someone goes like this &quot;If u get a paladin some nice DD gear u can just sit down and let the warrior hit u like 4 times .. then u just hit him 1 time for all those times ..&quot; or something like that .. about that guy .. 1 word &quot;UNINSTALL WOW&quot;. ill even give u an example (with new lvl 70 cap and new talents&quot; this is even for those who think 2H warrios cant DPS .. lets see 2 month ago i was using AR (Arcanite Reaper) that not quite good as this one .. with pvp gear + some other stuff (live warrior own buffs) i could get like 500 base dmg .. (with medium gear) not epics and like a 32% crit chanse .. now 500+125+100+315=1040+(critx2)=2080+416(20% talent)=2496 UPS! getting in armor penalty and stuff will drop ip to 2240 max .. so i think its pretty nice .. and im not even counting the &quot;buffs&quot; u could get in party .. this dmg is from a solo warrior with medium gear .... so dont dream about those 4 hits :) couse ur getting only 1 or 2.<br /><br />2.About those other stupid ppl about getting a 2h Axe for Shaman .. u really must be kidding us ... like paladin if u get OOM ur dead .. even a @#$%ing lvl 50 ANY CLASS can kill u if u get OOM .. paladins kick ur ass becouse they can heal anytime they want .. goes the same for shamans becouse they can own ur ass with those tottems+forstshock and stuff combos .. so just stick to not loosing ur mana in 10 sec and die becouse u got an epic axe xD<br /><br />3.Dude ur shaman crit for 3.5K ? 3x Windfury ? lol that means a warrior can crit for over 8K if a shaman was that much dmg xD (with windfury)<br /><br />That all .. see u guys around next time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sword spec &gt; Axe spec for PvP.<br /><br />Let's take hamstring, one of the most spammed ability in PvP. With axe spec, you have a 5% higher chance to do ~100 damage instead of 45. With sword spec, you have a 5% chance to basically get a free swing for just 10 rage.<br /><br />Am I saying that warriors shouldn't use this weapon? Of course not. But if you look at all the variables, from a PvP standpoint this might not be the absolute best weapon for a warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Imo, either pally/war/shammy, but NEVER a hunter, i understand, you raided, earned dkp, and want to spend it...and thats a kickass axe! But its main attribute (its WICKED dps) would go to waste in a hunters hands, because hunters use range 90% of the time. Yea, it has nice stats, but its STILL A MELEE WEAPON. I wouldnt have wanted my crossbow of smiting to go to a rogue cause of the 1337 dps and stats, thats just ridiculous! Like i said before, pally/war/shammy priority, (but no priority between the 3) &lt; I have a hunter and a warrior that both raid Bwl, so i can talk from BOTH sides of the table.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this is a nuts weapon in anycase, highest dps in the game... it does more than sulfuras so this weapon would be good for anyone, 20 extra dmg for a hunter in ranged is pretty damn good so i believe if a hunter really wanted it his/her guild would give it to them. i hate when ppl argue about what class each weapon is for, as long as that particualr character uses it right and isnt a noob then it shouldnt matter, though i dont know many 60 noobs in high lvl instance raid guilds. either way palladins suck and take it up the butt any chance they get, i cant wait to get this weapon with either my hunter OR my warrior since it cleary works for both... given that i bid u all a good day. ppl need to quit bittchin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>effyouzion</b></h3>One of the three best two-handed weapons in Classic WoW, along with <a href="/classic/item=22691/corrupted-ashbringer">Corrupted Ashbringer</a> and <a href="/classic/item=22798/might-of-menethil">Might of Menethil</a>.<br /><br />Dark Edge is comparable to Might of Menethil on a warrior. The proc on Dark Edge acts as an equivalent to mace specialization, while Dark Edge also benefits from axe specialization. The end result is that Dark Edge crits more often, while MoM has more raw damage.<br /><br />Ashbringer has the most burst damage of the three thanks to its proc and sword specialization, but the extra damage comes at the cost of -25 stamina. Given the large stamina values on the other two weapons, this is a swing in 500-670 health, which is easily 10% (or more!) of your unbuffed health pool in aggressive gear.<br /><br />In PvE, Dark Edge is the best by default, because two-handers are only truly viable on horde side (thanks to Windfury Totem) and only Orcs get two-handed axe skill. <br /><br />As a warrior, you would be happy with any of these three weapons!</div>
