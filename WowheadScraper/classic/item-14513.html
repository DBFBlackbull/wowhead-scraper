<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7423</b></h3>I remember about a year ago, we had one of these drop every run in 6 runs, we all rolled for the pattern and the winner sold it for about 300g everytime.<br /><br />This was a great robe for pre Molten core mages, however soon becomes replaced.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Which means you cannot trade the robe...the only way to have it is to be a tailor</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The're just below the spider section in LBRS.<br /><br />The drop rates listed seem a bit optimistic. I've been through there many times but have only seen it drop once. OTOH, getting the drop isn't the hard part. Getting the 10 essences of air, water, fire, and earth is; particularly the air.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Our five man group had this pattern drop last night.&nbsp; The group was:<br />Hunter (60), Hunter (60), Warlock (60), Priest (57), and Warrior (60).&nbsp; I (the priest) was the only tailor there, and I'm not at 300 tailoring yet.&nbsp; We all rolled, and the guy that won it looted it just fine.&nbsp; (He sold it to a guild mage later that night.)<br /><br />Also, you can get all the essences in about 3-4 days of farming.&nbsp; I had 10-25 of each essence sitting in my bank before my mage got this pattern.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Two days ago I posted the previous comment, and I started to run LBRS yesterday and today. Since I know where the pattern will drop, I made sure that I kill all those pyro before the spiders' room. Just as my raid group passed on those pyro and started to pull the spiders, I pull and killed the pyromancers myself. Guess what? On the second pyro...the pattern drop... I won the roll, but people started to say I ninja'ed it. Its so obvious that Im the only mage and also a tailor too, that pattern should come to me. Oh well, whatever. <br />I will post the pic whenever I can make the robes, since I just spent so much money on the mats for belt of archmage and the +30 spell damage enchant.<br />PS. dont try to go to LBRS just for this pattern with a pick-up group...its bad, there will try to outroll you cause the pattern is boe. My suggestion is to go as a guild run. Good Luck to all the mages who run LBRS countless hours for this.<br />Marjoly lv 60 human mage &quot;There is nothing feeling better than crit your frostbolt for 2k dmg with frostbite on those cow faces&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone can loot the pattern.<br /><br />But anyone who gets the pattern and is not a Mage should auction it.&nbsp; The item it creates binds on pickup, and can only be equipped by a Mage.<br /><br />So if you're a 300 Tailor Warlock, you can learn the pattern and make the Robe, but you'll just be stuck with a <b>soulbound</b> Robe that <b>you can't equip since you're not a Mage</b>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>+dmg is nice when you have the time to sit back and lob 1100 non crit fireballs at an NPC.&nbsp; However, in PvP, esp. Battlegrounds, you're not going to have enough time (usually only the first shot while sheeped) to launch a 3sec fireball.&nbsp; Therefor, the +crit on your scorches, Fireblasts, CoC, IAE etc really becomes a factor.&nbsp; Plus, your instant cast spells only benefit minimally from the +dmg.&nbsp; (1.5sec = 40% of total +dmg gear i think)&nbsp; Keep a +dmg/int suit for PvE, for PvP use +stam/+crit.&nbsp; That simple.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This dropped in group and we all rolled because PATTERN IS BOE BUT ONCE IT'S LEARNED THE ROB IS BOA. That means that once a mage buys the pattern from me, he can only create robes for himself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I believe at one point the pattern itself as well as the robe were both BoP.&nbsp; However that was changed with one of the patches so that the patterns can be traded/sold but the robe once made is soulbound.&nbsp; That might part of the reason for the confusion on if the item is BoP or not</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is possible !<br />Juste go with a pack of Invibility potions (10 to be sure).<br />Kill the two first mobs of the instance by sheeping one, then regen and take him down.<br />Wait for the thrid guard to come and do the same.<br />Then go to the right, jump, regen and run :)<br />Aggro everything you want and go ahead, then jump from the clif to the right.<br />Wait ON THE LITTLE STEP befor the ground for them to loose aggro.<br />Then jump down and take down de Firebrand grunt who is patroling in the area, then use a potion and run as fast as you can (don't use transfert while stealth) and when the stealth effect is going to leave, use your transfert to get in a safe zone and wait for 10 minutes for the cooldown to be up ^^ Then use it again to pass over the last mob pack and you'll be right next the pyromancers !<br />Then, sheep the demonist if possible or pull them away (by pulling the one who is at the right) and sheep, then nova and focus the pyromancer.<br />If you've chosen the good specialisation, you'll be able to get rid of the three :)<br /><br />Forgive my pretty bad english and hope you'll understand that :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've run quite a few lbrs run in my time and i can say that the drop rate for this is probably correct. I'm not 100% about u having have some1 with 300 tailoring for this to drop and i've seen to drop a fair amount and I have alchemy and herbalism. None the less i drop herbalism to make the robe and didnt regard how expesive it would be to lvl up tailoring.<br /><br />Anyway Took a few days but I have it, the essences are to have to get when u can transmute them, if u ask/pay an alchemist they can transmute water to air (probably the easiest to the hard essences to get) <br /><br />Anyway good luck getting it if ur a mage its well worth the effort :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i wonder if they've nerfed the drop chance of this. used to get approx 1/10 runs, but now i've done over 40 pyromancer kills now without it dropping. sure it's possible that i'm just being really unlucky, but it's like 3.5% chance for this so it's stretching odds abit.<br /><br />anyone else having problems finding the pattern as of latest patch?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>u can farm them as combat rogue. <br /><br />there are 3 groups<br /><br />1. Pyromancer Dreadweaver in the back corner, sap kill the other, then kill the sapped.<br /><br />2. Go into that corner there they was, and pull the left group, pop everything, Eva+AR+BF, aoe grind them, if u are lucky BF hitting the Dreadweaver, so u can kill him too. Sometimes i can kill all the groups, but usually iam not risking anything, killing the Pyromancer, and vanish, w8 for CD-s.<br /><br />3. kill the right group, go up to the hill, ranged pull, pop everything, aoe grind, loot, vanish, reset. <br /><br />gl &lt;3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This robe costs about 400g to produce - and that's not counting the pattern. Unless u grind the mats yourselves</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For laughs I was running through LBRS, was thinking about making a key or something when I come across the pyromancers. My pet wasn't even out, but all you have to do as a marksman hunter is just aimed shot one and blast it down on the way to you. by the time the mobs reach you it'll be dead and you can feign and loot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been to LBRS at least 15 times. I have yet to see this pattern drop. I gave up my engineering of 253 to take up tailoring just for this pattern. That was about 3+ months ago. Looking at the postings here, it looks like it's time for some serious farming with a group of close friends. Wish me luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does 30 gold and 20 gold sound cheap for this pattern?<br /><br />Well I was auction surfing and picked up one.. and could have picked up two, but thought something wa sup.. Well, in one week the price went from 150-200 gold to about 80-100 gold.. gonna wait a couple of weeks for the price to go back up before auctioning that.. Prices are really defunct on Alexstraxa server.. Mostly just going through growing pains.. It is only a 6 month old server and all. Dunno.. lol, a lot of farmers and pure solo grinders on the server. Wish it was PvP so I could kill all of them. <br /><br />Funnily enough I have to farm that boss for my Recipe: Greater Fire Protection Potion.. lol, I am a leatherwearing NE Rogue - Level 60 :D<br /><br />GOOD LUCK ALL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd drop a profession to power level my tailoring if i came up on this recipe, can always swap back later, but that takes a lot of farming</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I cant believe that this item was sold for so little. I know that it has dropped dramatically in price recently but it will go back up to over 100g. I bought 4 of them at 17g each on AH from a buyout.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a 31 arcane/20 fire mage and have duoed to the pyromancers a couple of times with a similarly specced mage. Great fun, but no pattern. Finally got the pattern in a PuG 10-man, and I was the only mage :) There does NOT need to be a tailor in the group. I was herbalism/alchemy when I got the pattern, then dropped herbalism and ended up spending about 450g powerlevelling tailoring and compiling all the materials for the robe. I still dislike the complete lack of stamina on the robe (I put +100 health on it), but the +40 damage can't be beat. I ended up passing on Robes of Volatile Power when they dropped the day after I made this. &gt;.&gt;</div>

Keep right until you need to jump off the upper room to lbrs. Stop in front of the mobs with the wolves. Then just run and keep right... Jump down three times and you will land safely.<br /><br />If you bombed everything away, undress and take a bath in the lava. Reset -&gt; redo.<br /><br />Took us 3 runs to find the pattern with lots of belts and bracers dropping. We found a &quot;Recipe: Greater Fire Protection Potion&quot; too.</div>
