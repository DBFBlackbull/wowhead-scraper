They use a shout that dazes you and keeps you from running quickly. Use whatever method you would normally use to get out of a slowing daze or avoid a fight.

If you pick one up, then an elite or two will spawn. I have a rogue so I unwittingly picked one up, and sprinted away. When I came back, the Fallen Hero was still there. They spawn in plaguelands rarely.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>issachar</b></h3>I have seen 3 different spawns all around Lake Mereldar in Eastern Plaguelands. Some are a few paces away from the lake and require a slight bit of exploring.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8761</b></h3>I have been gathering these in order to get my epic pants (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12903">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12903</a>). I have found that the best way to go about finding them is just run a circle route around andorhal over to scholo and up to the writhing haunt in WPL, and then in EPL from Light's Hope Chapel over all the way to the edge of EPL near the WPL entrance and then up and around the blightcaller's house. Don't forget to check inside his house (feign death FTW!). I can usually find 2 per full circuit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sware</b></h3>Blood of Heroes are located in Eastern Plaguelands and Western Plaguelands, they're uncommon to find so you may have to search a bit. <br /><br />Becareful as you loot them as 2 elites 'Fallen Heroes' spawn and have a shout that greatly cripples your moment speed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thurissan</b></h3>Here's the deal with Blood of Heroes~ They can only spawn in the Eastern or Western Plaguelands, they are pretty hard to find and have a massive region over to where to spawn and very few do spawn. NOW BE CAREFUL, once looted, it can spawn 1, 2, or 3 Fallen Heroes, they are 58-60 elites that have a 60 second duration AoE shout that slows you down pretty big time while wailing on you, which makes escaping pretty much impossible, I advise you to get something that can dispel immobolization spells such as that to escape. The Fallen Heroes themselves are not rare spawns, they despawn in a range of 1-3 hours if left alive to wreak havok and prevent the spawning of the next Blood of Heroes at that spot until they are gone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9029</b></h3>As a shaman, it's actually quite easy to do this. Just have your PvP trinket on (The Insignia of the Horde), open the Blood of Heroes, loot it. When the heroes come out &amp; slow you down, quickly use the Insignia, pop Ghost Wolf, slap an Earthbind Totem down and then run away.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>33826</b></h3>also works fine with a rogue. i loot them with my 52 rogue, then use vanish the second i get the item. works like a charm:D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had been searching off an on for several weeks and then finally found one by accident last night.&nbsp; My problem I discovered, was that I was looking for a graphic of a white object with blood in the middle like the screenshot shown above.&nbsp; But the one I found on the northeastern corner of andorhal yesterday had no red in it at all.&nbsp; It looked just like a little white pile of dirt, much smaller than I had envisioned.&nbsp; So I guess I'm saying, keep a very close look out cause they can be really really hard to spot.&nbsp; <br /><br />Night</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is the definitive way to achieve the above.<br />Fly to WP, mount up and run to EP, looking for BoH along the way. When you're in the EP, run over to Lake Mereldar, jump in and look for the red log. At one end you will find BoH. Repeat this every 1/2 an hour or once a night until you have all you need.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found 5 in 1 and 1/2 hours.&nbsp; 2 randomly on the ground in EPL.&nbsp; 1 in the house at Marris Stead. 2 in the lake south of Corrin's Crossing.&nbsp; I stopped looking after, because I only needed 5.&nbsp; Don't believe the one a day thing.&nbsp; The points I found them at are all shown on the map by the way.&nbsp; So, I wouldn't bother looking anywhere not on the map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>even with the maps, i'm having trouble finding them. i found one in WPL at a point that wasn't even on the map too. only need one more for my libram so that i can go get my ZG enchant. <br /><br />yes rogues do need them as well....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Try EPL`s lake bottoms .. usualy dead heroes that drop these .. be ready to fight the 59 elite that guards them or run out of the water, the elite spawns after you looted corpse</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found my first pool at level 56 farming Gahrren's Withering. See a blood of heroes on the ground. 3 other people in the area, nobody's taken it yet.<br /><br />Okay, let's see what this is all about shall we.<br /><br />Loot, hmm blood of heroes, crap inventory full of vendor tra... &quot;HOW DARE YOU DEFILE THIS HOLY PLACE!&quot; WHAT? Now I have one hell of a nasty pissed off level 60 elite on me. Ok time to take off... oh LOVELY... 60 second hamstring. So in the heat of the moment, I do what any illogical person would do, I psychic scream the thing. Despite being undead, it works, too bad the hamstring is 60 seconds and scream is 6. I manage to get a distance on shields and renews, and scream it off a second time and it unaggros. Geez.<br /><br />So of course, I go back to see what the hell that was all about, and its huge aggro radius gets it on me again. Another fun run with the 60 second hamstring and screaming. No more playing with that thing.<br /><br />So later on, I see one of these in the Bulwark. Based on my earlier experiences, I left it there for some level 12 exploring the area to click on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sublect says it all.&nbsp; Im a lvl 60 pally and can take a 60 or 61 elites when it spawns.&nbsp; However when two spawn it is time to do one of two things: <br />1) Bubble hearth (not my favorite)or<br />2) Shield and run like hell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found out that the ghosts that spawn hate water. So if you're by a body of it, and cant vanish or anything, swim. Its hard to get away from them otherwise with that shout that slows you for like 50 seconds...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>That's what I do and I've gotten 6 so far without even coming close to dying.&nbsp; Drink one before you loot and they won't be able to put that shout on you and you can run away no problem (although they can still daze, but I've only been dazed once and I was fine).&nbsp; I bought ten for 5g or so but it's worth not having to run back to your corpse and pay for a repair bill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thank you for the Coordinates above.&nbsp; With the exception of a few, on August 9, 2006 I verified some, and made corrections, as provided here:<br /><b>1.&nbsp; 21,74&nbsp; (EPL)<br />2.&nbsp; 29,78&nbsp; (EPL)<br />3.&nbsp; 35,73&nbsp; (EPL)<br />4.&nbsp; 50,77&nbsp; (EPL)<br />5.&nbsp; 69,71&nbsp; (EPL)<br />6.&nbsp; 70,75&nbsp; (WPL Caer Darrow)<br />7.&nbsp; 68,84&nbsp; (WPL Caer Darrow)<br />8.&nbsp; 62,57&nbsp; (WPL)<br />9.&nbsp; 43,70&nbsp; (WPL)<br />10.&nbsp; 36,54&nbsp; (WPL)</b><br /><br />From the coordinates provided by others listed above I could not verify 26,74 (EPL); 20,66 (EPL); 51,67 (EPL); 65,75 (WPL); 46,59 (WPL); or 40,73 (WPL).&nbsp; <br /><br />Of the two I found at Scourge Fields in WPL, I noticed that they shift from one side of the field to the other on respawn.<br /><br />Regarding the two near Scholo, one spawned right at the southern edge of the bridge (as you look at the map), the other spawned right next to the campfire adjacent to the Scholo instance entrance (just outside).<br /><br />For the first time I found a benefit to server crash/down time.&nbsp; Upon reboot of the server, (I'm on Lagbringer), the blood pools spawn.&nbsp; Not all, but most.&nbsp; I searched for 6 months and only found one, but after reboot I found 8 in one hour mostly because there were only 7 other people playing by the time the server reloaded. So, if you can log on near the time the server reboots, there should be several pools.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some of the blood pools have a respawn time of approximately 8 hours, others are 12 and 24 hours. Depending on your server, the coordinates may vary slightly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a very unlucky man. Listen to what anyone careless enough can get... I was in Anachronos server with my blood elf paladin logged in. I was minding my own business (questing etc) so my road led me to the place where the argent dawn camp is, to the borders with the plaguelands. Well, i thought it was a good idea to speak to one man there so as to get the faction status in my reputation pannel. And guess what, i saw a shiny pool of blood that was usuable... The strange and terrible about it was that its place was not in plaguelands, but inside the very same TIRISFAL GLADES ITSELF! Just almost inside the argent dawn camp and the usual forest of TIRISFAL, GLADES... Not knowing what it was, thought it might be a hidden quest triggering thing or something like that, and SHIFT+right clicked it without knowing it was lootable, i always do that. A level ?elite raped me literally and i didn 't know what the hell hit me, until i read about the item here. Both blood patch and elite terror spawned inside TIRISFAL! I could never imagine something so strong could exist inside such a low level area... 22 level paladin, got the enemy 2 hits to kill me, hehe, paladins are the last to drop dead, surely! ;) Beware everyone who sees this blood in tirisfal area-near the argent dawns to NOT PICK IT UP etc or you are in for some BIIIG trouble. Pretty annoying the least to say...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As best I can tell, there are no quest givers at all for this item and it has no use other than to make a few items via alchemy (and now jewelcrafting, apparently). They cannot be sold to a vendor and they bind when picked up, so you cannot give them away or sell them on AH.<br />They spawn at random through out both Western and Eastern Plaguelands, rarely in the same places too often.<br />Every time you grab it, one or two lvl 60-65+ Fallen Hero ghosts will appear and attack you. They use a shout that dazes you and keeps you from running quickly. Use whatever method you would normally use to get out of a slowing daze or avoid a fight. (Feign death, shield, sprint, etc. or just strip down nekkid to avoid damage costs and let them kill you lol) They disappear after a bit of time, and they don't chase you for very long. Or if you just want the extra xp, bring a few friends and attempt to fight them :P<br />Personally, I think the blood is useless if you aren't trying to get the special items they make, or don't have any recipes that include them. But it's fun to just grab and run with them.<br />Happy hunting!<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 7th 2007 1:01am by Sylraine</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's certainly part of the quest <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5167">Legplates of the Chromatic Defier</a><br /><br />I happened upon one of these months ago and got rid of it. Today I searched for 5 minutes and found one, and then for an hour and didn't find any more.

Figured I might do ZG sometime and I knew that the dude spawns so I ate up, and then looted. About a second before I finished I got hit with PUTRID BILE from a gargoyle, the undead spawned, and I didn't even loot. Trying to outrun that #$%^ without being able to heal, at 40% movement speed, wearing nothing but cloth hurt. But I lived, came back, pwnted the elite and got my one blood ^^. Course, the gargoyle came back just after I looted, but thankfully, the heroes don't spawn x2.</div>

All you need is your PvP trinket to dispel slows and some commonplace moves.<br />-Find a blood and make sure the way is clear of mobs. Figure out which way you're going to run.<br />-Hit Bloodrage, then shift-loot to get the blood right away.<br />-When the heroes spawn and start attacking, start running and hit your Intimidating Shout. I have never seen this resisted by the heroes.<br />-Once they're feared, hit your PvP trinket to remove the slowing effect and run like hell until they stop chasing you.<br /><br />Try it out sometime, it worked flawlessly for all ten of my bloods. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>One spawned inside the house where you find Nathanos Blightcaller in EPL. First time I ever saw one, so I looted it, a 60 elite popped so of course I panicked. DoTed him, feared and wanded him down while he tried to kill my voidwalker. After that I've found 3 more just questing in EPL in one day. All of them popped 2 elites, so the clue here is to just run away. Bring your swiftness potions and nifty stopwatch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found 2x within 5 min.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is used for afew quest items. There are some armor quests (now mostly worthless with BC) as well as the Libram quests in Dire Maul that grant a head or leg enchant and are still somewhat usefull. Might be others I'm not aware of, but those are the main ones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So this stuff spawns - what - once per day on each server? I've been scouring the plaguelands 2 hours a day for the last 2 weeks and haven't seen one yet, and I need 10 for the quest I'm on. Yeah - the game's been <i>REAL</i> interesting for a while now.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Dec 16 10:31:02 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>WPL 68,50 hehe wasn't expecting 2 59 elites to pop out</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>both in WPL, close to ruins of andorhal.<br /><br />First time, didn't know.. only just made it away alive.<br /><br />Second time, knew better.. dropped trap, looted, set pet and ran.<br />They chase you for a fair while, so it's not a good idea to just randomly run or you'll get adds.<br /><br />make sure you've got a clear path, the slowing spell is worse than walking speed.<br /><br />I feigned, and ran.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>From what I can tell, the blood of heros show up randomly. I found three in andorhal, and one by a scourge cauldron. Two of the ones I found in Andorhal were near a tower. The first one was on one side of the path on my first check. After I looted it, I kept searching. About a half hour later, I came back to see if it had respawned, and found the second one on the other side of the path. I conclude from this unscientific observation that they appear randomly.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Oct 13 17:58:46 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Devisaur</b></h3>I recently found one of these in Gahrron's Withering. I proceeded to loot the item only for it to bug out and not give me the Blood of Heroes. The model was still clickable but nothing happened. The add still spawned with it. I submitted a bug report.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xectra</b></h3>It's all nice and all locations confirmed for blood of heroes, i went to most locations posted here.<br />Then when i finally found one!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Geryth</b></h3>If you're looking for locations of these, there's a decently accurate list on the node page for this item. I have found one blood of heroes that did NOT have a pin on those maps, in Caer Darrow, just north of the docks, so it's not all inclusive, but this list helped me find the 4 I was after for Libram of Rapidity materials.<br /><br />Node page is here: <a href="/classic/object=176213/blood-of-heroes">Blood of Heroes</a><br /><br />Don't forget to swap zones to see WPL nodes vs EPL nodes (zone links are just above the map).<br /><br />If you're using Tomtom I went ahead and used the WPL map above to create a bunch of waypoint markers. I was too lazy to do EPL, sorry. You can put these in a macro and activate the macro to place the waypoints. Macros have a 255 character limit so I chunked them up into pieces that can fit into a single macro.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>EDHD</b></h3>Looking at the reagents for, and objectives of TAB, theses seem to be useless to me as a non Alchemist Druid. Because I can't craft anything with them and the gear from quest can't be worn (excluding the Arcanium of Rapidity). Just wanted to see if I am missing anything on this. I randomly came across one not knowing what it was about and now it's taking up a slot in bags, that are never big enough.</div>
