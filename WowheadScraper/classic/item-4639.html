<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xLunacyx</b></h3>Murloc Genocide is pretty typical to find this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Punie</b></h3>You don't need any quest to get this item.<br /><br />The item is used to summon a boss (<a href="/classic/npc=2937/dagun-the-ravenous">Dagun the Ravenous</a>), to get <a href="/classic/item=4641/hand-of-dagun">Hand of Dagun</a>, which is needed for the quest (Alliance) <a href="/classic/quest=735/the-star-the-hand-and-the-heart">The Star, the Hand and the Heart</a> / <a href="/classic/quest=736/the-star-the-hand-and-the-heart">The Star, the Hand and the Heart</a> (Horde)<br /><br />Which is part of a quest chain to get <a href="/classic/item=4984/skull-of-impending-doom">Skull of Impending Doom</a> , one out of many useful PvP items.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BTS82</b></h3>Had this in my bank for a long time and didn't know what it was for. So I tried it on the altar, killed the giant and got no loot. Killed two respawning Oracles and got another. Used it on the altar again and killed the giant, still no loot.<br />Checked this page, facepalmed and headed back towards Theramore. Aggroed some murlocs, killed them and guess what they dropped?<br />A third enchanted sea kelp🤷‍♂️</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Malakhi</b></h3>The kelp will drop even if you don't have the quest. I was able to get several times while killing murlocs for their heads, in the mid to high 30's, long before the star hand heart quest becomes available. The last time I did it I cleared the island for 90 minutes before it finally dropped.</div>
