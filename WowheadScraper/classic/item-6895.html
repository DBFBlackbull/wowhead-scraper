Still worked just fine.","creationdate":"2021-01-28T14:01:41-06:00","id":1446243,"rating":0,"commentid":3177527,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"JustRob","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}}];

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this today. My char has 2000 AC (with shield) and ~1100HP at 23 unbuffed, and was able to solo this today. It took time and patience. Hardest part was the prison jailor. It seemed like it took continuous self-healing to finally kill the elite worg add, then a lay on hands to get my HP back to normal. Then it was pretty easy to kill the jailor when it was only 1 on 1. <br /><br />In the courtyard there were a couple of lvl 20 elites that were linked, but those were pretty easy to handle. Oh, if you are cursed with haunting, you will have non-elite ghost add-ons. These die with one blow, so kill them off quick.<br /><br />Agree with hugging the left wall. Jordan's hammer is right in front of you as you enter the stable after hugging the left wall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, I just want to say for the record that I think the posts on here are really misleading even taking into account that everyone who posts on these boards is some sort of &quot;Super Internet Pali&quot; that is able to kill armies of monsters without breaking a sweat.&nbsp; Here is the reality in my case:<br /><br />It took me forever to find Shadowfang.&nbsp; Ultimately, I started in Menethril, hoofed it up through the Wetlands, went West to get to Silverpine forest through the Atharac Mountains.&nbsp; You can pretty much follow the road the whole way there, BUT:<br /><br />As soon as you get North of the Wetlands the monsters are pretty high level. Not bad if you stay on the road.&nbsp; There is a posse of undead that escourts a courier along the road.&nbsp; They will work you in a bad way if your paths cross.&nbsp; Be on the lookout for them.&nbsp; Getting through the Altarac Mt's is tough as there are some pretty high level folks through there.&nbsp; Once you get to Silverpine stay on the roads and use the signs to find the keep.&nbsp; I looked forever until I started using the signs.&nbsp; The keep is up a side road to the right as you approach the town.<br /><br />The instance should not be solo'ed by a low level Paladin.&nbsp; I'm level 26.&nbsp; I joined up with a 21 (who was WAY to low to do this by himself) and a 33.&nbsp; Maybe there is a way to carefully make your way through this thing so you don't fight many monsters, but here was my experience:<br /><br />You fight several waves getting through the initial part of the keep.&nbsp; This isn't too bad and is as described by the posts.&nbsp; Then this guy opens a door for you and you go through and the place is PACKED with undead, Worgs, and the like.&nbsp; It's ugly. The level 21 died once.&nbsp; I had to use quite a few mana potions and had a couple of close calls.&nbsp; I'm glad we had the 33 with us.<br /><br />Once you actually get to the stable this isn't so bad and the hammer is sitting right there.&nbsp; There is some rumor about getting a 10 slot bag if you fight the horses.&nbsp; We fought and killed the horses and let me tell you--IT IS NOT TRUE :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Don't die whatever you do, the run back is a *!@#$, all the way from southshore</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found the easiest way to get to southshore was to swim from the wetlands.&nbsp; You avoid all the super high lvl horde and mobs that way.&nbsp; Just stay on the surface while swimming to avoid the nasties in the sunken reef.&nbsp; I made it no sweat like that.&nbsp; Walking thru Arathi at lvl 25 ended badly several times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Level 26, my 4th character.&nbsp; I had greens that required mid-teens i most slots, with Cruel Barb and Chausses of Westfall as my only blues.<br /><br />Only difficult part was the mini-boss. I died twice, once because I tried opening a cell without killing him and didn't have enough mana, the second time I succeeded in killing a dog but my attempt to get out the instance failed.&nbsp; If you can attempt to back up throughout the fight, you could conceivably kill a dog and get out.&nbsp; The fight vs the boss and the one dog wasn't a problem.<br /><br />It wasn't exactly a cake walk against the trash mobs either, generally burning one of my two bubbles each pull.<br /><br />I hope the weapons' worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got the Hammer at lvl 25 with help of a guild mate lvl 47 :D<br /><br />Getting to SoutShore isn't difficult you just have to be careful!<br /><br />Atrathi Highlands is the worst part you have to STAY ON THE ROAD and if you find the Horde patrol just jump off the road and wait untill they pass! If you are at lvl 25 just like me, you won't get too troubuled by finding a lvl 30 Raptor, that is 5 lvls higher than you! If you are almost dead just use Lay On Hands the trip to SoutShore will consume the Long Cooldown :D<br /><br />Don't try to solo it and call me what you want but I don't think that ShadowFang Keep it's soloable at lvl 22!<br /><br />I have a horde Char and I can say that SFK gave some good trouble!<br />Get some help maybe from a high lvl and it won't be dificult :)<br /><br />Have a nice trip and don't look to the raptors :)<br /><br />PS: Don't forget to get the flight Paths just like I did :( had to walk again :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Solod with lvl 24. I died once because i forgot lay on hands during the fight with Rattle. Be sure you have no cd when you enter the instance and know the way to the exit (you will spawn at the graveyard near ss oO).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i went into sfk, got like the only summon il ever have there, and we did a 10 man run, im doin it as i type this, and i got to the hammer, and it wont let me pick it up, the little gear icon wont show up when i put my mouse over it, its gay, i have the quest, even one item, but it lagged out i guess, should i try it again or report this&nbsp; to BLizz?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>SFK is easy to solo at lvl 24-25 (at least to get the hammer) Just take it REAL slow and try not to aggro things (at least not more than 2). I didn't die once. Just go into the instance and take it REAL slow and talk to the mage and get him to open the door. Once in the Courtyard, just take it real slow. The Horse Stall is acrost the Courtyard and the hammer is on a crate. Just don't attack the horses!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>solo'ed at 23 used 4 target dummy.<br /><br />for the cell part, jus jump down open the cell, and talk to the guy to open up the gate for u. After use divine shield, and quickly zone out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>thanks to the tips on all this i solod this instance till the hammer without using lay on hands and having to fight more than 2 mobs at the same time.<br /><br />i had cry of the dragonslayer on me so i critted alot more. i used bag of marbles(decreases 25% hit chance) when i got 2 mobs on me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can confirm this is very much soloable at 23.&nbsp; I just finished it (flying to Ironforge for my quest completion as I type), and I soloed each item.<br /><br />I'm not a twink; I've got a 22 Warrior who gave 10 gold to my Paladin to start off with, my Paladin now has 23 gold, so he's making money.&nbsp; The only non-green I have is my weapon, the Taskmaster Axe off Sneed, does 19.6 DPS.&nbsp; It's level 18, I've seen level 23 greens in the AH for less than a gold that do almost the same damage.&nbsp; My armor is crap; about 1000 armor before Devotion Aura.&nbsp; I didn't even use my shield.<br /><br />All you need to do is pull things to the entrance.&nbsp; Kill one thing, leave, heal up, enter, kill the remaining enemy.&nbsp; You can pull only one or two at a time.&nbsp; If you pull more, chances are one's faster than the others, so when it hits you at the entrance, leave; the others will run back, and it will sit there and wait for you alone.&nbsp; I killed the jailer this way, without fighting more than a single enemy at a time; dead easy.&nbsp; I died only once, and that was entirely my stupid mistake; I put off turning on Divine Shield and then missed the click when I tried.<br /><br />It's not fast, but it's not too terribly hard at level 23 even with mostly crap gear.&nbsp; I didn't even stock up on useables; I had no potions, and only 6 woolen bandages, and 7 glasses of milk.&nbsp; I still have one of each left, and the bandages I only used for the heck of it. <br /><br />Just follow the other tips here; pull 1-2 at a time, kill one, zone, heal, go back in if there's 2.&nbsp; Easy peasy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Level 26.&nbsp; <br />It is doable..&nbsp; just take it easy.&nbsp; The run over the highlands isn't bad.&nbsp; Make sure to stop at Refuge camp to get flight path..&nbsp; same for Southshore.&nbsp; Silverpine is a low Horde level area, so no problems (unless someone has an escort, then you're toast)<br /><br />I used a judged seal of crusader to pull people.&nbsp; Usually didn't get more than 2 guys.&nbsp; Judge often, heal often.&nbsp; Stun, Judge SoC, Heal works well.&nbsp; Only died once (in tiny area in front of cells w/ 4 guys). <br /><br />Be very careful in the courtyard.&nbsp; Take your time.&nbsp; Pull a Warg back up the stairs, then the two guys straight ahead on the left wall.&nbsp; Then a wandering undead, and finally one more warg.&nbsp; The stables are directly in front of you at end of left wall.&nbsp; One guy left in front of it, but now that everyone is gone you can pull him back and take your time. <br /><br />One guy inside stable..&nbsp; no big problem at this point.&nbsp; Grab the hammer (very visible) and hoof it back to Ironforge.&nbsp; Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>solo'd at 23.&nbsp; died a couple times.&nbsp; wasnt too bad though considering my level.&nbsp; certainly not super equipt</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lv 23 pally, took me about 2.5 hours, but I got the hammer, advice in the forum right on.&nbsp; Easy if you can pull 1, most case I could take two.&nbsp; Hardest was the cell guard.&nbsp; There I died twice, but the important thing is to at least kill one before you die.&nbsp; The first pass with 3 vs. 1, required lay on hands.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I solo'ed this at 22. You just have to pull no more than two at a time. On the cell keeper, if you pull the wolf at the bottom of the stairs from as far away as possible you'll aggro just the wolf and the cell keeper. I killed the wolf first. I had to blow everything to do this - divine protection, blessing of protection, lay on hands, a bandage, and a pot - so it's not by any means easy. I dps'd, bubbled, then bandages, dps more, bubbled for mana regen, etc. It's easier to spam flash of light because it's less likely to be interrupted, you can squeeze in an attack more often, and it costs less MP per Heal tick than holy light. You really must kill the wolf first because it hits for more and the keeper casts an immobilization debuff - you can actually heal through this and keeper doesn't hit hard. If you don't kill wolf first, it'll tear you up when you're immobilized.<br /><br />After this, I continued solo'ing. I died twice, the first time I tried to kill the cell keeper before the wolf, and a second time when one of the mobs in the courtyard summoned a haunted spirit. Use HoJ to interrupt the summon and it's much easier :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you can solo this as a lvl 23 pallie I just did It took me one hour you just have to keep runnin out of the instance everytime you kill one otherwise you can solo it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soloed this at lvl 29 pally. Quite challenging but simple and easy. Just take it slow and try to solo mobs one at a time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Jordan's Smithing Hammer is very near the start of the instance, in the Fel Steed stables across the main courtyard.<br /><br />I was helping a friend, and because I didn't have the quest I couldn't spot it myself we ran the entire length of the instance. We went back room by agonizing room until we reached the stables, which we didn't think to enter due to the neutral steeds in there.<br /><br />PS: those fel steeds won't attack you, but if you attack them, all three will charge you. They've been known to drop a rare <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=932">Fel Steed Saddlebag</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Whenever I go into shadowfang WoW tells me i'm not in the instance's group and tries to teleport me to ironforge. Why?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It tells you that because you don't have a reason to be there I believe. It's like when I first went into the Stockades without any quest to be in there. It said the same thing it did to you and teleported me back to Stormwind.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just soloed Jordans Smithing Hammer as a lvl 25 Draeni Pladin (Drenden Server)<br />Took me about an hour &amp; 1/2. I died about 7 times running back to pluck off mob after mob until i can safely walk up to the crate and take it.<br /><br />&quot;Sea&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>where are the fel steed stables and this instance?<br /><br />what town?<br /><br />pls help</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Azaile</b></h3>Just soloed on WoW classic, started lvl 23, lvled to 24. only took about 30 mins. Pull each group 2 at a time, kill the wolf first, then the woren. There are a few you can pull solo too so do that as possible. When you get to Rethilgores room clear the top area (all can be solo pulled) and 1 wolf at the bottom closest to the stairs. When ready, jump over the ledge infront of the middle cage, stun the boss on the way down, open the middle cage talk to the guy get him to open the gate, then run to the enterance and zone out. Zone back in go to court yard. Pull any thing in your way, most can be solo pulled bar 1 group of 2 wogen. There is 1 wogen inside the stables but you can avoid pulling him at lvl 24. claim the hammer, hearth. done.</div>
