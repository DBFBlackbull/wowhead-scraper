<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>after using this for tonight in MC/AQ, it is AMAZING!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have gotten both the backstab and feint books and to be honest not to impressed with backstab. This feint book on the other hand is pretty sweet. I've noticed i can go all out and pull agro way less. Does anyone know where i can actually see the threat reduction of the new talent i'm just curious to why this is such an improvement over the last rank.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Any rogue that thinks an upgrade in feint is not important doesn't do enough DPS. I'm combat spec'd and after my first 2-3 attacks I almost always draw aggro because of my DPS. I can't wait until I get this book.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No dought the best of the three new skills. When I first saw that new feint was coming out I was really glad. To those who question its usefulness I can only say that either they have an UBER tank, that doest loos agro ever, or they dont have adiquete gear. Also lets not forget what in several cases tank switching is needer wich some times can wast dps time, but with this little baby rogues can be allowd to keep pounding uninterupted (well in most cases). Agro control is the most importat factor in a raid, and the new Feint really helps.<br /><br />And to the guy who said that something new for pvp ... I can only say that what drops from pve should be for pve. :) plus you get deadly poison and backstab for pvp, be thankful :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How is feint useful in PvP? That I don't understand....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Too funny!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The previous rank of Fient did -600 Threat, this one does -800 Threat. That is a 25% increase! With this you have to Fient less, meaning you have more energy to Backstab/SS, meaning you do more DPS in PvE. It's pretty sweet deal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Of the 3 rogue books available in AQ20, this is pretty much the only one I really wanted; BS is ok (it's not a great upgrade though) and deadly poison I don't care about. Got Feint V last night, I'm a happy less-threatening rogue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>feint without talk has proven its worth. i'm sorry but sometimes tanks just can't keep aggro off you and its required. i hope to one day do uber dps so i'll need an uber tank by my side, or well this new feint can work nicely too. See? very nice upgrade imo. also if you've gone combat/assassination its quite common to pull aggro off of even really good tanks, so for those whos messages are &quot;Below threshold&quot; making fun of tanks of our realm its obvious that you have yet to start a rogue. good luck to you lol<br /><br />with all these misguided comments i'm just surprised no one has stepped in with HUNTERLEWT! hmmm... but of course as i open my mouth i should soon expect it :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got it for 75G on Dunemaul US! <br /><br />Auctioneer is telling me it goes for 380G normally (seen 8 times total). I got a pretty sweet deal I think :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Feint is uesless huh?<br />Try surviving in BWL (and MC to a lesser degree) without it.<br />And if you can survive without it then you are so far away from your potential dps that you should be ashamed of yourself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just got the Sacrificial Dagger the other night from the first boss in AQ20, and I can say without a doubt that I need to get Feint Rank 5...STAT! I am getting insane crits with the dagger (even on white damage), and Feint 4 just doesn't wipe enough of the threat generated by my increased damage. Since getting the dagger, I have been using my Feint every 10 seconds.<br /><br />Feint is one of the most valuable skills a rogue has...in MC and beyond, if you pull aggro, you die. Dead rogues do 0 dps...<br /><br />Edited, Fri Jun 9 10:56:58 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ambush is given a new rank every 8 levels...your last rank was given to you at level 58, why would anyone expect blizzard to release a new rank of ambush? Feint is the best spell you can learn from AQ20 hands down. With my grand marshal daggers I am pulling agro less while increasing my overall raid dps. Thanks for the upgrade! <br /><br />Edited, Thu Feb 23 14:25:49 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you only use feint on vael then you're a complete and utter newb, and judging from your gear, you're not too experienced as it is. Don't give bad advice lol, feint is the most wondrous and indispensable skill to rogues in the game as it allows us to maintain steady and extremely high damage outputs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>does anyone know where this could be found?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I guess you guys haven't discovered the beauty of feint. When I'm in a group, I use this constantly. I'm a dagger spec rogue and my ambushes/backstabs put me at the top of the threat list nearly every time. My only problem is that feint doesn't work often enough. If this book would help with that, it would be a god send. I'm sure my guilds healers would love it too as they hate when I pull the aggro from a boss and the tank has serious trouble getting it back. Just my opinion though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>AAH! i bought this for 1g! even though the patch makes it obsolete, it still vends for 10g!<br /><br />major pwnage to the FACE</div>
