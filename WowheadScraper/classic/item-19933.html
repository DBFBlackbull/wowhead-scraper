<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>50 hours is about what it's taking me. It may sound steep, but the Amulet of the Darkmoon is worth 50 hours. Better than anything you'll get off the auction house, and better than everything I've seen in non-raid instances. Even if there's an instance drop better, it's rare and you'll have to brave the need rolls to get it in the off case it actually drops. This one is just a matter of collecting enough junk, and there's plenty of options to get tehre. Farm the scorpid blood all month, buy rugged leather kits or other turnins with the rest of your income. I managed around 100 tickets a day doing this. Invest a couple weeks during the month, and then when the fair comes in, you should be set to go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I thought I'd post this here so others could avoid a headache.<br /><br />After deciding to collect scorpid blood for the amulet I learned something about the nature of sillithus. Each mob in a given region will spawn as 1 of about 3 things.<br /><br />***IMPORTANT***<br /><br />If you go around killing only scorpids, soon there will be no scorpids!<br /><br />***IMPORTANT***<br /><br />When the faire is in town on my server, with a 5:1 ration of alliance to horde, you can walk across gnomes and night elves from one end to the other without touching the sand. All of which selectively pick scorpids and race around on their mounts. Then when I clear an area of spawns they swoop in and scoop up all the scorpids and leave.<br /><br />So, maybe you don't know how the area works, now you've been warned and have no excuse.<br /><br />pick an area: kill everything, wait for scorpids. TRUST ME IT WILL BE FASTER.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Dec 7 10:11:54 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't know guys, but I easily picked up about 10 each 30-35min. Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Figured I'd try farming these things for tickets. After a straight hour of farming I ended up with 12 Glowing Scorpid Blood and a bunch of vendor trash. A 1200 ticket prize would take about 50 hours of farming at the rate I was getting the drops. Not worth it if you ask me.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Nov 3 12:05:33 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I sold about 4k of these things at Auctions.. Now that I need rep I dont have patience to farm them for myself :P<br /><br />Edited, Sat Mar 4 19:07:48 2006</div>
