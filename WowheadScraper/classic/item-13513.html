Not sure what blizzard were thinking with this, however the cost simple isnt worth it. <br /><br />Im not sure i've ever heard of another use these, i know in our guild they have never been considered.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Completely pointless, especially when magic resistance potion increases all resistances by 60 for less than 5% of the materials</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>fraction of the price yes....but it only lasts 30 seconds as opposed to the 2 hours.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No resistance buffs stack, period.&nbsp; Apparently it'd be &quot;overpowered&quot; if they did.&nbsp; Paladin aura, shaman totem, etc will override this for specific resistances.&nbsp; Hell, druid MOTW is almost better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><a href="http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/4688/11246989064nn.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/4688/11246989064nn.jpg</a><br /><br />Ragnaros Equips.&nbsp; Fire still hurts.&nbsp; Getting 300 resistance wont make you nearly invincible as stated above.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This flask is perfect for MC. THE EFFECTS OF THE FLASK LAST THROUGH DEATH. Its not worth it to buy the reagents and then make the flask to resell. if you gather the reagents and make flask 40g is a fair asking price (40g is cost of reagents). i made this flask in under 3 hours for free.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is realy stupid, u need to go find a alchemy lab to do potion when ur level 300 alch? eny way were are these labs? <br />and at what level can i go and do some potion?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm with the previous poster....where are these alchemy labs? Any help would be appreciated, as I am maxed out at 300 alchemy and would like to be able to make the flasks and such. Thanks All.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you didn't make this for free.<br /><br />You used the materials which could have gotten you lots of cash. You didn't spend gold on it, but that's entirely different to &quot;free&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So I am still not clear.&nbsp; Does this stack with GotW or shaman totems?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i can make all Flask on Stormreaver /w Overdoz =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a great potion if you use it along with a Greater Nature/ Fire/ Arcane/ Frost/ or Shadow resist potion too. That's 25 Resist to all and then Absorbing 1950 to 3250 of that particular damage. And there's also +resist gear for the added resist. I'd say you'd be doing pretty well with that. Also, for the absorb potions it's only a 2 minute cooldown on them. So once an absorb pot runs out you can just slap on another one. If you make 10 stacks you can use the absorb pots 50 times. That is either a good amount, way too much, or pretty close to enough depending on what your class is and what you're doing. Great pot if used with other pots.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>everyone has debated the worth of these potions, but no one has said where you actualy get them, since they are not drops or rewards, what vendor supplies these i am 300 alchemy and cant find anyone selling them and ah is selling at ripoff prices (although someone has said its a drop in ubrs - is this the only drop location, thottbott says its a recipe not drop or quest reward)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The problem I see about using this is instances, is most of the time, the resistances are focused on one or two major elements, (MC Fire, AQ Nature, Naxxramas...Shadow? (This post is prior to the instance's release)) so, 25 resistance is a relatively minor boost to just one resistance.&nbsp; The biggest use I see for this, is, at this point in time, PvP...what a waste, :P&nbsp; Well, because in PvP is where you'll encounter the most varied amounts of elements, so the +25 is worth something, even then, my class (Warlock) can get +60 resistance against everything with a certain build and demon out.&nbsp; If the flask was +50 or hell, even more, I could see it being well worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This effect persists through death and stacks with all other resistance spells and items.<br /><br />Read the damn item before you post how useless this is, with this flask, and only this flask you can get the single highest resistance to any school of magic in the game.<br /><br />Seems pretty useful to me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Like the previous post said, Thottbot shows where to get anything. <br /><br />There are two alchemy labs that I know of. One is in Scholo, where you kill Raswhisper or whatever (in the viewing room). The other is in BWL, Blackwing Lair. My guild goes there every week, and it is awesome to just run in there and make flasks during the 3-4 days that the instance is not reset. Beats the heck out of PUG's and all that fighting.<br /><br />These flasks do not seem to be in demand. But I bet with the expansion there will be a greater need for them, or why would Blizz create them. I gambled and bought mine. But I only paid 275 for it, not the 500-600 they try to get at AH. One good way to get expensive stuff, is to send mail to the person trying to sell it and tell them a price and ask them if they don't sell it to send it for X amount to you COD.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dont understand everyones confusion about this flask. It adds +25 resistance to all schools of magic (Arcane, Frost, Fire, Nature, and Shadow), it does NOT decrease other mobs, or targets resistance. Hence it cant be dispelled. It doesn't effect other players, only helps the player using the flask, become extra resistant to all schools of magic. (period)<br /><br />I've had this recipe for about 6 months, and I cant give these things away. I'm not to happy about that fact, I won the recipe and was very happy, it was my first flask. But its not that great. Maybe in a PvP setting, its money. But I dont PvP. And dont find much use for them. So I just made two of them and used them as book ends :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where is the best place to get this recipe besides the Ah?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Recipe is a rare drop from Rend Blackhand's dragon - Gyth - in Upper Blackrock Spire</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Theres a lab in the Horde Undercity :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there are problems with MotW though. MoTW doesnt stack with pally aura either.<br /><br />Are we positive it doesnt stack? because i got the recipe for really cheap and i dont know if im going to resell it yet</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>But I think this stacks fully.<br />Still not that overly useful, I mean, it sticks through death, so could be ace in a BG, but a bit costly for it.<br /><br />+25 is not much, and I guess the Zandalar one with 3% spellreflect chance beats it, but hey, this one isn't tooooo bad if you got the mats ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does this stack with Mark of the Wild? I know the Magic Resistance Potion does not, and was wondering about this one....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It stack with Mark of the wild :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got the recipe from UBRS last night, i have started to gater materials for some flasks, as a herbalist that isnt very difficult.<br /><br />What does it protect me from ?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have never used a flask before, is it a one time use for 2 hours or can it be used again once the 2 hrs has passed?</div>
