They belong in a woodchipper.&nbsp; Evolution left them behind.&nbsp; Yeah, these hunters are total loot monkeys.&nbsp; But seriously this argument is stronger than it looks, +crit does help hunter ranged damage as well as melee.&nbsp; All physical damage works off of a shared critical rate.&nbsp; I'm 90% sure the AP does add to Ranged attack power as well, but again I might be wrong on this.\n\n'WARRIORS = TANK, PALLIES = BUFF BOT'\n\nSurvey says: No.&nbsp; Warriors can DPS and warriors can tank.&nbsp; Like it or not, a well-geared (especially DW fury warrior) will blow hunter DPS out of the water as of 1.11.&nbsp; Yes, they will blow mages out of the water.&nbsp; Yes they will beat out rogues.&nbsp; They own everything.&nbsp; Until Fetish of the SandReaver and other threats are fixed and the DPS trinkets are nerfed this will be true.\n\nPaladins cannot do very good DPS when compared to evenly geared people.&nbsp; This is true.&nbsp; Most won't admit it, though.&nbsp; Paladins do the lowest DPS of any class besides possibly a protection warrior.&nbsp; Does this make them Buff bots?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Paladins can OT and tank very well.&nbsp; They can heal relatively well.&nbsp; They are good at filling in the cracks.&nbsp; They deserve to bid\/roll on a weapon like this because they are also a melee class.\n\n2) On to the Paladin arguments\n\n'2FAST 4 WARRIOR NUBSAUCE'\n\nYes and no.&nbsp; This weapon is pretty craptacular for an MS warrior with sword specialization, something like Demonshear is better for that.&nbsp; But a 2H fury setup benefits muchly from the +AP and +crit on this weapon.&nbsp; Further, weapon speed has absolutely no imapct on Fury PvE DPS at all.&nbsp; There are benefits to using fast and slow weapons when you're Fury.\n\n'IM DPS PALADIN'\n\nOk, I stopped laughing.&nbsp; There are no DPS paladins.&nbsp; And if there are they wouldn't be using this.&nbsp; Paladins do horrible melee DPS compared to warriors and overall way less DPS than even our buddies the hunters.&nbsp; If you're a Paladin your real claim to this is BoK and SoC.\n\n'HUNTAR DONT NEED MELEE OMGWTFBBQ'\n\nJudgment: No.&nbsp; Hunters DO need melee.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Hunters can't always stay back.&nbsp; In PvP, people tend to not stand there and just let you die.&nbsp; Furthermore in groups hunters will sometimes have to defend themselves if aggro gets loose or if there is a bad pull or if petty goes and pulls some nasties back (they tend to do that, god bless the little bastards).&nbsp; Even melee weapons can add stats\/modifiers to ranged damage.&nbsp; Hunters will probably see less overall direct usage out of this weapon, but they still benefit from it.\n\n'HUNTAR THAT MELEE DPS IS NUB LOLZ'\n\nActually, this guy has somewhat a point.&nbsp; Most hunter DPS comes from traps, pet and ranged attacks.&nbsp; If the hunter is trying to melee DPS as a primary damage outlet and\/or tank, then he is a noob.&nbsp; Tap the idiot on the shoulder and remind him he has leather armor.&nbsp; But by the same token, a good tank shouldn't lose aggro to a hunter's raptor strike at melee.\n\nBut what are you talking about anyways?&nbsp; You're a Paladin, you do crap DPS.\n\n3) Finally, the warrior arguments\n\n'ME FURY SPEC ME HULKSMASH ME DPS ME NOT TANK'\n\nNo, in a group you're the tank regardless of what your spec is.&nbsp; That is your role, it's what the warrior class does best.&nbsp; Like it or not, it is your role unless there is another warrior handy.&nbsp; You are going to do more dps DIRECTLY with this weapon than a hunter or a pally, but they still benefit from the adds.\n\n'I'll get the most use out of it'\n\nProbably true, but why should people in a pug be selfless for you?&nbsp; The whole point of pugs is to lootmonkey and farm for your own self-interest.&nbsp; I mean really poor kids in Africa could use your WoW money better than you.&nbsp; You selfish prick!&nbsp; Get the point?\n\nYou can't expect people you don't know to help you for no reason.&nbsp; The only case I can think of where this works is if you need it as a sincere upgrade and the hunters don't.&nbsp; \n\n'2H = MINE'\n\nNo.&nbsp; If this were the case Hunters would be restricted to dual-wield and Paladins would be sword-board.&nbsp; But they aren't.&nbsp; There is more than one reason to use a 2hand weapon. Chances are you noobcakes bid on 1hand weapons too because 'OMGZPWN ME DW FURY DPS TOOZ'.&nbsp; Get over yourself, you don't have a monopoly on DPS.&nbsp; Rogues, hunters and even paladins should be able to bid on 1hand stuff.\n\n'PALLY=HEALBOT#2 HUNTER = MA-BOT\/PULLBOT'\n\nIf you're the tank, you should almost always be pulling unless the Hunter is going to feign death or that's one dead hunter.&nbsp; Paladins don't exist to heal you, priests\/resto druids do.&nbsp; You sir, deserve to be fed feet-first through a garbage disposal unit, have a nice day.\n\nTo summarize:\n \nIt isn't a warrior weapon.&nbsp; It isn't a paladin weapon.&nbsp; It isn't a hunter weapon.\n\nIT'S A WEAPON.\n\nEvery one of these classes benefit from the stats on it.&nbsp; In a pug, you can't expect people to go off whats best for a group because the group is probably a one-time thing.&nbsp; You cannot expect charity from strangers.&nbsp; You are owed nothing, you own nothing.&nbsp; You are not DPS, you are a class.&nbsp; It's data on an online game, get the hell over it.","date":"2006-08-15T17:30:23-05:00","rating":12,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"whoblitzell","importedSubject":"You're all a bunch of ninnies"},{"commentv2":1,"number":25,"id":2712302,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I�ve alwais wanted this sword - sadly my realm isn't much up to DiM North, only lock\/pala epic quests in West or whatever.\n\nI totally disagree with the above poster btw.\nYou're maybe right - hunters could be more useful, and have higher dps too.\nAnd in TBC we'll finally become more powerful as far as i read about the new talents\/spells.\nBut we�re NOT only made for kiting Drakki. >_<\n\nHmf.","date":"2006-10-27T17:30:23-05:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"bilsteimz","importedSubject":"Hmm =\/"},{"commentv2":1,"number":26,"id":2712314,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I dinged 69 on my hunter last night, and finally banked my trusty Barbarous Blade which I got way back in the day, and swapped it for a Crystalforged War Axe with +25 Agility. \n\nWhat took me so long?

This blade with its relatively quick 2-hander speed (3.2) didn't get the umph in instant attacks.  Now that all two -handers are made to be multiplied by a standard speed (3.3) they are dead-on even in the instant attack bonuses from attack power.  The only difference is the average damage per swing which the instants start with.  The difference between these two being 32 damage.  Thats how much more AR does than barbarous each instant swing. That and the 2 extra AP.  However, this baby has the +1% chance to crit.  And with my damage as an arms spec'd warrior... that more than compensates for 32 extra damage for each instant attack ability.  That's because the extra 1% affects all attacks. \n\nJust my two cents.\n\n-Aztek\n\n\nEdited, Tue Sep 27 08:21:59 2005","date":"2005-09-27T12:03:19-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Well let me remind you that you get 5% crit with axe spec and AR, So i wouldent excatly say its crap now, Just less viable.

Those stats beat the bone slicing hatchets easilly, not even taking into account the fact that this is easier to obtain (since blizz made Baron only 5 man) and gives you huge raptor strikes (you gotta do it sometime) Also, one +15 agility enchant goes for 90g on my server, I dont know about yours, as apposed to a +25 agility at 120g.

I'm a hunter and now with the expansion and patch I am about to vendor my 2 Bone Slicing Hatchets as I just put the +25 agility enchant on this bad boy.<br /><br />DM is a fantastically fun instance to do...run it to get all kinds of mail goodies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6888</b></h3>The axes from Strat UD are possibly better since you gain 2crit and more ap. You can use this/switch to this though for Raptor strike damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tsarnkoth</b></h3>Now that hunters get less AP from agility, this sword is actually even better for them than it was, compared to combos like the 2 BSH's mentioned. I believe it adds 14 to your Crit Rating under the new system and a straight 60 AP, which used to be the same as 30 agility but is now equal to 60 agility... hunter class changes in the new patch/TBC make this a very nice hunter weapon.<br /><br />As a warrior, I still think it's just as good for us, but I try not to be ignorant of what other classes might get good use out of it. I'd say Pallies should get Bonecrusher, the quest item linked above, as they haven't had their Str to AP changed the way Hunters have had Agi nerfed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;Warriors need high damage output and this weapon certainly ISNT one of the best.&nbsp; Just go get Blackhand Doomsaw, much better for warriors. &quot;<br /><br />Funny, since a lot of Hunters seem to roll on my Doomsaw claiming that it is a Hunter polearm. <br /><br />I'll be rolling on this if i was a paladin or a warrior, I can guarantee you that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Warriors &amp; Retrib Pallies, you can forget about the Barbarous Blade AND BE HAPPY!&nbsp; <br /><br />The *Bonecrusher* has basically the same benefit to you, and it ISN'T desired by hunters!<br /><br />Bonecrusher has 53.8 DPS, +30 Strength, and +1 to crit.&nbsp; +30 Strength equates to +60 Attack Power, making Bonecrusher almost identical to the Barbarous Blade.&nbsp; The slight difference of 0.2 speed is all that really seperates the two weapons.<br /><br />And here's the best part:<br /><br />Bonecrusher is a quest reward... guaranteed, no worries over it dropping!<br /><br />And there was much rejoicing!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a lvl 60 hunter.<br /><br />The problem is that some hunters roll on everything that has high dps!<br /><br />The thing that makes this weapon great for Hunter is:<br />+60 attackpower (60/12= 5 DPS boost on ranged attack..)<br />+1% crits (we all like that and this also boost the ranged crit)<br />really good dps too (yes, we need melee too)<br /><br />After beeing lvl 60 for months you are only satisfied with the best! Barabarous Blade IS the best Hunter 2h, Blackhand doomsaw is the best warrior 2h. (i'm not counting epic stuff here)<br /><br />So if you are after the doomsaw, don't roll on this before a hunter, because he will end his search for a 2h after getting this! <br /><br />And also ignore all hunters with 2h's without agi/stam/attackpower, they are ruining other hunters chance to get the weapons they should have, by rolling on things like the doomsaw!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a warrior who has this sword, but if there would have been a hunter in the group when this dropped I'd definately give them first dibs.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a great weapon and I'm happy to have it, but i'd love it even more on my hunter :D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm not even getting into the hunter/warr argument... it's a hunter weapon first, warr weapon second.&nbsp; Warriors need to go 1h/shield or use one of the bluezillion better weapons available to them.&nbsp; Not going into that...<br /><br />That being said, I don't believe this 2hander is asuseful for hunters as other weapons.&nbsp; Hunters should farm for this weapon because it's easy to get, mostly.&nbsp; Crit % is majorly important for hunters because of their DPS status.&nbsp; So if you're wondering, &quot;what would be the best weapon set for my hunter,&quot; the answer is to go with either dawn's edge x2 or dal'rend/dawn.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hunters do tank, despite what others say.&nbsp; For those of you who get stunned by warriors in PvP you all know what I mean.&nbsp; The idea of a 2h weapon is that it has much less of a chance of missing a wingclip than dual-wielding, so a hunter uses range til the enemy closes, uses wing clip almost guaranteed to hit, runs off, and shoots some more.<br /><br />But quite frankly, if a hunter misses wing clip on his first attempt, he'll most likely get it on the 2nd dual wielding.&nbsp; While Barbarous Blade offers 1% crit and a possible +15 agi enchant, dual wielding crit axes offers a possible 2% crit and +30 agi, meaning you'll have a much larger damage increase at range, which is what you should be doing 94% of the time.<br /><br />Dal'rend only drops around 10%, and Dawn's Edge with +15 agi enchants takes some rediculously expensive mats.&nbsp; My advice?&nbsp; Get the blade and use it until you can afford to dual wield crit axes.<br /><br />Stop being afraid of hunters.&nbsp; We're not your enemy.&nbsp; The horde/alliance member ganking you in PvP with his epic armor because he didn't spend time flaming on thottbot is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have a question. that king gordok. is he in the west side or what? and another question. can anyone please post a picture with a character wielding it ? thanks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just my two cents, I'm a 60 Warrior and got this over the weekend.&nbsp; I would have definitely passed on it if a hunter were in the group but there wasn't.&nbsp; Something a lot of people seem to have overlooked is that more warriors are sword specced than mace or polearm (for those offering up alternatives such as Bonecrusher and the Doomsaw) since mace spec is kinda useless and polearm spec is a 25pt talent instead of 20pt (thus requiring points in talents that are less desirable), and most tanks use 1h swords, so this a highly desirable 2h for tanks when PVP/soloing (we don't spend all our time tanking after all).&nbsp; This is also a very nice looking sword!<br /><br />However as I said I'd have passed on it to a hunter as it is beneficial to them unconditionally, and any warriors or especially pallies (due to a lack of weapon spec) who outroll a hunter on this clearly do not have a good grasp of how +AP works (or just want a badass looking sword).<br /><br />However the fact is that everyone in your group deserves to roll on the gear they feel would benefit their character - so as they say, let the dice decide and good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>is my server (Eredar) just weird, 'cuz i've never been on a Tribute run where anyone other than a hunter wanted this sword - i got mine a week or so ago, and the warrior and pally i was with were surprised when i said i was going for it, they expected they'd have to DE it (like usual).<br /><br />imho, it's generally seen as a hunter weapon because the only stat on it that hunters don't really use, the melee DPS, is kinda low. Warrior's and paladins are generally going for a 2H that's slower and higher DPS. That makes this a flawed weapon for them (good if they don't have better already only), but still leaves it great for hunters.<br /><br />i continue to think that most of the debate in thottbot threads is between people who aren't high enough level or haven't seen enough of the game to know how good the item is in relation to other items they may already have at this level.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whether the weapon is 2h or not is <i>irrelevant</i>--it's the stats, the dps and the speed of the weapon.&nbsp; Obviously hunters with no instant melee strikes based off melee weapon damage are going to disregard weapon speed, while warriors will want the slowest weapon possible for hardest instant strike hits and biggest crits.<br /><br />The fact that this weapon has +60 attack power (melee and ranged) and 1% crit (which is equivalent to 53 agility to hunters, versus the 20 agility for 1% crit on warriors) makes it obviously ideal for hunters.<br /><br />No warrior half-decent warrior is going to want this 3.2 speed weapon, attacks too slow--mortal strike and overpower would be hitting for so little compared to the Ice Barbed Spear or Unstoppable Force.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> And did you just say pallys are unbalanced in melee fighting versus a warrior--and then demand warriors get holy shield and nerf paladins to using staves for game balance?<br /><br />That's just plain unintelligent--you clearly do not know how to play a warrior correctly if you,<br /><br />A) Think warriors should use 2h like this one (instead of, for example, a hunter using it)<br /><br />or<br /><br />B) Think pally's are overpowered in melee combat--specifically when being compared to warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>its a hunter wpn warriors get blackhand doomsaw pallies go kill yourselves,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Barbarous Blade is the *PERFECT* weapon for the hunter epic quest to get Rhok'Delar BECAUSE of the speed. On one of the 60 elites you have to face, you will need to melee for almost or exactly 10 seconds, so what do you do? Keep a timer beside you, looking at it every few seconds? NO! You go to DM, get BB, and when you have to melee the boss, you do this: Run in, hit twice, count to 1, wing clip, and the 3rd hit will almost always come when you are strafing away from him. The only thing I would replace this weapon for are 2 Bone Slicing Hatchets or Barb of the Sand Reaver. Besides, there are so many better other swords/maces/axes in the game geared towards a non-hunter class. Just let us have a few melee weapons that you are only rolling on b/c you want another bank space filled up, or another 3g in your pocket, or to DE.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>at the end of the day warriors/pallis will give this to a hunter bcoz they no if doomsaw drops they wont get it if they won this blade its all about if its a better wep than what u got guys</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stonebull (60 hunter in Demoic Souls on Draenor) - this droped for me 2 weeks ago on my second tribute run, and as the warrior in our group already had an epic 2h, i got it without a fight. Its a great hunter weapon. With the +25 agi enchant this gives +110 ranged attack power and around 2% crit chance. The dps is also great for when hunters inevitably have to melee (its a myth that we never use our melee weapon). <br /><br />However, looking at some of the available 1h weapons out there it might not be the best available weapon set up. Duel weilding Bone Slicing Hatchets (strat UD side drop) with +15 agi on both gives +56 agi. This is a similar crit chance to the barb blade (think slightly lower, but not much) and +112 ranged attack power. Not a masisve difference to a beast or marks hunter, but survival hinters will get +15% agi on top of this, making the dual weild build the optimum choice.<br /><br />Considering the amount of great equipment in DM north for hunters, this blade is worth aiming for. If it never drops, u shuold at least get something as good for another equip slot. Not to mention DM tribute is a great run. If uve never doneone ur missing out on one of the most unique Instnace experiances.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>HUNTERS! This is a weapon that is worth rolling on. Trust me. It IS the only thing better than 2 Bone Slicing Hatchets if you are NOT survival specced.<br /><br />And even as survival, im not 100% sure.<br /><br />This is a great weapon, but PLEASE do not put Icy Weapon on it. +25 Agility for god's sake.<br /><br />(I've seen alot of hunters with Icy on that weapon.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All of the arguments on here suck.<br /><br />1)Let's listen to the Hunter arguments:<br /><br />'ZOMG HUNTAR WAEPONZ ROFLCOPTERS'<br /><br />Yeah, these hunters are greedy, annoying,inept moronic neanderthals.&nbsp; They belong in a woodchipper.&nbsp; Evolution left them behind.&nbsp; Yeah, these hunters are total loot monkeys.&nbsp; But seriously this argument is stronger than it looks, +crit does help hunter ranged damage as well as melee.&nbsp; All physical damage works off of a shared critical rate.&nbsp; I'm 90% sure the AP does add to Ranged attack power as well, but again I might be wrong on this.<br /><br />'WARRIORS = TANK, PALLIES = BUFF BOT'<br /><br />Survey says: No.&nbsp; Warriors can DPS and warriors can tank.&nbsp; Like it or not, a well-geared (especially DW fury warrior) will blow hunter DPS out of the water as of 1.11.&nbsp; Yes, they will blow mages out of the water.&nbsp; Yes they will beat out rogues.&nbsp; They own everything.&nbsp; Until Fetish of the SandReaver and other threats are fixed and the DPS trinkets are nerfed this will be true.<br /><br />Paladins cannot do very good DPS when compared to evenly geared people.&nbsp; This is true.&nbsp; Most won't admit it, though.&nbsp; Paladins do the lowest DPS of any class besides possibly a protection warrior.&nbsp; Does this make them Buff bots?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Paladins can OT and tank very well.&nbsp; They can heal relatively well.&nbsp; They are good at filling in the cracks.&nbsp; They deserve to bid/roll on a weapon like this because they are also a melee class.<br /><br />2) On to the Paladin arguments<br /><br />'2FAST 4 WARRIOR NUBSAUCE'<br /><br />Yes and no.&nbsp; This weapon is pretty craptacular for an MS warrior with sword specialization, something like Demonshear is better for that.&nbsp; But a 2H fury setup benefits muchly from the +AP and +crit on this weapon.&nbsp; Further, weapon speed has absolutely no imapct on Fury PvE DPS at all.&nbsp; There are benefits to using fast and slow weapons when you're Fury.<br /><br />'IM DPS PALADIN'<br /><br />Ok, I stopped laughing.&nbsp; There are no DPS paladins.&nbsp; And if there are they wouldn't be using this.&nbsp; Paladins do horrible melee DPS compared to warriors and overall way less DPS than even our buddies the hunters.&nbsp; If you're a Paladin your real claim to this is BoK and SoC.<br /><br />'HUNTAR DONT NEED MELEE OMGWTFBBQ'<br /><br />Judgment: No.&nbsp; Hunters DO need melee.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Hunters can't always stay back.&nbsp; In PvP, people tend to not stand there and just let you die.&nbsp; Furthermore in groups hunters will sometimes have to defend themselves if aggro gets loose or if there is a bad pull or if petty goes and pulls some nasties back (they tend to do that, god bless the little bastards).&nbsp; Even melee weapons can add stats/modifiers to ranged damage.&nbsp; Hunters will probably see less overall direct usage out of this weapon, but they still benefit from it.<br /><br />'HUNTAR THAT MELEE DPS IS NUB LOLZ'<br /><br />Actually, this guy has somewhat a point.&nbsp; Most hunter DPS comes from traps, pet and ranged attacks.&nbsp; If the hunter is trying to melee DPS as a primary damage outlet and/or tank, then he is a noob.&nbsp; Tap the idiot on the shoulder and remind him he has leather armor.&nbsp; But by the same token, a good tank shouldn't lose aggro to a hunter's raptor strike at melee.<br /><br />But what are you talking about anyways?&nbsp; You're a Paladin, you do crap DPS.<br /><br />3) Finally, the warrior arguments<br /><br />'ME FURY SPEC ME HULKSMASH ME DPS ME NOT TANK'<br /><br />No, in a group you're the tank regardless of what your spec is.&nbsp; That is your role, it's what the warrior class does best.&nbsp; Like it or not, it is your role unless there is another warrior handy.&nbsp; You are going to do more dps DIRECTLY with this weapon than a hunter or a pally, but they still benefit from the adds.<br /><br />'I'll get the most use out of it'<br /><br />Probably true, but why should people in a pug be selfless for you?&nbsp; The whole point of pugs is to lootmonkey and farm for your own self-interest.&nbsp; I mean really poor kids in Africa could use your WoW money better than you.&nbsp; You selfish prick!&nbsp; Get the point?<br /><br />You can't expect people you don't know to help you for no reason.&nbsp; The only case I can think of where this works is if you need it as a sincere upgrade and the hunters don't.&nbsp; <br /><br />'2H = MINE'<br /><br />No.&nbsp; If this were the case Hunters would be restricted to dual-wield and Paladins would be sword-board.&nbsp; But they aren't.&nbsp; There is more than one reason to use a 2hand weapon. Chances are you noobcakes bid on 1hand weapons too because 'OMGZPWN ME DW FURY DPS TOOZ'.&nbsp; Get over yourself, you don't have a monopoly on DPS.&nbsp; Rogues, hunters and even paladins should be able to bid on 1hand stuff.<br /><br />'PALLY=HEALBOT#2 HUNTER = MA-BOT/PULLBOT'<br /><br />If you're the tank, you should almost always be pulling unless the Hunter is going to feign death or that's one dead hunter.&nbsp; Paladins don't exist to heal you, priests/resto druids do.&nbsp; You sir, deserve to be fed feet-first through a garbage disposal unit, have a nice day.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />It isn't a warrior weapon.&nbsp; It isn't a paladin weapon.&nbsp; It isn't a hunter weapon.<br /><br />IT'S A WEAPON.<br /><br />Every one of these classes benefit from the stats on it.&nbsp; In a pug, you can't expect people to go off whats best for a group because the group is probably a one-time thing.&nbsp; You cannot expect charity from strangers.&nbsp; You are owed nothing, you own nothing.&nbsp; You are not DPS, you are a class.&nbsp; It's data on an online game, get the hell over it.</div>

Simply that with the +25 Agi enchant I had on the Barbarous Blade there was nothing better available to me; Terrok's Quill is nice but I wan't spending money enchanting it when I already had this.<br /><br />This is one of the few &quot;old school&quot; blues it's actually still worth getting post-expansion.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Great sword for sword-spec Arms/Fury warriors. The +AP and +crit, plus the damage, make it a decent equivalent to an Arc Reaper in my opinion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With the new modifications in the next patch to instant attack abiltiies:<br /><br />(<a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&amp;t=4981387&amp;tmp=1#post4981387" rel="nofollow">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&amp;t=4981387&amp;tmp=1#post4981387</a>)<br /><br />I would wager to say that the increased damage done by this weapon vs. the more greatly decreased damage done by the reaper... that this weapon falls somewhere between dead on even to superior to the Arcanite Reaper for a Warrior or other class with instant attack abilities.<br /><br />The reasoning is that the added damage for having a slow weapon speed (3.9 for AR) multiplied by your attack power (for a 60 warrior is considerable) is what really made the AR shine. This blade with its relatively quick 2-hander speed (3.2) didn't get the umph in instant attacks. Now that all two -handers are made to be multiplied by a standard speed (3.3) they are dead-on even in the instant attack bonuses from attack power. The only difference is the average damage per swing which the instants start with. The difference between these two being 32 damage. Thats how much more AR does than barbarous each instant swing. That and the 2 extra AP. However, this baby has the +1% chance to crit. And with my damage as an arms spec'd warrior... that more than compensates for 32 extra damage for each instant attack ability. That's because the extra 1% affects all attacks. <br /><br />Just my two cents.<br /><br />-Aztek<br /><br />Edited, Tue Sep 27 08:21:59 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think it's equally for Hunters and DPS warriors. Hunters, though, don't need the critical chance if they are going to stay ranged. The only reason the would need the crit and atk power is if 1) the atk power also applies to ranged or 2) they run out of arrows or just hate to use them. Warriors, however, will get great results from the crit and atk power adds in PvP and somewhat in PvE. This is my opinion and my opinion only.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I like this weapon but c'mon guys, hunters are chicken little noobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Lev 58 Tauren Hunter MM spec - Dath Re'mar.<br /><br />Barbarous Blade with Crusader. End of story. Thought about slapping Savagery on there, and still might do it, if I can get cheap mats.<br /><br />Currently DW Hanzo's with Firey for the past 8 levs. Got'em both for 50g - can't complain. Will miss carving up casters at melee range, but Barbarous Blade is next on the list to get to 60.<br /><br />To hell with that +15 agility enchant idea above! What a waste! I can get a pendant to do that! And slap more agility enchants on other gear too. I reckon Swords are about dishing out DPS, or in Crusader's case healing, but not pumping up a range stat. That just defies basic D&amp;D logic. What would Tolkien think?<br /><br />To any Rogue/Warrior out there who thinks 'their' class deserves BB more than a Hunter - yeah, right! Warriors couldn't do up their shoelaces unless someone else in their 'group' did it for them. And as for 'Rogues' - well from my experience they're all wannabe tanks anyway, who fight like cowards and always need to rez first on raids! Perhaps Blizzard will allow tailors to make you guys some Ugg boots one day. :)!<br /><br />Barbarous Blade's destiny lies in a Hunters hand!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With the +25 agility enchant for 2-handers, this is now VERY close to the Dal'Rends set with dual +15 agi, for hunters. The Dal'Rends still squeaks ahead, with something like 0.1% more crit chance; attack power works out to be equal, though. Unless your UBRS group's rogues already have their Dal'Rends (or better), you'd probably be better off going for this. And the BB beats dual BSHs, hands down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have both. And as a hunter, i believe that is best<br />i use the spear in pvp, nad the BB w/ a +15 agi enchant in PVE. as far as all around weapon, the IBS would be better as an all around weapon with the nice +sta and +agi stats.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunters need to really stop jizzing over agility because half of us don't even know what agility DOES. Agility for a hunter is ranged attack power and crit chance. We all should know that one Agility = 2 ranged attack power. So therefor this weapon, basically has 30 agility worth of attack power on it w/o any enchants. Also, it has 1 crit chance to boot, another stat gained from agility. Those stats beat the bone slicing hatchets easilly, not even taking into account the fact that this is easier to obtain (since blizz made Baron only 5 man) and gives you huge raptor strikes (you gotta do it sometime) Also, one +15 agility enchant goes for 90g on my server, I dont know about yours, as apposed to a +25 agility at 120g. Alot easier to obtain and alot cheaper. And even if you think this is ugly, it cannot be uglier than the Bone Slicing Hatchets.<br /><br />Better stats<br />Cheaper<br />Easier to obtain<br />Two handers make better for a hunter (If you stay in melee long enough to use both 1 handers your not playing your hunter right)<br />Better looking (Cause come on, hunter gear is fugly!)<br /><br />And BTW I have nothing against warriors who want this weapon. Hunters need to shut up. God forbid you have to roll against someone, we are one of the most gear specialized classes in WoW (Pretty much hunter mail is hunter mail and ranged items weapons are ours)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 17th 2006 at 5:42am EDT by thedoodabides</i></div>
