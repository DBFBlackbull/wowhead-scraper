<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where the heck do you get this thing in Gnomeregan? I got a white card and fed it into some machine and it gave me a security error, then I fed it into some other machine and I got an option to get a &quot;higher access level card&quot; but it didn't do anything. Is it a drop? Do I just have to kill more to find it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can I dump all four cards once I get the prismatic one?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To complete the quest you must pick up the White punch card from a random drop before the entrance to the instance and use it in the machine near Techbot.&nbsp; At the &quot;A machine&quot; be sure to pick up the next security level card, the blue card, which will be used for the &quot;B machine&quot; inside the instance, and repeat the process until you find the &quot;D machine&quot; to obtain the prismatic punch card.&nbsp; Once you get a higher level card, the lower level cards are useless, can't be sold or given away, so destroy them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You have to go in the second entrance (north of Techbot).&nbsp; You need the special key (or you can go in while in ghost form), the machine for 3005-D is in the room with the elevator.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, here is how to get it...<br /><br />When you first enter Gnomeregan, go in through the back entrance to the instance (you need to have the workshop key to open the door).&nbsp; To get there once you go down the main gold elevator, continue north to the other end of the round room (do not go west, because that will just take you into the main instance entrance).<br /><br />Once you are in, head down the long hallway, and you will eventually come to the workshop door.&nbsp; Open the door, and go straight until you come to an elevator overlooking a large round area.&nbsp; Go down the elevator.&nbsp; In the center of the round area, there is a huge round structure.&nbsp; Walk around the structure wall to the side opposite that of the elevator.&nbsp; There is a punch card machine on the wall for prismatic pumch card.<br /><br />The end.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, I got all the punchy cards, all the way up to prismatic. Following these on directions from thottbot and looking all over gnomer, I couldn't find a thing I could use Prismatic punch card that punch card for, no machine or anything. And since the first card didn't say anything about beginning a quest if you click on it, I assume the horde can't do a thing with it.<br /><br />Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm positive this punch card thing is useless on the horde side. Any horde find anything you could use it for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If I remember correct(done this quite loooong ago), prismatic card could be used to get the engineering recipe for Discombubolator ray or w/e it is (that turns the target ina lepper gnome and slows their cast/swing timers.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First off I will quote &quot;engiwar&quot; from above. <br />&quot;The prismatic punch card is for allience quest only&quot; To get it yes you must check red punch card in at machine(d) for whomever wishes to have it. <br />I am a regular to the gnome scene so These are the facts.<br /><br />1.white punch card drops before the two portals, whever really just keep kickin them around.<br />2.take that card to machine(a) which you can't miss 10-15min into gnome. and get yellow card.<br />3.take yellow P card to machine(b) which you will find 20-30 minutes after receiving yellow card, and receive blue.<br />4.take blue card to machine(c) which is located at on a small upper platform with a mini boss called somthing 6000 w/e(spider machine thing). You'll find this another 25-35min in, and receive red card. <br />5.Take red card to the bottom floor of the engineering labs to machine(d) and receive prismatic P card. In the arch way leading towards thermaplugg theirs 2 punch-o-matic(d) on each side. Their is an elevator on the top floor of the Eng. labs leading to bottom floor btw, so don't listen to the brilliant team member that says &quot;lets jump&quot;.<br /><br />Now if any hordes could loan me their knowlwdge...<br />I've been reading about these cards getting engineering schematics everywhere and all the posts on diff. sites give different info. I need a horde engineer who has actually got schematics from gnome with these cards. I have all 3 cards and the security access data card. from what I have read these items can some how retrive me discombobulator scem, and recombobultor scem lol somthin like those if you got them you'd know. anyway where can I get these? I need facts!plz! where to turn them in and what i can get because i also heard of other schematics connected to these cards idk.
