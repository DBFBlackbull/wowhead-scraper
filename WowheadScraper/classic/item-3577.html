People cannot even sell 10 gold bars for 1 gold piece at the AH.<br /><br />Secondly, the whole server is flooded with Alchemists, who spam the ridiculous &quot;Transmute Iron to Gold&quot; recipee, thereby flooding the market with gold bars even more. Soon, iron bars will be more expensive than gold bars!<br /><br />Two-and-a-half days of running around Badlands and Tanaris, have given me 118 gold bars, which I quite frankly, don't know what to do with. I cannot sell them because nobody buys them, and I cannot even use them to manufacture something, since gold alone cannot be used to make anything. The abudance of gold veins to mine is also very annoying. Where Iron or Mithril ought to have spawned, I see annoying, useless gold veins popping up, over and over again.<br /><br />-----------&gt;Profit wise, the only item that can give the Smith a miniscule profit when sold to vendors, as well as the best material-to-profit ratio, is I think the Golden Scale Leggings <a href="http://www.thottbott.com/?i=3485" rel="nofollow">http://www.thottbott.com/?i=3485</a>. Since I feel it is a shame to just vendor off all those useless gold bars, I will make as many of those Leggings as possibe. Needless to say, I have got dozens of equally useless, iron bars. Wherever you go, you bump on an Iron or Gold vein in this game.<br /><br />------------&gt;In case somebody from Bliz reads this, a good idea would be discontinuing the &quot;Transmute Iron to Gold&quot; recipee, or making it a lot more difficult to perform. That would finally give some value to our dozens of useless gold bars.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Me and another player (both fairly new to WoW) thought this would be a good money making scheme, he mines and smelts the iron and i transmute then A/H the stacks and stacks of gold! Muhahahahaa. 24h cooldown! it sucks bigtime. we should have researched it...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just done the same as the above, what a wast of time and gold... I should have saved my money to buy a mount</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>how much is 1 Gold bar worth each to any vendor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ya thats what i said dont want to reapeat yes it is important to me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>gold bars sell 4 6s each to vendors which sucks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a Jemcrafter in the Gnomer server, and I need iron to gold xmutes. My name is Orag, so if there r any alchemists on that server that can do the iron-gold xmute, send me a letter and I will keep a permanent copy of it, and u can do them for me. Im paying 1g per x-mute.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well i am rich from the old patches from when gold sold fpr 1g each i got about 421 gold a day so i got about 500 gold from ah but now it dont sell for much iron is better</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yup :E</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I noticed this too a few days ago. Even just 2 weeks ago, 1 gold bar was selling for 1 gold piece. I picked up 20 gold bars for 4 gold 2 days ago.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Price seems to have gone up on my server. I think because it can be used in a tailor patten used in an AD quest. Which is why I'm after Gold Bars atm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Has anyone else noticed that the price on stacks of Gold Bars in the AH has dropped significantly recently? A few months ago I could sell stacks of 20 Gold Bars (that I transmuted from Iron Bars as an Alchemist) for 8 to 10 gold pieces without a problem. Now I notice that stacks of 20 are selling for only 4 gold pieces each. What's up? Are there more people making them? Are they dropped more often? Are there fewer recipes that they are needed for?<br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 11th 2006 at 12:43pm PDT by nastymage</i></div>

In the context of WoW Classic, they are valuable for crafting and trading, with a maximum stack of 20 and a sell price of 6.&quot;<br /><br />Feel free to adjust based on the specific context or focus you want to highlight!<br />Visit website www,goldrate.qa</div>
