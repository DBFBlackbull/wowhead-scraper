<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7786</b></h3>Another good place to farm these is in Stranglethorn Vail. The Naga there (on the coast directly to the West of Booty Bay) regularly drop clam shells - most of which contain Tangy Clam Meat. I've found that when farming with a level 60, a golden pearl will drop about once an hour here. Doesn't sound very appetizing, but you'll often pick up black and iridescent pearls in the mix.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9407</b></h3>Good place to farm them is the turtles in Tanaris on the southern peninsula. Probably 50-75 spawns out there that people don't go for much. (If you don't know where I mean, I'm talking about the furthest southern peninsula far past the pirates almost due south of the Hazzali Hive past the mountains.<br /><br />The turtles are easy to kill, and drop likes of the speckled fragments that sell pretty well. I have to suggest that if you farm for a while, dont pick up the turtle meat or the tails that they drop, those don't sell well. Just fill your pack full of the speckled fragments and loot the clams looking for pearls.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vibriss</b></h3><b>DISCLAIMER</b>: If you have the option to buy the pearls somewhere, strongly consider it before going to farm them. This item has a frustratingly low drop rate that will seriously test your sanity. It's completely random. The drop rate doesn't aggregate as you open the clams. It's like rolling a 200-sided die every time you open a clam and hoping from one specific number. The drop rate listed here is also misleading. You will probably not get 4 Black Pearls in 100 clams. You are not guaranteed to get a Golden Pearl in 200 clams. This method can lead to frustrating chains of empty (of pearls) clams, but you also may get 2 in your first 2 clams. It's rough. Don't do that to yourself.<br /><br /><b>The location to farm:</b> <i>Ravencrest Monument</i> in <b>Azshara. </b> It's the south-eastern ridge overlooking Duke Hydraxis.<br /><br /><ul><li>It has got plenty of naga to kill and there is virtually no downtime. Kill everything on the U-shaped ridge and then go lap back around, the naga will have respawned by then.</li><li>There is no competition. This area is very isolated. Even herbalists and miners don't go there often, and everyon else has no business to be there.</li><li>There is a vendor not too far - <a href="/classic/npc=8678/jubie-gadgetspring">Jubie Gadgetspring</a> - where you can unload the stuff you get if you commit to farming.</li></ul><br /><br />I was looking for 2 Golden Pearls for my Spell Power weapon enchant. There were only a handful on the AH and they went for around 160g each - the money I didn't have - so I went grinding. It took me around <b>9 hours</b> time to get both. The second pearl dropped on my <b>608</b> clam.<br /><br />Over the course of this insanity I got a 15 Iridescent, 13 Black and 10 Small Lustruous pearls as well a blue BoE <a href="/classic/item=1607/soulkeeper">Soulkeeper</a>, 2 <a href="/classic/item=4500/travelers-backpack">Traveler's Backpack</a> and made around 160 raw gold from looting and vendoring.<br /><br />It wasn't too bad all things considered, but I don't think I would've done it if I could afford the pearls off the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lachaz</b></h3>Farm the turtles at Steamwheedle in Tanaris, do it until you have 10-15 clams then open them all, i usually get a pearl about every 25-30, sometimes it drops black pearls too.</div>
