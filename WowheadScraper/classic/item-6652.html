<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mushalor</b></h3>To find the cultists:<br /><br />From Razor Hill go north out of the camp. Immediately past the last building in camp, hang a right off the road and follow the curve of the ravine around. There's a path that leads up to top of the ravine (53, 38). Continue north--you'll run directly to the mouth of a cave. Yes, there are mobs there hanging around the front of the cave that -aren't- cultists.<br />Don't fret!<br />I thought I was in the wrong area too. They're inside the cave, to the left when following the path. First cultist dropped it for me.<br />(Incidentally, don't be like me and spend an hour in the cave near Orgrimmar. You'll end up scratching your head and wondering why none of the mobs in there are cultists. :3 )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The coords are right, but BE SURE your minimap says Durator &lt;sp&gt; above it or they will be wrong and put you by a bunch of wisp looking things.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took me forever to find these guys.&nbsp; The key is to go due east out of Razor hill, and then immediately turn north.&nbsp; Do not go into the ravine.&nbsp; Do not take the trail north to orc city.&nbsp; You have to stay up above the ravine, and you will see the cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, I wasted a lot of time at the wrong cave.&nbsp; You do not go into skull cave which has a different type of Burning Blade people - it is the wrong place - way too far north.<br /><br />As mentioned, you have to find the ramp right outside of Razor Hill, it is immediately north east of the town.&nbsp; The ramp takes you up onto the top of the ravines, over looking the road that goes north out of razor hill.&nbsp; On top of these ravines is where the cave you need to go to.&nbsp; The map listed here is correct, but what it fails to show you is that there are two levels of terrain, the ravine/road level and the above level where you are actually up on the cliffs which look down on the ravine/road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, the map of Durotar in the commercial strategy guide doesn't show this cave nor does it list the correct burning blade people.&nbsp; The only burning blade people it lists are the ones from skull cave.<br /><br />Hope that helps, I wasted an hour fighting in skull cave and 2 hours running around on that spot on the map not realizing that you could get up on the ravine faces.&nbsp; This is especially difficult for Taurens who aren't already familiar with the landscape of Durotar because they did their initial adventuring in Mulgore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Same here. I spent a few hours in Skull Rock and wondered why I never got the pouch. There is a thread at <a href="https://www.worldofwarcraft.com" rel="nofollow">www.worldofwarcraft.com</a> in the shaman forumns with a walkthrough that someone made of the entire call of fire quest series with screenshots of maps. It's a good start if you are clueless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The cave is in Drygulch Ravine. Outside it are Burning blade Thugs and Burning Blade Noephytes. The name of the cave is Dustwind cave. You need to kill a few Burning Blade Clutists for the pouch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>coords. 52,29</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it is NOT in the ravine.&nbsp; It is above the path to Orgrimmar.&nbsp; Go east out of Razor Hill and IMMEDIATELY north, don't go all the way to the bluffs.<br /><a href="http://www.wowmacros.info/wowmacros/calloffire.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowmacros.info/wowmacros/calloffire.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i'm not sure why the quest is higher but this can be done at level 10 only in newbie gear, Tauren. Thanks to the above posts i was able to locate the cave easily and got the pouch drop from the first cultist killed (which was lucky I guess), and only had to kill 6 or so thugs/neophytes to get there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yea, the Burning Blades are doable at level 10, but the Razormane Geomancers are lvl12-13, so the quest is rated lvl13</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ehm. i did this quest on a shaman once&nbsp; but now when&nbsp; started a new shaman and were going to the dave i found no cultists there. i think they have changed their name or something. but i couldnt get a drop eather and i killed MANY of them :S:S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The thing that people have to realise that there is a whole area above ground, ie you can get on the cliffs you see above razor hill, the stones that cover almost the whole road from razor hill to orgrimmar, ect.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>53,29</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks for the information, I just found it after doing alot of grinding in the Skull Rock cave :O</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>its that reagent puch drop?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Start at Razor Hill. Going towards Org go to 54,38, making sure you stay on the upper level. From 54,38 you will be able to see the cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was running for a hour tan i have sreach thottbot and see you messenger if you in razor hill go behind razor hill and you see a mount you need clim on the mount and look for 58.38 you see a cave&nbsp; a warlock dropped by me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>don't look on the map here! its worng you see it on&nbsp; 58.38</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is so easy, but it took me forever to figure it out... Everyone above is right.<br />To make it easy as pie... I will quote the importants...<br /><br />&quot;DO NOT GO IN THE RAVINE FROM RAZOR HILL TO ORIG&quot;<br /><br />&quot;HEAD DUE EAST FROM RAZOR HILL&quot;<br /><br />&quot;IMMEDIATELY HEAD DUE NORTH&quot;<br /><br />You can't miss the cave.&nbsp; It's right in front of you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>thx i was looking for the cave like 5 hours and i did not find it your comments are realy helpfull thx&nbsp; all<br /><br />just i done it with other shamy at skull rock cave<br /><br />cya:D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Same story like with fire tar - first 3 mobs - nothing, then teh 4th - whuala!<br /><br />For those, who can't find the cave - go out of raor hill, walk a bit to east (till the end of the town), then turn north. there will be a plain, which goes dirrectly near the road to orgrimmar. go north, and in hte end of the plain stands the cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>there is written the imp minion got 100% drop but u cant loot a sommuned unit, only newbs dont know that!</div>

I REALLY appriciate the goo dinfo here on going up a ramp not IN the ravine. Thank you all who posted this was making me nuts.<br /><br />What about the guys with Fizzle, wont those guys drop it?
