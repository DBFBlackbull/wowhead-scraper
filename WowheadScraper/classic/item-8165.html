I farmed them for about 1,5 h and got 4 scales, about 60+ thick and 40+ heavy leather, 5 greens +- level 35 and about 2 gold in cash. Maybe I was lucky with the drop rate but it's easy farming there, only a few bears or the occasional Grimtotem will attack you. The Sprites don't hit hard but have a nasty long-range manaburn attack that sucks some 400 mana and deals a part of it as damage to you, so either let your pet keep aggro or bring some water^^.&nbsp; \nSince Camp Mojache is just around the corner you can unload vendor crap or mail the stacks to an alt.

I averaged out to about 10 an hour or so. If your lucky, you can skin 2 of one corpse</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took 5.5 hours to get the first 10 dragonscales for the quest. Now I have been in the badlands for the last 3 hours killing the same mobs non-stop and I have not looted a single dragonscale. There needs to be some kind of guaranteed drop system put in place to stop this madness. By the time I get around to making my first pair of Dragonscale Gauntlets, they are going to be worth 50 times their true value because of the vast amount of time spent collecting the dragonscale. It's boring and frutrating to the point of breaking things with a large hammer.<br /><br />It makes me wonder how hard the other leatherworking specialisations are?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>do people not understand how probability works?&nbsp; if a mob has a 25% drop rate, and you only get 1 out 20, it doesn't mean the drop rate is wrong, it means your sample is too small.&nbsp; kill, say, 200, and it'll start to look much more like 25%.&nbsp; same goes for the people that get 3 otu of 4 - you just got lucky.<br /><br />for worn scales, i recommend the whelps in the Badlands - easy level, low armor, slow attack spead, and decent drop rate.&nbsp; you can farm these guys (especially as a hunter) throughout your 40's, and you'll get a MUCH faster total drop rate than fighting elites with a slightly better drop rate that take 3 times as long to kill!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you are in the early forties the Sprite Darters in Feralas ( in and around a little valley next to the Grimtotem camp that's close to the main road) are a nice way to farm scales - they are total neutral and don't add if you slay them next to each other. I farmed them for about 1,5 h and got 4 scales, about 60+ thick and 40+ heavy leather, 5 greens +- level 35 and about 2 gold in cash. Maybe I was lucky with the drop rate but it's easy farming there, only a few bears or the occasional Grimtotem will attack you. The Sprites don't hit hard but have a nasty long-range manaburn attack that sucks some 400 mana and deals a part of it as damage to you, so either let your pet keep aggro or bring some water^^.&nbsp; <br />Since Camp Mojache is just around the corner you can unload vendor crap or mail the stacks to an alt. If you're Alliance, though, you're screwd - but what sane Alliance Hunter will take up Dragonscale Leatherworking anyway... <br /><br />Happy hunting</div>

If you do it this way, you'll be able to kill the dragons faster and more high lvl ones than you'd be able to do on your own. So next time you're at the Auction Hall, advertise that you want to get a Dragonscaling Party together and start farming these suckers the easy way!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got a few in dustwallow, by the den of flame..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ive put in 6 hours in the marsh, and only come across 5 scales 2 in one loot, 2 in another and 1 in the last. very rare at my level 43. mob does however list the drop rate 0.53% so im expected lots of time involved<br /><br />43 ne druid<br />silvermoon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Typically when I farm for these (As a lv. 39 hunter) I go to the valley in the badlands (east on the map)and kill whelps like crazy. You can also skin the elite dragons if anyone's killing those. Typically I spend an hour farming and get two stacks of thick leather and about 5 of these to drop. Plus all the other things that drop- normally the random stuff that drops from that'll give me about 1-2g and the thick leather sells for 3-4g a pop. Keep saving up those dragonscales and you can make a ton of money. You can make around 15-20 g in about 3 hours and also got 3 bars from leveling. Lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Which skill i need to skinn thoose lvl 52 elite dragons? I`m trying to powerlvl a skinner/Dragonscale LW, and want to know how much i need to skinn thoose so i know how much i have to raise my skill before i go there with my friend.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a skinner.. i did not find these scales thru drops but by skinning..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This item is listed as junk but it should be listed as a tradeskill item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got at least 12 of them doing a sunken temple run</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got 13 worn and 13 green in 2.5 hours farming around Pool of Tears in Swamp of Sorrows at level 51 by myself. 3 of the drops even had 2 scales. Additionally, I got 50 thick leather, 30 heavy leather, 3 auctionable green items, 3 gold in cash, and 5 gold in vendor trash.<br /><br />not too bad... obviously I was the only one around so i wasn't competing with other farmers for the kills. Just watch out for Somnus!</div>
