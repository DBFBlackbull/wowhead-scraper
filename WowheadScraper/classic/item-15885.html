<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;From the port of Auberdine, take the ship to Methiril, there you must quest through the lands of Azeroth, to the Dwarven mountains of Don Mourgh.&nbsp; Talk to the dwarves there, and follow the path to the great city of Ironforge.&nbsp; A gnome contraption (Tram) can get you from Ironforge to Stormwind, an enormous city of all Alliance races.&nbsp; From Stormwind, you will travel through the forests and head into the lands of Westfall.&nbsp; Seek shelter at Sentinel Hill, before questing west, to the Gold Coast Quarry from there, and move West-Northwest from there.&nbsp; There is an anchor stuck in the sea floor, go down from there into the depths of the sea.&nbsp; You will see a bubbling fissure.&nbsp; Down from the bubbling fissure is a sunken ship. The chest lies beneath the ship on the far side.&nbsp; You only have enough time to make it to the chest and use Teleport:Moonglade.&nbsp; So if you find the chest, get your pendant, and teleport.&nbsp; Don't bother trying to make it back to the bubbling fissure.&nbsp; You wont' need to.&nbsp; Good luck, and may the powers of Elune guide you. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Isn't Westfalls at the southern tip of the continent, and N. Tides Run is way further north? I've been looking around the half sunken ship at N. tides run and I can't find anything. <br /><br />I've read other posts where it says to go to Westfalls, but isn't that quite a distance from N. Tides Run? Oh man I'm confused. <br /><br />Also, how do you find your coordinates?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found both 2 parts, and found that i still need to be the proximity of the shrine of remulos to do that..wats that?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok for the horde one of the halves is at 29,29 west coast of the silverpine forest in the great sea.&nbsp; Just swim out to 29,29 then dive down. there is a fisher next to the chest so you don't have to worry too much about breath.<br /><br />The other half is in the barrens in the sludge fen.&nbsp; i don't know the exact coordinates but i entered from the north and spotted it right away.&nbsp; the sludge fen is not very big though so it was easier to find it there.<br /><br />good luck and enjoy the form that would make completing this quest 100% easier ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the easiest to get is the one in the barrens... its located in the water at the venture Co factory to the very north east in the barrens...<br />the otherone is more hard to find, its in Silverpine forest... swim out in the water in the north western part of silver pine (29,29) west from the ship that lies on the shore, and dive to the bottom. it is &quot;breath giving bubbles&quot; there so you can catch some air.. and the lockbox lies just next to the bubbles..<br />and to get the 2 pieces to 1 you have to use one of them at rumos shrine in moonglade... its a big tree on the map north west... good luck with this quest..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the hill is actually on you left when you come to the beach. if you swim straight out from the opening, right before it drops deep, the archor is there, but doesnt point to the bubbles. its just to the west of the archor, in the deep end, so swim deeper.&nbsp; Yes, there is a 22 elite shark there. :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just completed the (Alliance) Darkshore pendant part. Quite easy actually. I'm a level 17 Druid and it wasn't difficult at all.<br /><br />First of all, tloc to 49,11. Expect a chest quite far down on the ground at the northern part of one of the three &quot;claws&quot; sticking out of the water.<br /><br />Yes, a lot of threshers (the lochness large mobs). They're all roughly lvl 16, and in bear form they're easy to kill.<br /><br />I also recommend using bear form to swim. If you use num lock to continue swimming, you'll be underwater for much of the swim without needing to breathe (apparently your nose is out of water :P).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Standing on a shelf deep under water at 18,33.<br />There's a clam and a lockbox. Standing on the clam/fissure, I'm able to breath. From here I can see the ship another ledge below ahead of me.<br /><br />But thankfully, with the pendant moved in a patch, I've got my second half....<br /><br />Off to moonglade :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>29,29 is the correct coord for the silverpine location.. it is all the way at the bottom of the sea next to a bubbly fissure.. the sludge fen location is also next to a fissure.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as soon as i saw this quest i was worried about it<br />but don't be it just takes a tad bit of time mostly travel time<br /><br />1. sludge fen-the lockbox in the sludge fen is around or under the building INSIDE the lake easy to find <br /><br />2. silverpine forest-this by far is the toughest to find it is indeed at 29,29 and u must go to the bottom of the ocean floor so i suggest getting a breath before going down, just about as u want to head up for a breath u can see the bubbles and then u can open the lockbox from the bubbles and then u can juse teleport to moonglade <br /><br />i'd just like to thank u guys for giving horde the coordinates it helped me a ton =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive had my sea lion for about a month now and i love it.
