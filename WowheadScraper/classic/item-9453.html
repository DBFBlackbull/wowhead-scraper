So if you want a backstab, you will have to spend your combo points on a kidney shot, which will lead to that you can't throw away that eviscerate that you wanted.

When you're on it, jump down to the grey thing just below it, and jump down on the floor and re-stealth (when the mobs are far enough away from each other).\n\nNow you can stand stealthed until Viscous Fallout comes floating or hovering or whatever. I opened with Cheap Shot, and then spammed Sinister Strike until 5 points, then Eviscerate. After this, I let him hit me until my energy was at 100 again. That's when I pulled on Evasion (lasts for 15 secs), and started spamming Sinister Strike again up to 5 points, then Eviscerate. He should now be down to 20% life. You SHOULDN'T need to use a Healing Potion here, but if you must, do so. Keep spamming Sinister Strike until he's dead. Voila!\n\nI estimate I lost about 200-400 health (max) each time I was in combat with him. He's pretty easy really, so good luck and don't give up hope if it's not dropping the first few kills.

I can almost solo him at Level 32, but you need to use anything that will give you an edge (potions, thistle tea, evasion, etc.).  What I recommend is you find another rogue about the same level (it needs to be a rogue for the stealth) who also wants this dagger and do it together.  I did this and it took us 5 times before we both walked away with the dagger, reseting the instance between each attempt.\n\nThe hard part is that it is at the bottom of a pit that is crawling with Lvl 27-29 elite mobs.  You'll need to clear out an area to battle him in so you won't get adds.  I recommend along the wall about at the 3-4 o'clock position.\n\nTo get to the Slime Pit, once you have entered the Gnomeregan Instance entrance, stealth and proceed directly ahead to the pit edge.  Look down and try to jump onto one of the large gears sticking out of the ground (you'll take about 500-600 fall damage) or if you miss you'll take 700-800 damage, but you will stay stealthed.\n\nRest and heal.  Find the Viscous Fallout and watch his path, decide where you want to fight him and procede to clear mobs from the area.  If you get an add, chances are you won't survive the fight.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nEdited, Tue Feb 15 13:10:26 2005","date":"2005-02-15T19:06:05-06:00","rating":24,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Actually, any intelligent player can do this run - it doesn't need to be a rogue.

Though if you're about lvl 30 (Rogue) you can usually stealth in and jump down to Viscious Fallout. It took me 13 tries but I finally got it from him. Though its proc isn't that good for any kind of cowd control because it will break your saps and any sheeps (AoE poison effect).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sebas</b></h3>the proc can be annoying, but the damage is amazing for about 10 levels after you're able to use it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>batliff</b></h3>This dagger is easily soloable for a rogue at lvl 29 for you twink's out there. Would have to burn cooldown's and bring a health pot. Much more manageable with another rogue or druid combo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7600</b></h3>Very Easy to solo to get this dagger.<br /><br />As you all know, Viscous Fallout drops the dagger. He is easier than all the other elite mobs around him. He is very easy to solo with a rogue, just jump down off the platform and lead him into a small area. Make sure to bring a potion and use your cooldowns to ensure your victory.<br /><br />This weapon is also favored for twinks in the 20-29 brackets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>21145</b></h3>Nice dagger, used it up to level 35.<br /><br />Poison is ridiculous though, 15 Damage over 15 seconds, it's completely useless as DPS and it seems the sole purpose for it is to break Gouge...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Discolando</b></h3>Anyone ever watch the Toxic Avenger? Another nice reference from Blizzard. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The dagger is unique, this means each character can have only one of the item.&nbsp; That's why you weren't able to roll for a second.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sure, Toxic Revenger has a very good damage for dealing out backstabs, ambushes and everything that doesn't depend on weapon speed, BUT, and a big BUT:<br /><br />Chance on hit: Deals 5 Nature damage every 5 sec to any enemy in an 8 yard radius around the caster for 15 sec.<br /><br />This little &quot;enhancement&quot; is actually a really annoying &quot;I hope that chance won't hit&quot; thing. Why? Because a backstabbing rogue probably uses gouge and those worthless 5 dmg will break off the gouge and ruin your backstab (you will need REALLY good timing if you are to be able to succeed with the backstab when that crappy nature dmg has started). So if you want a backstab, you will have to spend your combo points on a kidney shot, which will lead to that you can't throw away that eviscerate that you wanted. And the fact that the gouge is ruined will result in you being hit by your mob, resulting in extra dmg taken which will probably require time consuming healing after the fight.<br /><br />So sure, it's a great damage dealer at a low lvl, but I am doing everything I can to be able to throw this dagger away because of its so very annoying &quot;enhancement&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>1. Where he is.</b><br /><br />You go inside the instance. Jump down to the lower walkway before all the mobs. Then you sneak out to the edge right in front of you. Fall down and hug the wall. I usually get 650ish dmg, but a friend of mine got 913 dmg one time... we have no idea why. The Viscous Fallout have a path back and forth there, so just stay put and learn his moves. When you have your back to the wall you must kill the mob on the right. When that is done you can kill the VF with no adds.<br /><br /><b>2. Remember the Chest</b><br /><br />At the top of the Slime pit there is a fan like place with 3 mobs. To get there from the VF you need to go up to the Clean Area where the cozy healer gnomes are, move on up the stairs, take a left when u get out on the walkway and you will c a narrow bridge over to the &quot;fan&quot;. On the far side of the fan there is a chest guarded by 1 mob. The chest has always dropped green stuff so its a waste not to go get it when you are in there :)<br /><br /><b>3. How to reset an Instance.</b><br /><br />I have been having some problems lately with resetting the instance. I tried to log, wait 10 min and nothing worked. He did not spawn again. Don’t know if this is a bug or what. If there are 2 of you, you both just get out and regroup outside. BUT! check if he has respawed when you get in. It has happened 1 time where he did not respawn even when we did this. <br /><br /><b>4. Where is Gnomeredan</b><br /><br />Its on the west wall of the map where Iron Forge has its exit, Dun Morogh.<br /><br />Ok then, all have fun and good hunting! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took 7 tries here. <br />Found a real easy way to get in and out in about 5 minutes. <br /><br />After entering run in kill the 2-3 mobs right at the ledge as you run up <br /><br />Just at the bottom of tthose few stairs you can drop down and live, just run straight to the wall and eat /bandage then wait right there until he pat's around (about 30 seconds ) <br /><br />Kill him then stealth back up rinse repeat. <br /><br />I did it 5 times in a row so fast the first night that I got a message that i have entered to many instances recntly and it wouldnt let me back in. <br /><br />the next day I got it on the second run&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I didn't realize how lucky I am.&nbsp; After a couple of runs through Gnomer, I have both the Toxic Revenger and Electrocutioners Leg.<br /><br />They duel weld great together.&nbsp; I'm currently a lvl 33 warrior and I've had this combo for a couple of levels now.<br /><br />Stinky dagger + Zappy Sword = Much fun!<br /><br />Buchina</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got it on my first run.&nbsp; It took longer to get from Ironforge to Gnomer, than it did inside the instance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got this wepon and planning on using it in offhand but it only took me 1 try to get it it was simply i had a 41 run me through so it took like 15 minuets beacus we took the long way. Its a sick wepon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>4 runs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; fallout<br />1 toxic revenger<br />1 hydrocane<br />2 acidic walker<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pummeler<br />1 mannuel crowd pummeler<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; electrocutioner 6000<br />2 lagnut rings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; therma plug<br />3 charged gears</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Surprisingly easy at 28. Soloing Serra'kis was much harder at same lvl<br />1. Thats what you need:<br />- superior healing pot - 1 per attempt<br />- strong alcohol - 5 per attempt recommended<br />- poisons and such not crucial<br />2 Tactics:<br />- Use main entrance to instance and just head to the edge.<br />- position yourself above giant gadget thing (also reminds of a huge clock) and jump down. You will not only survive, but will&nbsp; be out of agro range. Restealth, go down and walk to south-eastern corner of the room facing the right side of the gadget<br />- path Viscous Fallout takes is complicated, this is the best place to wait for him, but its recommended to kill a mob (slime or elem) crawling nearby<br />- drink alcohol and pull the boss when he is near. Dynamite pull is better if you can. No leet skillzz needed- better start with Evasion, after a while drink healing etc. Not too hard.<br />- go back to instance entrance through gnome outpost, it wont take long. If horde, sneak past gnomes, only danger is stairs with 2 guards<br />- restart<br /><br />Drop chance is about 20%. <br />100% positive each rogue can get the dagger at the very 27 lvl. Enough to get Outlaw sabre for main hand and dmg is sufficient.<br />Good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im a 29 twink gnome rogue wth this dagger and zelot blade and this combo rules!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay, here goes<br /><br />1. Enter Gnomeregan, go down the elevator<br />2. Stealth along, take the long corridor to your left towards the main entrance and enter the instance<br />3. Once in the instance, go straight ahaid, at the T-section, take a right<br />4. Walk along for about 5 yards, look into the centre of the circle you're running around, you should see some sort of cylinder with a pole going through it (2 of em actually, one above the other ), kinda like gears.<br />5. line up to the gears, take a deep breath and jump. You should land on the lower of the 2 cylinders<br />6. jump further down first onto the grey platform (you can restealth now), then onto the ground<br />7. now wait a while and do /target Viscous every now and again. He'll show up<br />8. To get out go along the dormitory, then on to the clean zone, up the stairs and around the circle till you end up where you started<br />9. Rince and repeat at will<br /><br />P.S - i've been stealth-running him myself. So far, 12 runs, only boots, staff and assorted &quot;junk&quot; :'( so fingers crossed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - imo the best place to take him out when stealthing is along the eastern side of the circle, where the floor kinda slants up.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - at lvl 31 i take him out without any potions, sometimes i use evasion just to be on the safe side. and stunlock ofcourse. <br />Good Luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've got it in the 4th or 5th round, then I got the Toxic Revenger. But, I wasn't in a group with 5 players, I was with my brother. He's a level 60, so it wen't fine :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am lvl 31 troll rogue and it took me 13 runs to get the dagger to drop. I was ready to tear my hair out, but have patience... for those who wait gets rewarded! I was having some problems killing him at first, but then I found the &quot;right&quot; technique, which I'd like to share here.<br /><br />I was using 2x swords (Wingblade &amp; Outlaw Sabre), and I had no buffs. Do as has been pointed out earlier up on this page: when you enter the instance, go right and jump down on the cylinder-like thing. When you're on it, jump down to the grey thing just below it, and jump down on the floor and re-stealth (when the mobs are far enough away from each other).<br /><br />Now you can stand stealthed until Viscous Fallout comes floating or hovering or whatever. I opened with Cheap Shot, and then spammed Sinister Strike until 5 points, then Eviscerate. After this, I let him hit me until my energy was at 100 again. That's when I pulled on Evasion (lasts for 15 secs), and started spamming Sinister Strike again up to 5 points, then Eviscerate. He should now be down to 20% life. You SHOULDN'T need to use a Healing Potion here, but if you must, do so. Keep spamming Sinister Strike until he's dead. Voila!<br /><br />I estimate I lost about 200-400 health (max) each time I was in combat with him. He's pretty easy really, so good luck and don't give up hope if it's not dropping the first few kills. Keep trying and soon you'll have it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got Toxic Revenger today.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had read that this drop was possible as a 29 rogue and thought I would give it a try.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Nice dagger, got it first run in this instance with my guild.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>very good for aoe dmg straight into 40s. even when its dmg becomes outdated, can still equip it for aoe dmg. 15dmg aoe to all targets is very nice. people want a weapon proc, but even if you get that mace from uld that procs 85-115 target fire dmg, this will do more against zerg of mobs. say 20, for example. 15x20=300. even against 10, thats 150, still more then proc on uld mace. that weapon does it to single target, but aoe is what you are looking for, in aoe situations.<br /><br />with that said, id just like to point out the answer to commonly asked question. when this procs, it drops a dot to all mobs around you, which stays on them to do its dmg for the duration. it does not follow you around like a ds aoe like the weapon info suggests.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me 6 times. The first and last time the dagger dropped, but I missed the first as there were 2 of us going for the dagger and I lost the roll. the middle 4 I soloed (lvls 28-36) as a rogue and came up with the boots and staff. Last night, couple 60s went in cause they were bored, we cleaned the whole dungeon and I ended up making 5 gold from all the drops - they just gave them to me, as I am saving for my mount and this was their donation to me.<br /><br />Cannot say this is my favorite dungeon, but it is ok, and the drops are decent. and BTW, Tigerbane dagger is easier to get at AH, and has the same dps. only difference is it is +18 attack power against beasts. It actually cost less to get Tigerbane than it did to repair my armor 6 times from running the Gnomeragan instance.</div>

Dropped off of one of the slimes, don't remember the name. G'luck to anyone trying to get this dagger, hope you get as fortunate as I did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got it on 2nd try, well, an warrior level 60 got it for me xD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I ran Gnomer with a crappy group and a lvl 52 from my guild we all wiped and the other 3 ppl were leaving and then its only me and the war.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Vicous Fallout that drops this dagger (20% chance) is in the Hall of Gears, aka the Slime Pit.<br /><br />It is a Level 30 elite mob. I can almost solo him at Level 32, but you need to use anything that will give you an edge (potions, thistle tea, evasion, etc.). What I recommend is you find another rogue about the same level (it needs to be a rogue for the stealth) who also wants this dagger and do it together. I did this and it took us 5 times before we both walked away with the dagger, reseting the instance between each attempt.<br /><br />The hard part is that it is at the bottom of a pit that is crawling with Lvl 27-29 elite mobs. You'll need to clear out an area to battle him in so you won't get adds. I recommend along the wall about at the 3-4 o'clock position.<br /><br />To get to the Slime Pit, once you have entered the Gnomeregan Instance entrance, stealth and proceed directly ahead to the pit edge. Look down and try to jump onto one of the large gears sticking out of the ground (you'll take about 500-600 fall damage) or if you miss you'll take 700-800 damage, but you will stay stealthed.<br /><br />Rest and heal. Find the Viscous Fallout and watch his path, decide where you want to fight him and procede to clear mobs from the area. If you get an add, chances are you won't survive the fight.<br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />Edited, Tue Feb 15 13:10:26 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got this first time i was ever in gnomeregan. my party got aggrevated at my luck, won everything i rolled for, and rolled 100 twice, one of those 100's was on this pretty dagger. I have gone in more times when i was higher level solo, and i have gotten the dagger everytime. so now i have gotten this damn dagger 6 times, while other people are whining about not getting it at all. I say you go buy a lucky rabbits foot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone have any issues with the <b>Proc</b> breaking GOUGE? If so maybe claw of the shadowmancer would be a better twink dagger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Went in 3 more times, for guildies to get this dagger. (I went in on main, 49 shammy). <br />Got is after 4 runs, the second one after runs, and the 3rd we got in 1 run. Had alot of boots and 2 staffs :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This dagger is great for rogues who wanna stay in 20-29 Battlegrounds as ambush rogues .. slow for a dagger but hits hard with ambush. i would say the best lvl 29 rogue combo is Toxic Revenger and Torturing Poker... im working on a rogue to do this with ATM and cant wait to get my revenger.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Oct 26 23:24:15 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>went in there at level 30, dropped the first time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>hmmm ... first - drop rate is 45% not 20%, second - i solo him on level 29 (troll rouge), very hard fight but possible so ... good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I also did this with a high level friend, around 8 shoes, 5 hydrocanes; 1 dagger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>8 pairs of boots, 4 canes, and then finally this freaking thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You guys are unfortunate...i thought i was bad luck because i only seen the staff like 3 times and the boots 5 but ive seen dagger drop like 27 times....i got 1 on my rogue and it was nice in 29 bg it was totally worth it though i kept it til my high 30's....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i did it twice with my rogue and my friends druid we cleared the area so i could get exp and the first time i got the boots, the second time i got the dagger.. the next weapon i will have is the jade serpentblade.... its good for a lvl 30 when i get there<br /><br />Edania; rogue-Rexxar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's easy to get to him, just go straight in, jump down, look for him. I've done this run for the cane, dagger and acid walkers. Usualy get the dagger in 2-3 runs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was able to solo Viscious Fallout at lvl 30. Had to use evasion, healing potion and first aid tho and it was a close fight. First 2 times dropped Acidic Walkers, 3rd time Hydrocane, 4th time dropped precioussss dagger yesterday :D<br />Hydrocane is nice too. Need to visit weapon master so I can live underwater :)<br /><br />It's easy to get to Viscous Fallout as a rogue with stealth. Enter instance, go straight in, jump down, kill mob to the right first to get a little more room to fight VF. Heartstone to IF, wait like an hour and go back in.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jul 11 09:01:44 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this dagger at lvl 31. Ran part of the instance with a 33 priest who kept going on and on about how we had to kill this mob Viscous Fallout so I could get this dagger, if it dropped.<br /><br />Sure enough it did drop and she went right ahead and passed on it so I got. She seemed really happy for me too so the whole situation was kind of weird.<br /><br />As for the dagger itself it's been serving me well so far. People were telling me it'd be a crappy dagger because it would aggro other mobs on me with its nature damage effect, but chances are if I'm within 8 yds of a mob it's going to aggro anyway. Unless it's a much lower level than I am, then it'd be insignificant anyway.<br /><br />Others were telling me that it would ruin sap or gouge. True enough, I suppose, but the two haven't aligned yet so we'll see what situation I am when it does.<br /><br />Nice little dagger to have.<br /><br />Also, it's unique so don't come complaining here when you already have one and aren't allowed to roll on a second one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>im a 41 rogue and i still have this dagger, i really like it, but i need a change!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this dagger when I was lvl 22. my friend who is a lvl 58 rogue help me get it. I didn't even have to ask.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Have they nerfed this drop after 1.10 or something, i've killed this fellow 22 times now and seen 16 boots and 6 staffs...<br /><br />Edit: Got it on my 26th bloody try.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 27 16:23:12 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nos324</b></h3>I was worried about what people were saying about the proc DoT effect ruining gouge -&gt; backstab, but it really isn't a big deal. It doesn't proc that often and you can even time your gouge if you watch for the poison tick and get your bs in. Really nice slow dagger for a backstab/ ambush spec.</div>
