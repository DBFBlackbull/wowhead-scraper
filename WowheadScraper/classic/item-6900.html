Finding the books was ok solo'ing, had to improvise some ghetto tactics for the packs of murlocs in Hillbrad, but it worked out fine (as in I spent hours looking for the damn book, finding it was tougher than killing hundreds of those damn slimeballs). My priest already had the pattern for the Robe of Arcana, so that worked out fine too (side-note for all those gold hogs in AHs around the game, not cool selling this robe for 5g just because it's a quest item).\n\nCame the part happening in Desolace; I did fine on the satyrs because of their level, it was easy and just a matter of looting 10 blood samples. The infernal stone however made me a bit nervous. I solo'ed it at lv32, with my voidie. I had to make sure it was a lv36 infernal tho, because I wasted 20 minutes trying to down a lv37 and it just wouldn't work (I'd get him to ~10%, voidie would die, and my ghetto kiting skills with CoA on it didn't work). Anyway, the lv36 went down fine; 500 xp on rested bar, woot. ;)\n\nThe last part is where I had to get help for the first time, there's no way I can kill any of those lv37-39 fire elementals; I tried, everything would get resisted (or just about). A lovely lv42 priest was grinding nearby, she was good enough to group up with me to get me the 2 coal samples.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7325</b></h3>Very good robes, I personally used them up until 40 (when I could use Lich's Robes). I did the quest at 33, however, I had to get a high level friend to help.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>41084</b></h3>These are amazing robes for the level. If you can get a friend to help so you can do the quest when it first becomes available, do so; you won't regret it. My lock ended up wearing these well into her 50s because nothing better ever dropped. Good caster robes can be hard to come by, so don't miss out on these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually you pick the quest up from the Warlock trainer, its a long series of quests</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Get to level 31 and talk to Ms. Voidrender in Ratcher. You don't need to talk to a trainer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here is what it looks like on the human female with nothing over it (like gloves, bracers, ect.).<br /><br /><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/cimorene/WoW/bloodrobe.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/cimorene/WoW/bloodrobe.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did the quest at 31 and by the time it was done I was 32.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; I love this robe and had it all the way up to 56.&nbsp; I just made myself a Mooncloth Robe and it rocks.&nbsp; But still loved the Enchanted Glod Bloodrobe.&nbsp; Its worth it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its not so hard. The robe of Arcana you can buy at the AH for 1g and 30s. The same with gold bar.<br />Took me 1 Hour to collect 10 &quot;Vial of Hatefury Blood&quot; i North west of Desolace, in a place called &quot;Sargeron&quot;. Only need 1 &quot;Lesser Infernal Stone&quot; Thats south in Desolace. Thats all.<br />Its the quests that makes the game funny.<br />33 level warlock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Guys i soloed this thing up until the fire elementals, and thats because there was already a warrior farming for fire essence or something. The only thing i can see anyone having trouble with would be the 38 or 37 Lesser Infernals, which isn't too bad. It is a very long quest though, soloing and looking for the places i needed to go took all day, about 6 hours from start to finish, but at my level it is well worth it. ;) audi</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i did this at lvl 32....no problems untill the fire elements but since i got both the coals&nbsp; in only two kills this was easy:P:P...and i am loving the robe!:P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Of course the Robes of Lich are better...if you're already lvl 39, but seeing as you can finish this quest long before then, the Gold Bloodrobe is great...geez.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is pretty easy for the rewards.&nbsp; You can buy the robe/gold bar from AH.&nbsp; The elementals are lvl 33 and you can enslave them to kill each other.&nbsp; The infernals aren't too hard if they are orange to you.&nbsp; The only difficult part was the fire elementals.&nbsp; I got there and they were all red to me, I wasn't able to kill one, let alone several for the quest drops.&nbsp; On top of that there were 3 lvl 60 alliance who were farming the area making it impossible for me to do enough front load damage to claim the mob as my own :( <br /><br />Had to get a lvl 60 guildie to help me and after killing 4 of them I got my 2 coals and turned it in for my robe :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a lvl 31, i soloed almost the entire quest, except for the fire elementals in Arathi.<br />Just use your VW as he is suposed to be used and you can kill mobs5 levels higher then you! :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm level 31 and just got the robe.&nbsp; I soloed the entire series except the last part where you have to kill some fire elementals to get the smoldering coal.&nbsp; They are level 38/39 so there is no way a level 31 can kill them.&nbsp; There was a level 51 warrior helping a guildmate at the ring so he helped my kill enough elementals for it to drop (I think we had to kill about 6 for the two coals to drop).<br /><br />The robe is awesome, totally worth doing this series as soon as you get it at level 31.&nbsp; If you have to, get people to help you.&nbsp; This is the best robe you're going to have for a while, and the sooner you get it, the longer it will last you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hello, I'm at level 60 and still have this robe. Simply because I've never found anything better to replace it with. 10 extra armor makes no difference, and the stats are like the same or even better than on other robes over lvl 50. Now, I'm just waiting for dreadmist to drop.<br />Correct me if I'm wrong tho :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You Need Stamina and Intellect as A Warlock. The Robes of Power are certainly not better IMO. And as someone else said Armor is not that big of a deal with Cloth. Stats, stats, stats is what you are looking for. I wouldn't trade this for something with 100 armor unless it had better stats. I'm level 50 and no I have not found anything even in the Auction house at those prices that will work better at this point. I may indeed find something later but this is a very good robe especially at the level you can get it and you dont need to run an instance &quot;hoping to get a drop&quot; And by the way, who the heck cares what stuff &quot;looks&quot; like ? This ain't a fashion show.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone quiet about the robes of the lich. We've established that they are better and that you need to be many levels higher to wear them. Now shush.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is always funny this, that the lower you scroll down the comments about a long quest line like this (or for the Verigan's Fist, or Whirlwind Axe, or whatever), the lower are the level of the ones who have claimed to soloed the quest; and when you get so low that the quest can't even be obtained at lower level, people then start to out-brag each other about how short <i>time</i> it took them to solo it:/ It is not that I am accusing any of the above posters of lying - God knows there are enough people out there who spend enough time at this game to be leet and uber enough to actually pull it off - but I am just making the point that the people who needs to look up things in Thottbot are unlikely to be the kind of people who could, say, get the Bloodrobe at level 31 in four hours, or the Verigan's Fist at level 20 in two hours, and they are not very much helped by hearing of your no doubt awesome skill.<br /><br />Mind you, all this bragging is at least somewhat helpful when you want to estimate the price a particular item might go for on the AH: On one end, someone will post how cheap they bought it from some clueless nub, followed by several posts from people who bought it even cheaper, and on the other end someone will post how much they sold it for, followed by posts from people who sold it for more; if you take the average of them all, you can actually come up with a pretty good estimate for how much the thing should go for:)<br /><br />But enough about that: What I really wanted to ask is, should I, as a level 33, use the Robe of Power (which I farmed, raised my tailoring skill and bought the mats for at the expense of a considerable amount of time and money before I found out that the Bloodrobe even existed) until such a time as I can more or less easily solo this quest for myself? Or is the Robe of Power useless for locks, so that I should try to find some friends and get the Bloodrobe as soon as possible? Thankful for any and all answers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got these robes at 32/33.<br />i lvled turning in quest, but i needed help with the fire elementals at the end.&nbsp; i just got a 40 druid to help, and it was a cakewalk.&nbsp; GL2ALL<br /><br />-Jhesta <br />33 Lock <br />Icecrown</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Started this quest at lv31 and finished at lv32, on my first 'lock ever; cool thing I'm finding out about this class is the number of class quests, it definitely makes this class a lot more fun to play.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the quests; challenging and a lot of fun. Finding the books was ok solo'ing, had to improvise some ghetto tactics for the packs of murlocs in Hillbrad, but it worked out fine (as in I spent hours looking for the damn book, finding it was tougher than killing hundreds of those damn slimeballs). My priest already had the pattern for the Robe of Arcana, so that worked out fine too (side-note for all those gold hogs in AHs around the game, not cool selling this robe for 5g just because it's a quest item).<br /><br />Came the part happening in Desolace; I did fine on the satyrs because of their level, it was easy and just a matter of looting 10 blood samples. The infernal stone however made me a bit nervous. I solo'ed it at lv32, with my voidie. I had to make sure it was a lv36 infernal tho, because I wasted 20 minutes trying to down a lv37 and it just wouldn't work (I'd get him to ~10%, voidie would die, and my ghetto kiting skills with CoA on it didn't work). Anyway, the lv36 went down fine; 500 xp on rested bar, woot. ;)<br /><br />The last part is where I had to get help for the first time, there's no way I can kill any of those lv37-39 fire elementals; I tried, everything would get resisted (or just about). A lovely lv42 priest was grinding nearby, she was good enough to group up with me to get me the 2 coal samples. I was set!<br /><br />Sweet quest reward, very happy with it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just finished the quest and got my robe...finally.&nbsp; it's a nice robe too, well worth the effort.&nbsp; I did this quest at 31!&nbsp; I got help with the infernal and the elementals.&nbsp; but the rest is soloable.&nbsp; most is just running from here to there.&nbsp; but tell people what you need this for and they are more than willing to help most of the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just did this quest at lvl 32, the fire elementals are by far the worst (after the added hp to mobs), you should bring friends (I coped with it solo) but it'll save you quite some time with a party.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you are on the Kalecgos Server PST me I can make these robes I have the recipe of course it will be a small fee to make them an even larger fee if you don't have the materials</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Very easy to get once you have the pattern or buy the robe of aracana.<br /><br />The hardest fight is the 37ish elemental which is cake for a low 30s warlock solo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the only thing i didn't like about this quest was all the boring traveling needed. ;P<br /><br />i got my robe at lvl 31 -- had some help with the infernal (got him down to very low health and then, incredibly, a night elf druid helped me out).. and the elementals (two other higher level warlocks were there for the same reasons), so it was rather easy.<br /><br />sweet ass robe, too.<br /><br />(hatsumomô, 31 undead warlock, mal'ganis)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As noted elsewhere in the quest description, best way to take out the fire elementals is to camp the nearby water elementals for the cresting charms, which instant kill the fire elementals. Just take the fire elemental down to 49% health and then use the charm. Also don't forget that if the elemental is not dot'd, such as when they wear off, just banish it real quick to bind wound/life tap as needed. Takes a little longer to kill but still quicker then dieing and rezzing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There is no way a lock farmed this solo at 32-33. You are wearing table-cloths for armor. you aren't soloing level 39 mobs, let alone multiple 38-39 mobs. <br />Quit lieing and get a life.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Robe of Power, enchanter with +100/150hp is quite better than that.<br />Soloed the quest on 34 lvl, leveled to 35 and finished it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Don't care what the stats are, yet again Blizzard seem to ignore Horde, the only 2 places you can farm for Pattern are both Alliance Territory. If you are Orc or Undead warlock, forget farming for this pattern you will waste so much time trying to get a 1% drop. You'd be better off farming money to buy something equal on AH and sticking an enchant on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Soloed the fire elementals @34, using an affliction-build lock and my Void Walker.<br /><br />Corruption -&gt; Siphon life -&gt; Amplify Curse -&gt; Curse of Agony.<br />Life funnel on Void Walker until the Infernal attacks.<br />Sacrifice VW -&gt; Life tap / update Dot's.<br />Oh, and cast insta-SB's when you get nightfall...<br /><br />Should be fine, but bring healing potions just in case.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dont think that you can solo as you say the fire elementals at lvl 33...<br /><br />They are lvl 39 FFS and I went there with another fellow lock 33 lvl as well and we got analed from a 39 elemental and I am running really good gear.<br /><br />With tons of potions, stones, FA, etc we might kill 1 but that is the 2 of us. <br /><br />There is no way you can solo it on lvl 33, mainly because its immune to immolate, and resists 19/20 spells on it. Also shadow bolt does 10-20 dmg max to them.<br /><br />Please dont give false directions.<br /><br />You can however solo the 36 lvl Infernal but its 3 lvls difference from you so its ok.<br /><br />The statment <div class="quote-box">The hardest fight is the 37ish elemental which is cake for a low 30s warlock solo</div> is way off since the elems are 39 and a few 38 lvl.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Mar 18 12:43:18 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I managed to solo all the bits upto the elementals at level 31/32. Went to arathi walked over to the elementals and found 2 other warlocks trying to kill them for robe. Suggested we all tried together, killed 7 elementals and ended up with 6 coals. Job done. <br /><br />Looks nice on my orc :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's a good robe up until Robe of the Lich i suppose. <br /><br />Slap a +100hp to chest enchant on it, and you have a robe with +200hp, +255int on it. Then when you get Robe of the Lich, slap another +100hp on that. +300hp, +150int. You'd lose 105int for +100hp but the HP is worth more imo. These two robes go a long, long way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Lol Im in an MC raiding guild and theres a lock in it who STILL has this robe at 60. Feel sorry for him, but it is a great robe, got mine at level 30.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hello every 1, I finished the quest 2 days ago, and i found it to be a pain in the @$$, i had help from a lvl 42 pally, cuz i did the quest at lvl 31 :P, however i didnt like buying a robe of arcana becuase some ppl in the AH are theives and sell things for more, but hey i needed it and the pattern wasnt for sale, and i didnt feel like farming for it, so i bought it out for 2.5G i was told that was a bargain but i doubt it, the rest was easy with DemonPally, the smoldering coal was annoying, i with the help of DEMONpally killed like 15 Fire Guys i got two elemental fires though :).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I cant seem to be able to find any anywhere. I look on AH and advertise everyday no luck. Any ideas?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Started the quest at 80% into 31, leveled to 32 when I was getting the first couple of reagents. Did everything in this quest solo except the Elementals in Arathi. And that was kinda easy too, two Elementals killed, two Coals dropped :) I'm on the boat from BB to Ratchet now, can't wait for my sexy robe :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This doesnt seem worth it for tailors. At lvl 33 tailors can use Robe of Power, which has worse stats, but actually has dmg. Tailoring lvl might be a bit behind it at lvl 33, but u should be able to get the robe atleast by lvl 35 with a lot less cost and time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Basic warlock robe till 40+, some still having it till 50s(lazy on upgrades). this quest is easily soloable at 35+. the fire elementals are toughest part because they have fire shield that hurts you every few seconds, then they are imune to any fire spells, so stick to shadow spells, fear kiting them with succubus proved to be much easier then having void tank them, they were also far enough apart for it when i did it. the infernos are easy, if you are having any trouble, you can even charm one to kill another, with dots there isnt a chance yours would lose, put it on hold and hearth/run afterwards. inferno has far more hp then your void ever will at that lvl, and hits more then succubus, with self dmg shield. as for robes of arcana, you should either buy the robe in AH, gather regeants and find someone that can make it, or camp the pattern yourself with regeants and find a tailorer. the mobs that drop pattern in darkshore are easy slaughter for any lvl30+ character.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i solod it all at lv 32 until the fire elementals, needed the help of my lvl 37 mage buddy then :) infernal wasnt too hard only had to kill one to get the drop.<br /><br />longest stage was getting the robe, luckily i had the mats already but i still had to yell in IF for ages until someone was on that could actually make it. <br /><br />shame i look like 50% of locks but im sure the stats will make upm for it :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah this quest takes a decent chunk of time and you can expect to do a good amount of walking, flying, and sailing. Completed as lvl 32, but I had to get help for the elementals at the end (mainly due to horde coming by and killing me while I was fighting them.) It <i>is</i> possible to complete at lvl 32/33 solo, but you're probably going to be very frustrated at some points along the way. Had to dish out a good bit of money (6g) for the robes at the begining.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok...the hardest part with this is probelly farming for the pattern. i was farming it for like 2 hours till someone showed up and told me that she can make it for me as long i got the required stuff. <br />i started the quest the moment i accepted it...dunno wut level...34..35? b/c i'm on a pvp server, i died most of the time..in rachet (imagine me doing other lock quests...succubus)<br />i for one, do not think this sould b soloed by level 33s or 34s. the infernals...yeah...fire elementals...nah. does who said they soloed it at 33? bull!@#$</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah i solo'd everything, including the damn elementals. I used my felhunter as added help. the 38's were ok , the 39's were a tad bit troublesome, but doable. Only thing that got on my nerves were the other TWO people farming the same area, and would run around killing them before i could, so i had to wait for respawns. :/ I can't stand that. took at least 30mins to get 2. &gt;:(<br /><br />Oh! and to the guys who got the Robe of Arcana for 2g/2.5g, you got it GOOD.<br />On my server (Hellscream) the robes are going for 7g+. I got my for 7g :sigh:</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Emsarrev</b></h3>Quick rundown on this quest:<br /><br />Get <a href="/classic/item=5770/robes-of-arcana">Robes of Arcana</a> and a <a href="/classic/item=3577/gold-bar">Gold Bar</a> before heading down to the Barrens to save you the trip later on. <br /><br />At level 31, the lowest level you can get this quest, you will probably struggle to kill the Infernal in desolace and the fire elementals in Arathi. If you have a friend who can help with those, that'll help a lot in getting this quest done quickly. The fire elementals can be a pain on a PvP server since they're a popular farming spot for Elemental Fire. Even with a friend, you might be looking at a tough time there.<br /><br />Overall, for the effort involved in getting this item, I'd strongly suggest <a href="/classic/item=7054/robe-of-power">Robe of Power</a> as an alternative if you have tailoring and some spending gold for the mats it takes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wax0pal</b></h3>Not too bad. Everything is very soloable at lvl 33 (I did use Cresting Charms for the burning exiles). You have to run around a bit but it made me get flight points I was going to have to get at some point anyway. Seems like a really good robe for the level, for a non-tailor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shakimo</b></h3>I did this quest at 31 got to 32 getting the bloodrage vials or whatever and had my dad help me with the fire elemantals which we struggled with since he was 31 mage but got better after using curse of the elements on them. All of this to find out that my robe with spellpower from a dungeon is better. I should have looked up the robe before doing the chain but hey at least I got some xp.</div>
