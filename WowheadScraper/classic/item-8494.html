The drop rate is about 1 in 10,000. O_o<br /><br /><b>EDIT:</b> 4.5 years later, as mentioned below, these now drop from any mob in STV.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>18869</b></h3>I have one for sale on Destromath. If you are horde, send me an in game mail to Punxbank if interested.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>43653</b></h3>I have slayed MILLIONS of Bloodsail Mobs, still haven't got one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This pet is easily the rarest in the game.&nbsp; Easily.<br /><br />I've been (mage) AoE farming the pirates for the last few nights, doing each full boat at a time, with about 2 minutes between each.&nbsp; Killed several thousand, but just in case I've always checked the auction house to see if a bird was in there for a reasonable price.<br /><br />And tonight, among the 20 Green Wing Macaws, was a Hyacinth... with 1 gold buyout. 30 shakiest seconds of WoW I've ever had waiting for that auction to confirm.<br /><br />The moral: It's a huge pain to farm, and you may never get one, but you may get lucky with some clueless level 30 who doesn't check sites like this.<br /><br />Good luck hunters!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I initially tried selling this on AH for like 5g... I knew it was rare drop... But obviously not that rare. Nobody bought, so I figured why not see what it looks like. I did, I was amazed! I love this pet. I hate keeping more than one pet, and this is the one I chose to&nbsp; take everywhere. All bloodsails in STV drop them, but yes it is insanely rare that they drop. Those who think this is the rarest pet in the game, YOUR RIGHT! Who needs Blizz promo pets, when you can get one that even fewer people have.<br /><br />This parrot is Blue and Teal with Purple tipped feathers, and a yellow stripe along the wingspan. It is easily the most evil looking parrot available. Those dragonlings are nothing compared to this pet.<br /><br />To those of you willing to farm it, good luck, and treasure it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here's a picture of my old Macaw. He's beautiful. I ended up giving it to Sunra, the proud new owner.<br /><br /><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v408/therealneil24/Picture2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v408/therealneil24/Picture2.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yeah... I was going to gain faction with the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Then realizing how much rep I needed I quickly changed my mind and went to get my Bootybay rep back... I was pretty bummed that I couldnt get my Bloodparrot untill... I killed Fleet Master Firillon and the parrot cage dropped. Haha, I was so happy... Uhh yeah just thought I would share that story. The bird is on par with an epic item (Drop % wise) so if you get it dont sell it but rather equip it. 100G is nice but being one of the few people on your server to have one is even better. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Using the data given above as of this writing on 2/20/2007, the five lower level mobs shown above to drop the parrot have been killed a total of 391,531 times, dropping it only 29 of those. Simple math lead to the following calculation:<br /><br />391531 / 29 = 13,501.068965517241 = 13,502<br /><br />So, given that the data above is correct, this the Hyacinth Macaw drops 1 time for approximately every 13,500 level 40-43 Bloodsails killed <b>on average</b>, or at a .00007406820915841% drop rate, to be precise.<br /><br />In short, it's quite a rare pet.&nbsp; :)</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
