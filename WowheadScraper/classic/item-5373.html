Despite what the data on the web page may tell you, they are pickpocketed NOT dropped - at least in Razor Hill. If the comment above about the Redridge orcs is accurate, I'd recommend you do that instead, because at least then you're not dealing with PvP flagged mobs. Aside from the slow drop rate in Razor Hill, I had at least three or four &quot;player issues&quot; I had to deal with while I was trying to gather these pieces.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I find it slightly amusing that you people actualy think that there is anything in this game that increases your odds of getting higher rolls or better loot...<br /><br />People.... the loot for each mob is already set before you kill it, having something in your inventory is not going to change what that mob drops. And it's definatly not going to increase your rolls.<br /><br />If it makes you feel better thinking that lucky charms actualy effect the game to your favor... go ahead... but wouldn't you think if these things really DID change the game so you got better loot/rolls, wouldn't EVERYONE carry one?</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
