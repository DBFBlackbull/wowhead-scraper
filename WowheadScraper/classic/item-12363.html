<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finding 2 in 1 vein is entirely possible. I've only had this happen to me once, but it did happen.<br /><br />As for finding them in general, it's not too hard.&nbsp; If I spend about 2 or 3 hours looking in Burning, Winterspring, and even Ungoro, I can usually find at least 2 with some luck.<br /><br />I've also found a few Azerothian Diamonds and Black Diamonds while mining for Arcane Crystals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok ppl, heres a little tip ive discovered on my own:<br /><br />Being a paly, I wanted the Energized breastplate until I can get Lawbringer. This means doing DM East runs. DM East takes 20-30 mins to complete if you have a good leader. (run from boss to boss, avoid all patrols)<br /><br />I went to DM East 10 times in a week with a group of guildies, often being the only miner, as you can only go 5 man. We did each run on 20 mins and went up to 3 times in a row (thats like 1 hour)&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally got the chestplate but thats beside the point..<br /><br />The point is that after you have killed Aldzin the Wildshaper you will have acces to a tunnel behind him, leading you to the exit of the instance. <br /><br />In this tunnel are 2 or 3 rich thorium veins.<br /><br />To my experience there are 1 Arcane Crystal in every 3rd vein. (frikkin 33% drop rate for me :D)<br /><br />Doing 10 runs, in a week, getting to mine about 12 veins in those runs, got me 4x Arcane Crystal, 2x Azerothian Diamond, 1x Large Opal.<br /><br />Do you want Arcanite?<br /><br />Do DM East.<br /><br />And while you there... grab a Libram of of Rapidity or Focus, and sell it for 250g, or get your class book and your Royal Seal. :) I *love* DM East :)<br /><br />(Best thing might be to form a group with 4 ppl from your guild, who you go with reguarly. Ppl are easilly persuaded if you mention that it will be a book farming run)<br /><br />Good luck all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I had farmed a bunch of rich thorium veins in Burnning steppes Winterspring and Un'Goro (Non Terror Run)....NO DROPS! The first RTV i Found in Terror Run dropped an AC. There is a reason that those elite Stegosaurs are there...to make it harder to mine! Im going to test the theory that Terror Run is more &quot;Rich&quot; than the rest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>thott says that one of these were found in yellow power crystal in un'goro, i always check yellow power crystals whenever I there, never anything, the only reliable source is farming every rich thorium vein you ever find in hopes of finding one. <br /><br />I've found 12 crystals, 2 star rubies, 2 large opals, and one azerothian diamond on various rich thorium veins. Personally I've mined at least 100 rich veins total.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I play on Alexstrasza and have noted a marked decrease in the value of these the first time I sold one, it went for 18g (a bit below the usual range to begin with), but nowadays they go for 1-2g apiece. Did they just become useless after a patch and nobody told me, or is this just a server-specific flaccidity? It's really a shame that they're still fairly rare but selling for so little.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol he got three of one and i have mined about 100 mines and havent even got 1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have mined maybe 6 or 7 rich thorium veins. 6 had no arcane, just thorium and dense stone. 7th one I get an arcane crystals, blue sapphire, and a huge emerald :) Not as lucky as 2 arcane crystals, but like I said =P Best luck yet.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes its very frustrating.I have noticed the price changes aswell and its sick. from 15-20 to 50g each chrystal. Just cause of naxx attunment and to hand in for their tier 3 parts. Think about thoose who wont be able to to that kind of end game?They have to get their gear on much cheaper and easier ways.So basicly for an ordinry not that good unguilded or guilded person wants to get an Arcanite reaper/Heartseeker etc etc? think he will pay over 2k gold for it?. he rahter die out there and stop playing the game cause he knows already that he dosnt put up for the standards, and thats Sad*Blizz Please do something about this noncence. Thats my opinion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>oh where oh where can I get these?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Un'Goro not only has better AC drop rates in my experience, it's a smaller area to cover since they really only consistently appear in Terror Run. It's easier to manage competition like this not to mention that with the exception of King Mosh which actually spawns in the Golakka Hot Springs and NOT in Terror Run, the highest level mob you will be threatened by is a lvl 55 Elder Diemetradon. All the other zones are chock full of 58+ mobs which make aggro a pain in the ass especially if you're under 60 <br /><br />-Nah-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got the recipe to transmute them today I just need to get my hands on the recipe for the stones...<br />so I asked a friend what those crystals go for he said 20G rougly.<br />checking AH I found one for 2G buyout while everything else was 17,5G buy out...<br />hoping I will find prices like this once every 2 days :p<br />but I'm guessing I wont :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I farm thorium on a daily basis for about 3-5 hours in EPL and WS and I've had the most luck in WS (9 crystals in about 3 hours once). Usually I end up with 1 crystal every 30 minutes, I'm not counting other gems. Some people have much worse luck with these so it won't always be that easy. Plus you have to work out a timer to steal veins from farmers (who seem to love WS on my server). It helps to have gatherer mod or CT mapmod for the veins until you learn spawn points by heart. The best vein in my experience is the one in the Owlkin Place in southern WS--I got 2 crystals out of one vein, two days in a row. But they all have a decent drop rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Imperious0212</b></h3>I think right now they are very rare to get, even from Rich Thoriums, I think they are nerfed more than ever.</div>

I did roughly 3 circuits of Un'goro hitting all the nodes. I got 8 Arcane crystals in that 3 circuits and 2 definitely came from small thorium deposits. Going by my results it shouldn't take more than about 30 minutes to get all 10 you need to make the sword. Your results may vary. Good luck and have fun!</div>
