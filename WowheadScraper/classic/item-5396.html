<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I recommend getting this item for all aliance people!<br /><br />Even when you arent going to do much in the searing gorge, this quest is worth it.<br /><br />After you killed the LVL48 Elite Kodo (without guards and such, he`s just alone) you get his horn.<br /><br />When you hand in the quest you get <b>5450 exp</b>, then you`ve to go to IF (Library), give the horn to some guy, <b>4400 exp</b>, and then you`ve to go back to that mountaineer and you receive the key to the S.G. �nd another <b>4400 exp</b>.<br /><br />That makes it <b>14250 experience in total</b> for just killing one beast!<br /><br />Greetz,<br /><br />LVL46 NE Hunter (Emerald Dream).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He is in Tanner Camp of Searing Gorge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im a collector nut and now that this new patch is out im trying to fill my keyring. I lost this key somehow and was wondering if theres a way to get it back? if so how?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got up in the corner of the door and used Eagle Eye to see exactly where the lever was (that opens the door) and then was able to click it while still using Eagle Eye.&nbsp; I couldn't see the lever without using Eagle Eye so I don't think other classes (except maybe shamans) can open it that way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can talk to guard Pebble something or other at Searing Gorge gate from Loch Modan. She tells you where to find mob to kill (48 elite super easy, I soloed as priest at level 50). You have to kill the lizzard, get the horn, The horn starts the quest, not the guard. You take her the horn, she thinks it's a fake, you go to IF and have the museum curator authenticate it, take certificate back to Guard/Pebble chicky at the gate, she gives you the key.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>guy in my horde guild has this key.. how odd</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The elite's cave is at 72,77 in Searing Gorge</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Like a previous poster said, if you're a hunter, just stand right by the lever on the loch modan side of the door, and use eagle eye on the ground about 2 feet in front of you. You should then be able to click on the lever, and it will let you through. I just did it, and it worked great.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can click the lever without being inside the tunnel (and without having to use farsight or eagle eye):<br /><br />Where to stand, and click: <a href="http://img238.imageshack.us/img238/2990/image2ts3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img238.imageshack.us/img238/2990/image2ts3.jpg </a><br />The door opened, with the key quest still available as proof that it's possible: <a href="http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/5309/image1tf1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/5309/image1tf1.jpg </a><br /><br />You can do the same thing with the SM doors, though you'll still need the key to get into the boss rooms.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Face melted...It was really easy, and no, i didn't heal (Shadow, remember?)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is indeed true one can open the searing gorge gate, by stand against the gate, as much on left side as possible, or a tad to the right from there, and then scan the area left of the gate, until you see your cursor change and you can open the gate, without key, and without being a rogue :)<br /><br />I solo'd the lvl 48 elite , and im a lvl 45 mage. How i did that: Start with Pyroblast, if it got resisted, i knew i would have a hard time killing the kodo, so in those cases i ran, and retried. I used +22 int buff, ice armor, and elixer of defence. No healing pots were used nor mana , but would be very handy.<br /><br />So i pyroblasted him, then fireball, fireblast. Counterspell his cast, start fireballing/blasting again, then when ur counterspell is ready again, cast CS, frost nova him, and blink away, run a bit, and i started up my Runecloth Bandage, which healed me back to full, this last part is crucial since i couldnt make it any other way. Goodluck to all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This key can be placed in the keyring; it is the only keyring key that Horde characters cannot obtain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i dont get this...<br />why would you want a key to get into searing gorge when the quest to get it starts in searing gorge?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Opens the gate from SW Loch Modan to Searing Gorge. By the time you get this key, you probably don't really need it anymore, as you're just using the flight paths.<br />There's a lot of running back and forth to get this key.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i know you get the quest from that guard at the loch but after getting this i think she tells you to go to the bad lands and this is where im stommped do i go through the horde compound or near the ogre compound?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Even if you rely use the key. do the quest. At level 44 I got 15,000 exp for a very easy quest.<br />Took a party to kill the mob then just a few flights and all done.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How Horda can go to searing gorge? Becouse this quest is only for Ally</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sylveonas</b></h3>You can still cheese your way through as horde by way of hunter (and probably shaman as well) by using Eagle Eye when standing against the gate. <br />Stand against the gate, cast <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=6197/eagle-eye">Eagle Eye</a> as far forward as you can without raising the target reticle above ground level - you can then position the camera to allow you to click the lever behind the door on the left side. <br /><br />I saw comments saying this didn't work, but it does. Took me a couple tries but works fine on 6/22/2022.<br /><br />(This shortcut is helpful for cutting some time off your journey to do the Midsummer fire quests as Badlands fire is on the far left of the map - cutting through Searing Gorge takes you right to it without a huge detour.)</div>
