The guild I run with has a zero-sum dkp system, and I was like 7th or 8th in line after all the warriors had a shot at it.&nbsp; So to start off I didn't roll over or outbid any fury warriors or anything like that.\n\nI currently have Dal'Rend's, and I've been second-guessing myself over accepting the MH.&nbsp; I crunched some numbers and basically what I came up with was, right now with the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's OH I'm in a bad place.&nbsp; I'll do more dps with the set bonus from Dal'Rend's.\n\nBut AFTER, if I get that offhand, my dps will skyrocket.&nbsp; I know my Sinister Strikes won't hit as hard.&nbsp; And pre-1.8 this sword would have been a joke.&nbsp; But thanks to the weapon standardization this set has become a viable option for sword rogues.&nbsp; Yeah, if you're running MC or above there's better, MUCH better, and you shouldn't waste your time on this.&nbsp; But I'm not running MC.&nbsp; I'm not even in a ZG-running guild, I just raid with them from time to time.\n\nThe white dps from this set beats out the Dal'Rends set; you can't argue that.&nbsp; You get more AP from the two blades, as well as the same amount of crit, and you get a nicer set bonus.&nbsp; And don't forget that extra attack will be proccing more often, as will poisons, since they are static % chances.&nbsp; So the only real question is, does the loss in Sinister Strike damage outweigh the gain in white dps?&nbsp; It does not, when you have both swords.&nbsp; I used a base of 653 AP since that's what I have with my current gear, and I'm assuming you have Sword Specialization maxed out as well as Dual-Wield Specialization.&nbsp; I'm also assuming you have a cheap +4 enchant on your swords.&nbsp; If you can afford better, well, it's not gonna change the results, it will just change the numbers.\n\nWhite DPS is calculated as (Attack power\/14)*weapon speed + weapon dps for mainhand.&nbsp; Multiply this total by .75 for the offhand when you have DW Spec.&nbsp; Add the two together for your total.\n\nThe Sinister Strike Damage at level 60 is calculated as Weapon Damage + (Attack Power\/14)*2.4 + 73.&nbsp; I did this twice, once assuming you \"roll\" the lowest possible for that weapon and once for the highest.&nbsp; When I give you a figure for SS dps I averaged the high and low together and divided by 4.&nbsp; I am also assuming you are spamming SS every 4 seconds (40 energy at 20 energy\/2 seconds).&nbsp; For easier calculations no finishing moves will be considered, but they all have static damage anyway except SnD which will only increase the white dps.\n\nThe total DPS is gonna be your White + your SS dps.\n\nDal'Rend's Arms add 54 attack power (50 set bonus +4 str on MH).&nbsp; This means you will have 707 AP.\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp; 163.9\nHigh Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 349.2\nLow Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 279.2\nAvg Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 314.2\nSinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 78.6\nTotal DPS:&nbsp; 242.5\n\nThe Twin Blades of the Hakkari add 68 attack power (28 on MH and 40 on OH).&nbsp; This means you will have 721 AP.\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp; 180.0\nHigh Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 310.6\nLow Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 259.6\nAverage Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 285.1\nSinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 71.3\nTotal DPS:&nbsp; 251.3\n\nWielding Warblade of the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge OH gives you 681 AP (28 AP from the MH and nothing from the OH)\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp; 169.8\nHigh Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 303.7\nLow Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 252.7\nAverage Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 2782\nSinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 69.6\nTotal DPS:&nbsp; 239.4\n\nThis of course is before armor.&nbsp; If you really wanna get into it you can calculate the extra attack procs and poison procs but I'm not going to.\n\nAs you can see, total dps the Hakkari blades win.&nbsp; However Dal'Rend's comes in second, which means that for now the MH has to go in the bank.&nbsp; If you have Dal'Rend's Main and Hakkari Offhand ... I dunno, this math all gave me enough of a headache so I'll leave it to someone else.&nbsp; I would imagine it would be better than the Dal'Rend's set because you are only losing 10 ap for a better blade.&nbsp; I would guess the Hakkari set would still beat it out but I don't have the numbers to back that up.","date":"2006-04-08T01:20:51-05:00","rating":21,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"MisterP58","importedSubject":"This set vs Dal'rend's for Combat Sword Rogues"},{"commentv2":1,"number":22,"id":2640708,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"First...

As well, not everyone has the luck to get Brutality Blade when they want it, and this set is really amazing. Flame me all you want kids, a sword rogue would benefit greatly from this set.

I typically roam on AV in a Festive Green Dress with my pimp hat on.\n\nNow, I don't want to take these over someone who will actually use these as an upgrade.  That is my only concern really.  I have a bunch of DKP and the only thing I've used it on was the heart of hakkar. Most other people in my guild aren't even mentioning this set and are looking for the polearm from Mandokir, the bow, destroyer of worlds and so on.  We will be starting MC and Ony in the next few weeks and others are aiming for loot these.  I have stamped bloodletter and BB as my next to main upgrades and general play things, with the AQ Ripper in the distant future.\n\nBut at present, these are within reach now.  I've considered more and more because I've come across posts by other rogues who have the blades and make a sound argument for using them.  These arguements have mentioned the set bonus which I would want, and the other all speed for SnD with poison application speeding up for the MH.  I currently lead the Raids with Dal'rends in my main or the Ravenholdt Slicer or both equpped.  ( I have a bunch of swords I switch out just for fun, including felstriker ).  However during boss fights, I slow down on SS because I like to stay very low on the threatmeter.  And I can potientally see these being a plus in that situation cause I want to spam SS a bit more.\n\nI'm basically looking for sound arguements.  No, \"ur teh n00b\" and so on comments.  Its a game and everyone was a noob at one point, and I'm learning how to make my toon better and\/or enjoy the game more.  I can't test it out and then give them back :\\\n\nThen of course there is thekal's claw set, which I would use for fun on BGs :)\n\n[i][small]Edited, Jul  7th  2006 at  1:05pm EDT by Kracus[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-07-07T17:02:56-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Kracus","importedSubject":"Endless game"},{"commentv2":1,"number":120,"id":3078887,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Dude these were made for Fury Warriors.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>871</b></h3>This is also pretty good for hunter, especially then when your guild's melee DPS doesn't want it anymore because of can have much better swords from BWL, AQ40 and Naxx.<br /><br />I'm at the moment wearing this and Core Hound Tooth on my hunter, but still trying to get Silithid Claw from Sartura and Fang of the Faceless from Hakkar, because they're slightly better. Ofc they're only micro-upgrade as in together they would only give +10 AP more, but it is still something. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5474</b></h3>For Hunters this can be replaced in AQ40 with Silithid Claw which is only 2 ap extra. Hatchet of Sundered Bone from Naxx is one-hand so could replace your warblade or whatever you off-hand is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4956</b></h3>This weapon for rogues is 100% terrible if you plan on actively using sinister strike or hemo as a portition of your damage. The base and high end damage make it absolutely terrible for instant attacks in general. The speed kills any hope for hemorrage damage as hemorrage isn't normalized.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xeenon</b></h3>While hunters should have priority on the mainhand sword, with a speed combat build and some talents that improves poisons this set is absolutely destructive for a PvP rogue playing with a decent team.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheDood</b></h3>Depending on your playstyle, this can be one of the best MH weapons you can get for a fury DW warrior. For PvE it isn't too great, a slow speed means your HS will hit for more, and that is crucial as you, in plate, will be topping the aggro charts just below the the MT, so those silly rogues or clothies wont be taking any. For PvP, it some like a slower MH for HS crits and overpowers but a faster speed is vastly different playstyle which I have been meaning to experiment with.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3>It depends on your ability's to play. I got both a 60 warrior and hunter and a rogue as well. This is surely a great MH for a hunter<br />28 AP = +/- 28 agility for a hunter, And the 1 % crit is pretty nice as well. For a fury DW warrior it is a bit slow for a Main hand, if you are a fury warrior you should try to get the off hand from the set, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17068">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17068</a> (Deathbringer) that's a very nice combo imo. For rogues it's pretty nice but I would prefer Brutality blade in main hand because the stats are a bit better, and so is the DPS. If you are not in MC the Warblade of Hakkari is a very nice main hand. And of course if you can get the offhand it's a very big +++. Hunters and Rogues should get prio on this weapon, fury warriors should go for another weapon like <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19103">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19103</a> (Frostbite) (Horde) Same stats but a mace if you are alliance. If your guild killed Onyxia Deathbringer would be better, but Frostbite is pretty solid and cool until you are in MC/Onyxia with your guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7359</b></h3>I fail to see why rogues and hunters would get priority, the MH is extremely fast, got tons of ap, crit, and the +swords is just godly.<br /><br />its a warrior weapon as much as it is anyone elses.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7543</b></h3>Rogues are the worst possible class to get this item, if I see this weapon in the hands of anyone besides a warrior or hunter, it automatically tells me that they are a horrible player and know almost nothing about the mechanics of their class. My original main is a rogue with almost 100 days /played with every spec imaginable, and even the heaviest combat build is reliant on a large percentage of SS damage, which a 1.7 speed weapon would totally gimp.<br /><br />I'm serious, please uninstall wow right now and go back to playing hello kitty island adventure.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7700</b></h3>Amazing fury warrior weapon set. High end damage doesn't matter for a fury warrior because they are based on low amounts of burst damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7735</b></h3>Before normalization this would probably not be too good for a rogue, but now since attack power is normalized, you will still do fine with it, even if you sinister strikes wont be quite as big.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7833</b></h3>I think the set was designed more for hunters than anything...Survival hunters that is. For Rogues still weilding a Heartseeker or Lobotomizer it would be a decent upgrade as well with the right enchants placed on it. But I honestly have only ever seen hunters use the set and ver few if any Rogues and Warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8976</b></h3>Jesyr77, The hakkari warblade main hand isn't &quot;very good&quot; for a rogue thats true, but stop acting like that. You can take a look at wowloot.com it's 3 stars for a rogue, so it isn't terrible. Yes there are better available weapons than this, but it's fine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The main hand's speed is also 1.7, which a rogue would never go for.<br /><br />That leaves hunter and fury warrior.<br /><br />I'd personally rather be the owner of the set (fury warrior) and leave the MC weapon drops to the rogues.&nbsp; As for hunters, this is only a bit better for them than Dal'Rend's, and they wouldn't make use of the set bonus.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I�ll ignore the stupid 2-3 last posts and comment on some of the more intelligent further up..<br /><br />Although speed shouldnt be taken into account with the new instant attack game mechanichs (after 1.8) it doesnt meen a low max dam, high dps sword will be good for a rogues SS damage.<br /><br />Sinister Strike still does damage according to damage range (high max sword damage = high sinister strike damage) although the speed has been fixed to 2.4 speed after patch 1.8.<br /><br />For Sinister Strike I believe the formula is:<br />Weapon damage+((AP/14)*speed+SS bonus <br />Weapon damage+((AP/14)*2.4)+68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Lets compare Krol to Warblade.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm an experienced fury warrior. with the right gear fury warrior can do very well in DPS compare to MS warrior and rogues. The problem with fury is that a lot of ppl dont know how to spec it, what to do, and what to wear.&nbsp; Fury gears are very limited as well. In fact half of the best fury gears aren't even epics. This sword is by far, the best Mainhand weapon for an experienced fury warrior. For our mainhand we want a weapon as fast as possible to generate rage and better proc rate, but not a dagger b/c of the new normalize instant attack where daggers only get 1.7 speed of damage from AP, whereas 1h swords and axes get 2.4 speed from AP for our overpower and execute. By far, this is the best 1h sword/axe available to us, so for a hunter to roll for this over a fury warrior in their guild just so he can put an extra 15agility at the cost of perhaps the best weapon for the fury warrior makes me sick to my stomach.&nbsp; If i were the leader of the guild i'd make sure the hunter understand this, and if he doesnt i'd ask him politely to leave the guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The offhand is great for any rogue because the ap bonus.&nbsp; But, these swords would work fine for a sword specced combat rogue also.&nbsp; Even though your SS would be a bit soft you'd get a huge bonus from flat % based procs.&nbsp; IIP procs 30% for 130 damage, sword spec 6% for extra attack, HoJ 2% for extra attack.&nbsp; The speed will help proc those and make up for the yellow damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, first off lemme say I'm a Rogue, and I use swords in PvE for the sustained DPS and daggers in PvP for the burst dps.<br /><br />Anyone that says I would &quot;roll&quot; for this item is a retard because you don't roll in ZG, and those people should be disregarded.<br /><br />I can see how it would be easy to think this is a rogue set, but it's reallyl not that good for rogues. Sure you'll proc poison more often, or maybe get your extra swing more frequently, but the white damage on this is negigable and if you were going for that stuff a dagger with windfury would do the same white damage, probably more poison procs dual wielding daggers than this set. I'd take Dal'Rend's over these, because honestly I lose damage in a long fight because my SS hits are MUCH&nbsp; lower.<br /><br />Now, technically this would be a great weapon for a fury warrior in PvP, but in my guild, since we just started doing ZG and MC, we make PvE items a priority over PvP items. Meaning if you wanted a sword or item purely for PvP, you wouldn't get it if someone else could use it for PvE. So we'd give these to our hunters. Hunters do melee in some fights, especially against the spider boss because you gotta stay close to the spider, and also because the stats on these babies give the same things it does for rogues: increased crit chance, attack power boost.<br /><br />Now I'm going to compare this w/ Dal'Rend's Arms.<br />Dal'Rends: You get 54 AP (4 more ap from 4 str, rogues only get 1 ap per 1 str), +7 defense +100 armor (good if you pull aggro a lot), and +1% crit. <br />Hakkari: 68 AP, 1% crit, and swords +6.<br /><br />Hakkari only gives 14 more AP, which is negigable, and the swords +6 is nice, but not enough to make it an ideal rogue set. I cannot stress this enough, Hakkari does MUCH less SS damage, making this a BAD rogue set. Rogues, do the right thing. Give this to your hunter or fury war, they can do a lot more with this than you can.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;What would a Hunter do with +6 swords.&quot;<br /><br />Dude, look at any epic Hunter set.&nbsp; They are almost always given worthless set bonuses.&nbsp; The stats are great though from the weapons themself ignoring the set bonus..the normal deal for Hunters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These weapons are not a class weapon it benefits combat rogues any hunter and fury warriors i see no prob if any of those are sought after by those classes plus i mean if those drop its not a roll situation more like a dkp situation so if u have more dkp u deserve it more i dont care if yer a mage i want these for the crit chance attk power +6 to swords doesnt mean crap to me but if i pound +15 agility on both they will be awesome on my hunter those are the only things im going for in zg so i think i got a good chance gettin em im willing to waste all my dkp on them but if a rogue or fury war out dkp's me i wont have a prob and i wont say u noobs i mean how could u say that +6 sword to fury or combat rogue is good +1% crit chance is also good so is attk power if anything these sword or more beneficial to a rogue or fury war lol so quit wasting time saying HUNTER WEAPONx10000000 just start doing zg and get em</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a combat sword rogue, 20/31/0, and I just got the MH today.&nbsp; The guild I run with has a zero-sum dkp system, and I was like 7th or 8th in line after all the warriors had a shot at it.&nbsp; So to start off I didn't roll over or outbid any fury warriors or anything like that.<br /><br />I currently have Dal'Rend's, and I've been second-guessing myself over accepting the MH.&nbsp; I crunched some numbers and basically what I came up with was, right now with the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's OH I'm in a bad place.&nbsp; I'll do more dps with the set bonus from Dal'Rend's.<br /><br />But AFTER, if I get that offhand, my dps will skyrocket.&nbsp; I know my Sinister Strikes won't hit as hard.&nbsp; And pre-1.8 this sword would have been a joke.&nbsp; But thanks to the weapon standardization this set has become a viable option for sword rogues.&nbsp; Yeah, if you're running MC or above there's better, MUCH better, and you shouldn't waste your time on this.&nbsp; But I'm not running MC.&nbsp; I'm not even in a ZG-running guild, I just raid with them from time to time.<br /><br />The white dps from this set beats out the Dal'Rends set; you can't argue that.&nbsp; You get more AP from the two blades, as well as the same amount of crit, and you get a nicer set bonus.&nbsp; And don't forget that extra attack will be proccing more often, as will poisons, since they are static % chances.&nbsp; So the only real question is, does the loss in Sinister Strike damage outweigh the gain in white dps?&nbsp; It does not, when you have both swords.&nbsp; I used a base of 653 AP since that's what I have with my current gear, and I'm assuming you have Sword Specialization maxed out as well as Dual-Wield Specialization.&nbsp; I'm also assuming you have a cheap +4 enchant on your swords.&nbsp; If you can afford better, well, it's not gonna change the results, it will just change the numbers.<br /><br />White DPS is calculated as (Attack power/14)*weapon speed + weapon dps for mainhand.&nbsp; Multiply this total by .75 for the offhand when you have DW Spec.&nbsp; Add the two together for your total.<br /><br />The Sinister Strike Damage at level 60 is calculated as Weapon Damage + (Attack Power/14)*2.4 + 73.&nbsp; I did this twice, once assuming you &quot;roll&quot; the lowest possible for that weapon and once for the highest.&nbsp; When I give you a figure for SS dps I averaged the high and low together and divided by 4.&nbsp; I am also assuming you are spamming SS every 4 seconds (40 energy at 20 energy/2 seconds).&nbsp; For easier calculations no finishing moves will be considered, but they all have static damage anyway except SnD which will only increase the white dps.<br /><br />The total DPS is gonna be your White + your SS dps.<br /><br />Dal'Rend's Arms add 54 attack power (50 set bonus +4 str on MH).&nbsp; This means you will have 707 AP.<br /><br />White DPS:&nbsp; 163.9<br />High Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 349.2<br />Low Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 279.2<br />Avg Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 314.2<br />Sinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 78.6<br />Total DPS:&nbsp; 242.5<br /><br />The Twin Blades of the Hakkari add 68 attack power (28 on MH and 40 on OH).&nbsp; This means you will have 721 AP.<br /><br />White DPS:&nbsp; 180.0<br />High Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 310.6<br />Low Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 259.6<br />Average Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 285.1<br />Sinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 71.3<br />Total DPS:&nbsp; 251.3<br /><br />Wielding Warblade of the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge OH gives you 681 AP (28 AP from the MH and nothing from the OH)<br /><br />White DPS:&nbsp; 169.8<br />High Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 303.7<br />Low Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 252.7<br />Average Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 2782<br />Sinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 69.6<br />Total DPS:&nbsp; 239.4<br /><br />This of course is before armor.&nbsp; If you really wanna get into it you can calculate the extra attack procs and poison procs but I'm not going to.<br /><br />As you can see, total dps the Hakkari blades win.&nbsp; However Dal'Rend's comes in second, which means that for now the MH has to go in the bank.&nbsp; If you have Dal'Rend's Main and Hakkari Offhand ... I dunno, this math all gave me enough of a headache so I'll leave it to someone else.&nbsp; I would imagine it would be better than the Dal'Rend's set because you are only losing 10 ap for a better blade.&nbsp; I would guess the Hakkari set would still beat it out but I don't have the numbers to back that up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First... I hate to break it to you guys, but a number of guilds, mine included, do not use DKP for 20 man instances.&nbsp; DKP is only used in MC/BWL for us, so yes, we DO in fact &quot;roll&quot; for items in ZG/AQ20... maybe next time you should have a little more vision before tossing the &quot;n00b&quot; comments out eh?<br /><br />Secondly, I could see why rogues/fury warriors would want these.&nbsp; I wouldn't argue them rolling on it at all.&nbsp; Yes there are better weapons out there... it's ZG... it's NOT one of the top instances.<br /><br />The primary reason why a hunter would want these blades has ZERO to do w/ the +6 swords.<br /><br />w/ +15 agil on both, a hunter would be pulling 128Ranged AP, and 1% to crit.&nbsp; These stats are comperable to many pairs of 1h weapons in MC/BWL for us.&nbsp; In PvP, I'd rather keep a 2h on for the larger raptor crits ect, but in raids we want the most Ranged AP we can get, and the 1% crit is just as helpful.<br /><br />There are easily better weapons out there for Fury Warriors and Rogues, but OMG they might not have access to those items (especially if thier guild is still using DKP in ZG....think about it)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I really feel like there are much better choices for Combat sword rogues out there then the main hand, however, concerning the offhand, the DPS, attack speed, and +ap are incredible for a lowbie combat rogue like me.&nbsp; I would never take the main hand from a fury warrior/ hunter, however, this off hand is a great alternitive if you dont have access to MUCH higer items, or, dont have the dal rends set (i use sword of zeal and this now).<br /><br />I almost feel that the fast attack speed and major dps would be wasted on a hunter, but, the +40 attack power is godly, so, roll away :D<br /><br />Moe.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>tell u what:<br /><br />this set is one of the best PvE equip u find for a hunter! there is absolutely no doubt about it.<br />it might even be better than anything that drops in MC - which is the brutality blade and the corehound tooth!<br /><br />taking the hakkari off and mixing it with the stuff from MC, u will see that the hakkari main is still the better choice for any hunter thue to higher RAP u get from the set!<br />mixing the MC drops with the main-hand will still give u more benefits than the MC-combo.<br />brutality and corehound tooth in combination gives a hunter (+15 agi enchant included) 98 RAP and 2,741% to crit. thats 30 RAP less than this set but 1,171% more crit.<br /><br />i personally prefer the higher RAP for raids since my crit is already pretty high and i hate FD spamming all the time not to take the aggro off of our MTs.<br />for PvP i'd prefer the MC combination but who is using dualwield in PvP when one is looking for high raptor crits!&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />anyway - this set is awesome for a hunter and as mentioned above, the main seems not to be a good choice for rouges. and i do not know any fury-warrior in my guild........<br />so i got the off-hand and looking hard now to get the main-hand!&nbsp; ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You guys are trying to compare things on the flat numbers of the items. You really have to understand how these items will be enchanted to get the full benefit.<br /><br />Fury Warrior - 15 str on each to maximize Bloodthirst. Or 15 str on off hand and +5 damage on main for more white.<br /><br />dual 15's = +58 AP main and +70 AP off with 1% crit<br />15 str/5 dam = +70 off and 52.7 DPS main with +28 AP, 1% crit<br /><br />Rogue - 15 agi on each or 15 agi off and +5 damage on main.<br /><br />dual 15's = +58 AP main and +70 AP off with 2.2% crit<br />15 agi/5 damage = +70 AP off and 52.7 DPS main with +28 AP, 1.75% crit<br /><br />Hunter - Only option is +15 agi on both<br /><br />dual 15's = +58 RAP main (+43 melee) and +70 RAP off (+55 melee), 1.55% crit<br /><br />due to class mechanics I listed them in the order of priority. Furry warriors would get the most sustained DPS out of the set. Rogues are second and hunters are third.<br /><br />Hunters score third due to the new +25 agi to 2 hand enchant. Look at the total number of AP from the set. It's +68 and 1% crit with 60 added from dual 15's agi enchant. Now look at Barbarous Blade which is +60 AP and 1% crit with 50 added from +25 agi enchant. So that makes a blue almost equal in value to a hunter as this purple set which would be huge upgrades to warriors and hunters. All a hunter gains by getting these 2 purples is 18 AP over an easy to get blue from Dire Maul. <br /><br />Learn to itemize.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Not sure if this has been mentioned, but +6 swords also increases your crit chance and chance to hit.<br />The formula is simple, 0.04% each skill point.<br /><br />So the set gives a total of 1.24% crit and 0.24% chance to hit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The off hand is great for a rogue. The main hand is great for a hunter. The set is great for a fury warrior.<br /><br />The off hand: as a rogue, I have to find 40 agi to get 40 AP. Hunters only need to find 20 AGI to get the same. Every single attack I make will be made with this sword, to a hunter its a stat item.<br /><br />The main hand: not enough on the top end for a rogue... but for a hunter 1% crit is good, throw in a bit of AP, and the fact that speed and top end don't matter, nice stuff.<br /><br />Fury warriors however get the best use from the set. +6 swords reduces your chance of 'Glancing Blows', increasing your dps by a significant margin against higher level mobs. Th AP and crit doesn't hurt either, or the insane speed on the main hand.<br /><br />And to those who think there are soooo many other viable choices out there...<br /><br />Pre BWL there are exactly FOUR epic sword drops for melee classes. THREE of these have a less than&nbsp; 5% drop rate.<br /><br />Onyxia has Vis'Kag (4% or so)<br />AQ 20 has nothing (go figure...)<br />MC has Brutality (13% or so)<br />ZG has this set (4-5% on each one)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This blade, and the offhand, both drop in ZG.&nbsp; This blade drops off Hakkar (the final boss) and the offhand drops off of Bloodlord Mandokir.&nbsp; I picked this blade up with my hunter a few weeks back, and i love it.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to getting Fang of the Faceless, as the mainhand hakkari/Fotf is one of the best combos available to hunters pre naxx.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as the rogue vs. hunter thing, this weapon could go either way if your guild cannot do MC.&nbsp; If your guild can do MC or BWL, i think this weapon is better for hunters, as the stats are just too good to pass up, and there are far better weapons for rogue damage in MC.&nbsp; The offhand kinda blows for hunters, and should prolly go to rogues or fury warriors in most cases.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, that's how my guild seems to be geared, all of the mainhand blades are on the hunters, and all of the offhands are on the rogues.<br /><br />oh, and btw..i'm not sure on the specific lvl for ZG, but i have seen 58's or so goin in there, but most guilds wont take you unless you are lvl 60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>honestly, these r pretty much the best weapons a hunter can possibly get before barb of the sand reaver, believe it or not. And no, not for pvp as some nub stated above, but for pve. With 2x 15 agi enchants they will give u ~1.5% crit and 112 AP. Tell me, which combo is better?<br />Some of u may say its better to get agi than ap as a hunter cus of LR. Well, speccing LR before u have ~450-500 unbuffed agi is stupid, as TSA + ranged weapon spec will give u a lot more dmg. And no, u wont have that much agi when ure doing ZG...<br /><br />All this from a raid perspective ofc, for pvp i'd definitely go for some big 2 hander for those raptor strikes :&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This set is great for hunters for the stats. If your guild is running it it's definatly worth the DKP I think (as everyone else has posted) we can agree.<br /><br />As for if this is a great rogue set? Well hell yes it is. Yes your SS will take a little hit compared to most sword you'll get if your raiding ZG.. but there's more to a combat rogue than SS. With the great attack speed to start with, factor in Blade fury and slice and dice, you're looking at crazy attack speed. What does this mean? Incredibly more chances to apply posions, which means crazy dps. If you can hit 10 times in 10 seconds you're a pwner.<br /><br />Further more, if you're a human rogue with +5 swords, +5 to swords/fist/dagger talent, and the +6 to swords with the set bonus, you're looking at 316 to swords which is leet.<br /><br />Completly worth the rogue's DKP (pending that you're not running MC or BWL yet) and you're a fool if you think otherwise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What i hate most about these swords are the fact that they are good for so many. Rogues can make great use of these but imo they are way to fast, atlest the main hand, so it wont get any hit SS hits/crits. Great for Fury Warriors thanks to the speed scince Unriddled Wrath will proc a lot with thses giving a great rage bonus, and the crit and AP is superior to Hunters. I would say a Fury Warrior would benefit most from those, but then again im playing a fury warrior....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Speed 1.70 on a sword for Rogue ? come on man wake upp or lose dps !<br /><br />Now I'm going to compare this w/ Dal'Rend's Arms. <br />Dal'Rends: You get 54 AP (4 more ap from 4 str, rogues only get 1 ap per 1 str), +7 defense +100 armor (good if you pull aggro a lot), and +1% crit. <br />Hakkari: 68 AP, 1% crit, and swords +6. <br /><br />Hakkari only gives 14 more AP, which is negigable, and the swords +6 is nice, but not enough to make it an ideal rogue set. I cannot stress this enough, Hakkari does MUCH less SS damage, making this a BAD rogue set. Rogues, do the right thing. Give this to your hunter or fury war, they can do a lot more with this than you can. <br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 14th 2006 at 7:46am EDT by Banakar</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Since the new patch lots of paladins want fast weapons to go with Blessing of wisdom/light. Thats me too, but I wouldnt roll on this one (the main hand offcourse) though. Let the warriors, hunters and rogues have it. <br />I know a lot of pali's who would roll on stuff like this. Thats great if no one else wants it (cant imagine the day that would happen). In my opinion, if you want to deal lots of dammage and get swords like these, play those other three classes. I like to play a walking fortress with near infinite mana ;-)<br />And if you want speed, buy a hanzo sword or something...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Im one of the few Fury warriors lucky enough to have the complete set, and all i can say is it completely owns in raids. Im usually in the Top 3 dmg of all the raids we do overall, and pretty high on the list for all boss encounters. As fury is a build very dependant on exactly what your using as weapons, it pays to have ones as good as these. Ive tried slow main hand and fast off, and never fast/fast, but it works like a charm in any situation. All i can say is if your fury and get the chance to have these go for it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I want these swords :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Instead of multiplying by the speed of the weapon, the attack power bonus will be multiplied by a fixed number pulled from the following table:<br /><br />Two-handed weapons: 3.3<br />Daggers: 1.7<br />All other one-handed weapons: 2.4<br /><br />As a direct result of this, many weapons will shift position in their relative power. In particular, many epic (purple) quality items will now be more powerful than slower superior (blue) weapons. For the purpose of instant attacks, the Arcanite Reaper and the Barman Shanker will drop slightly in relative power, while Typhoon and Alcor’s Sunrazor will increase in power. <br /><br />roll on them now if you don't have better dps swords and bank them till 1.8</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i would like to say something here to clear this up for you kiddies out there. the set gives you a total of 68 atk pwr and 1% chance to crit. that is great by its self. With two +15 agi enchants it brings it up to a grand total of 128 atk pwr and 1.56% chance to crit. That my friends is the best set that a hunter can get outta any one weapon or weapon set. Also 1.7 attack speed is a little fast for you rogues out there for your ss, evis combo.</div>

ALL MELEE sucks now. Its so sad to see such a great game do something so stupid like this to ruin it 4 all (melee), it was almost unbelievable when i saw what they had done. <br /><br />I have the Empyrean Demolisher it was the best sinister strike weapon on the game other than pvp reward weapons that is, and now has become a P.O.S. Even pvp reward weapons are trash now b/c they are 2 slow between sinister strike half of the beauty was the slow speed bouns, and now the only thing good about them is the high dps. Faster weapons are the best now b/c all weapons are locked on the same speed for the special moves SO GHEY. <br /><br />THERE IS NO DEPTH TO THE GAME ANYMORE <br /><br />So bottom line is we will never hit the high crits and dps like we once did this is such BS. Today was a sad day =*( <br /><br />world of warcraft can kiss my _ _ _ guess its back to DAoC 4 me. <br /><br />When i say no DEPTH i mean on weapon selection. All anyone is going to try 4 now is the fastest weapon they can get their hands on to only come up short of what we once did. B4 if u were another class u would want the fast weapon like a hunter now we will all be going for the fast weapons with the most dps and the slow ones have no use. The slow speed bonus is no more that means no DEPTH and we have been GIMPED. plz dont be a sheep stand up 4 something. We did not deserve a nerf of any sort we already were <b>not</b> the damage dealers (ROGUES) as we were suppose to be as defined in the book. <br /><br />In conclusion BLIZZARD should have fixed the blue weapons that were causing the prob and left the system how it was. <br /><br />Edited, Fri Nov 4 12:54:58 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I view this set as an upgrade set from the Dal'Rends blades. The Warblades of the Hakkari are great for almost everyone. Hunters can benefit hugely from the +68 atp and crit chance, not so much the +6 swords but meh.. Fury warriors probably do benefit more than rogues from the set as a whole. Sword rogues depend pretty heavily on the damage from their SS while enemies are stunlocked, which is the reason why we need a slower mainhand.<br /><br />That having been said, I still want these blades on my rogue. Not because I'm a greedy ninja epic-%^&amp;*!, but because I like to play the game a certain way, I do not create cookie-cutter avatars, and these swords combined with Adrenaline rush and blade flurry+SnD along with my base crit chance would be AMAZING.<br /><br />Yes, a slower mainhand creates more damage on crit ss and gs, bf and so forth. But the speed on these combined with the very nice DPS would make them unbelievable for PvE combat. As well, not everyone has the luck to get Brutality Blade when they want it, and this set is really amazing. Flame me all you want kids, a sword rogue would benefit greatly from this set. If it's pug, roll away, if it's not, foreward it to your fury warriors. If it's up in the air, grab it. You won't regret it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>have set as a rogue on Kilrogg. since sword for ss are standardized at 2.40 I don't see how it matters anymore. I'm dealing more damage with this baby as mh then when I used Empyrean with a 23/2/26 build and then I used hemo both in pvp and pve dealed more dmg then ss and costed less energy whichbasicly used it for. And hemo never sufferd from the standardisation which means it dill does good dps with slow weps ie empyrean.<br /><br />Now that I got this set I went back to my old combat sword build 20/31, and damn because of the speed the sword spec proc goes off all the time. I don't really care about the low ss damage the base of the build is not to deal high burst dps but sustained long term dps.<br /><br />They're imo too slow for fury wars, I'd want 1.5 or less if I was fury dw distractig. Just to generate extra rage for hs spam.<br /><br />This is my argumen obviously this is not a rogue pvp set but damn it's sweet in pve.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With our first downing of Hakkar, and the lack of items in ZG that I'm really interested in, the MH has become more and more of my focus as a Rogue. However, having previously decided that I wasn't even going to bother I'm trying to do my homework and make the best decision I can.<br /><br />First off, its a game, these are cool lookin swords and so who cares what you use. Just play. As a rogue in PvP situations, having crappy weapons can still win you the fight no matter what. I typically roam on AV in a Festive Green Dress with my pimp hat on.<br /><br />Now, I don't want to take these over someone who will actually use these as an upgrade. That is my only concern really. I have a bunch of DKP and the only thing I've used it on was the heart of hakkar. Most other people in my guild aren't even mentioning this set and are looking for the polearm from Mandokir, the bow, destroyer of worlds and so on. We will be starting MC and Ony in the next few weeks and others are aiming for loot these. I have stamped bloodletter and BB as my next to main upgrades and general play things, with the AQ Ripper in the distant future.<br /><br />But at present, these are within reach now. I've considered more and more because I've come across posts by other rogues who have the blades and make a sound argument for using them. These arguements have mentioned the set bonus which I would want, and the other all speed for SnD with poison application speeding up for the MH. I currently lead the Raids with Dal'rends in my main or the Ravenholdt Slicer or both equpped. ( I have a bunch of swords I switch out just for fun, including felstriker ). However during boss fights, I slow down on SS because I like to stay very low on the threatmeter. And I can potientally see these being a plus in that situation cause I want to spam SS a bit more.<br /><br />I'm basically looking for sound arguements. No, &quot;ur teh n00b&quot; and so on comments. Its a game and everyone was a noob at one point, and I'm learning how to make my toon better and/or enjoy the game more. I can't test it out and then give them back :\<br /><br />Then of course there is thekal's claw set, which I would use for fun on BGs :)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 7th 2006 at 1:05pm EDT by Kracus</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have these 2 babies, and they hit like a freight train. Sinister are around 500-700 instead of heavy weaps 700-900, but I can outdmg the other rogues in guild in mc cause of the extreme fast dmg.<br /><br />Face to face meele with fury warriors, no stuns, just adre rush, evasion and blade furry, 1 cp slice ... = dead warrior :)<br /><br />For those who dont know, they made your instant attacks hit with speed 2.4 so it doesnt matter if you have 1.7 or 2.8 :) <br /><br />I love these weaps, and never gotten so many tells before hehe, makes u popular :P ( first on server to have the set /flex )<br /><br />posting pic later :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">the main hand is useless to a rogue its too slow to be used to spam SS my Lobo hits harder than that sword these are obviously for fury warriors i wouldnt even want the MH the OH isnt bad though 40ATP is nice. Noob rogues would want that MH wep</div><br /><br />If only people like you would use proper grammar. Punctuation you retard! /SLAP<br /><br />and no, the main hand is PRETTY DAMN AWESOME for a rogue, not ALL rogues are dagger specced you f*cktard; use your miniscule brain please.<br />and not everyone is on a server where you can GET to Exalted with Stormpike/Frostwolf 'cause AV is never open. THINK you assface.<br /><br />Ohh, nearly forgot: I'll take them BOTH if I want to, the bonus helps a sword rogue equally as good as a warrior.. No go play with yourself kiddo; and leave the real comments to the players who can use them.<br /><i>(Not saying you can all use this; but his comment pissed me off... Like it or deal with it.)</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This combined with Doom's Edge or DFB from BWL (the latter being harder to get since Rogues will prob want it =) gives 120 AP and about 1.8% crit(1% crit from the sword + 46 agi's worth of crit which is about 1.8-1.85 (53 agi = 1 crit for a hunter)). <br /><br />Also nice is this + Fang of the Faceless.<br />2 crit/56 AP off the weapons themselves, +30 agi's worth of crit/AP = 0.6 crit/60 AP, so 2.6 crit/116 AP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>boy would i love them. im respecing my warrior 2 fury due 2 the fact we have enough tanks so watch out dps classes here i come! ... that is if i get them *dreaming*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My Warrior (Fury of course) would love these.<br /><br />They do pretty solid dps, add +hit (only a bit but who cares) and best of all: they look great!<br /><br />Being the only fury warrior in my Zul group I'll probably get them first, allthough I can see the benefits a hunter gets out of these.<br /><br />Then on the other hand we all get along pretty well and as the melees stay away from ranged weapons our hunters repay the favor by passing on melee weapons until we are properly equiped.<br /><br />Oh, we only do 20 man instances - so no brutality blade or better for us.<br /><br />P.S. In PvP the Rend swords can get pretty close if your playstyle is a certain way. The Hakkari swords and whirlwind just don't fit. but who needs Whirlwind as a fury warrior...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>my opinion... set for Fury Warrior, rogues use swords/daggers with low speeds and more dps, cuz Rogues do instant dmg, warriors require weapons with speed...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I see alot of hunters with this, should hunters need this? or when should a hunter need this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The set bonus is +6 to swords</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>at first glance reading through the stats for the weapons and the set as a rogue you think &quot;wow this is clearly designed with melees / rogues in mind&quot; then you look at the mainhand weapon speed of 1.7 and you think &quot;wow way to totally bork a great set of weapons&quot;<br /><br />as a rogue, I'd pass on this, even though I'd just like to wield something new.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are level 49 blues with better max damage than this mainhand. This is a set clearly intended for a DW Fury Warrior. Main hand is also quite good for a tanking Warrior.<br /><br />And Hunters keep your hands off all epic melee weapons except your quest staff, kthx</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the main hand is useless to a rogue its too slow to be used to spam SS my Lobo hits harder than that sword these are obviously for fury warriors i wouldnt even want the MH the OH isnt bad though 40ATP is nice.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i thought that you could only have one unique item equiped at a time...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I recently got the set from ZG and I love it.<br /><br />I am 20/31/0 and do almost nothing but raids. In my guild we have several other combat rogues with the bwl CTS and combinations on the brute blade and ony sword. That being said, with the totem from BWL, the 3 piece set bonus from Bloodfang armor, instant poison, slice and dice, and blade flurry makes me a happy rogue.<br /><br />This set continues to let me lead in damage on large boss fights and overall in instances.<br /><br />On the age old class priority argument, my guild has a warrior with the set as well and a hunter with the main hand. Its been discussed that it works for any melee class that is specced for it.<br /><br />Plus the duel glowing back sword thing is a nice graphic.<br /><br />I would also propose that a rogue using the set gains some utility for zerg encounters, as the fast attacks let me pull loose mobs back to the AE pile.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>every weapon on this website has some1 screaming that it's a hunter weapon wtf ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With blade flurry/slice and dice you're looking at 10 hits in 10 seconds.. tons of posion application and tons of procs. This is definiatly a good rogue set. Also good for hunters. But definatly a good rogue set. Especially if you're a human rogue. +5 human/+5 weapon talent/+6 set bonus = 316 to swords. (leet) P.S what's the best enchant for this weapon if you're a rogue? +5 damage for more SS?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AmazedWasTaken</b></h3>not sure if this is worth 900$</div>
