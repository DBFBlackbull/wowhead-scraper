The mages are cheering and spamming 'Yes!' and I pipe up and say 'Oooo, look at the stats on that, i want to roll!'\n\nMages reaction? 'NO, NINJA IF YOU ROLL! ITS FOR MAGES'. So I link my current shoulders and say 'But its an upgrade.. and its cloth, any class that can use should be able to roll..'\n\nI waited right to the last bit of yellow on the bar before passing, all the time with the mages spamming 'NINJA!' and the priest saying 'If the lock rolls, I do to.'\n\nOur group leader just laughed, the mages? I just got spammed for an hour what a dirty trick that was to pull until i used \/ignore.\n\nLesson here? Mages and priests who want Dreadmist are just plain greedy, they should either wait for it to drop when theres no lock or a lock who has it, or make themselves a lock. Never once have i seen a mage or priest say 'I'm planning on rolling on Dreadmist, feel free to roll on Devout\/Magister's if it drops' Oh no, they just say 'If my class drops I want it, if yours drops I want that to.'","date":"2005-07-11T20:23:57-05:00","rating":43,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"A fantastic trick, and one that hopefully taught the mages in the group something about doing unto others...\n\nBut the best part of your post, imo?&nbsp; When you pointed out that you had all AGREED on looting rules before heading into the instance.&nbsp; Instead of arguing about who \"deserves\" the set, maybe we'd all be better off simply agreeing in the groups who intends to roll for what.&nbsp; That way, you can avoid going all the way though the instance for that one piece in a group where two priests and two mages are going to roll on the one item you want.&nbsp; And, if a priest or mage wa","creationdate":"2006-02-15T20:23:57-06:00","id":1160330,"rating":6,"commentid":2655867,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"icarus1213","importedSubject":"Agreement?

Howl is a 3 second cast which can become a 7 or 8 second cast with multiple enemies striking. Also, a warlock's health is his mana too(life tap).\nThese are [u]some[\/u] of the reasons warlocks need more stamina than other casters,and thus need the dreadmist set.

Ice barrier is really nice, I like to see other people use it, but I'd rather have POM, much more useful\nD. While ice barrier is useful for instances and soloing vs a warlock\/priest, its not going to help you gain the advantage, in most cases in pvp, those 10 seconds help your opponent more than you due to the fact that mages dont have too long of a cd on their spells other than bw or coc\nE. Blast wave has a 45 second cd, and only lasts 6 seconds, people will be able to track you down with it\nF. I don't know many dot's that deal heavy fire\/ice damage other than immolate from a lock\n\nHmmm, I was more talking about 1 vs 1 pvp combat, in which a lock is god. Versus fire mages they have no chance w\/o ice barrier\/block, 3 of their dots will kill a mage with magisters on even if the lock does not attack... But imagine, a mage wearing the dreadmist set, with stamina enchants. He can now contend with a lock and priest due to very high hp\n\nJust examine what u said about a priest. You said \"Shields him\/herself and heals, then fears\" I dont know if you have ever dueled a good priest, but when they do all this your dead, no chance to survive other than somehow getting crit upon crit upon crit.\n\nI still don't get it, these sets do not say what class is allowed to get them, so why would a lock be pissed? Although wearing all of the items in the sets gives a nice bonus for locks, it does not say that mages cannot roll on it\n\nSomething that you were completely off about was that I was going to be doing soley pvp with this one, while I will try it out, I will not. It is instance gear, and I'm pretty sure that many people have told you to aoe an ungodly amount of units and you have, but died with magisters on.

DONT ROLL ON TIER ARMOR SETS.\nAllakhazam may be a nice site, but not everything is correct.  This is why they update every couple days.  Thus the reason why some tier one\/two\/three sets do not show up in class specific.\n\nDUNGEON SETS ARE NOT CLASS SPECIFIC!\nBut priests=devout, dont be idiots and roll agaisnt a warlock=dreadmist who needs the set.  SAME for mages=magister.  You wont get the upgrade that the actual class would get (dungeon set two).  And, priests, you give THEM the right to roll agianst you, so dont complain about warlocks\/mages rolling against you for your own armor sets when you are doing the same thing to them. SHADOW PRIESTS STILL dont not have priority over warlocks.  This should be the proper order: Warlock>shadow priest>any other class \n\nI AM A PRIEST and HATE to hurt others by rolling agianst other classes, so dont attempt to twist this.  Some of you are sitting on your lazy bums and believe every single thing that Allakhazam says.  Not a good move.\n\nBlizzard created those sets for those classes (SET BONUSES CONFIRM IT), they are intended for that class BUT they are not class specific.  My point: Warlocks get the priority on Dreadmist, Mages get the priority on Magister, Priests get the priority on Devout.  BUT if there is the rare case that no warlock\/mage, warlock\/priest, mage\/priest are not in the group, then by all means roll. But you are idiots if you roll on something that gives set bonuses you dont need, especially if there IS a player that needs it(this excludes shadow priests, but still warlock priority)\n\nCHECK THE LINK!

If the case was that only warlocks can use it, then Blizzard would have most definately placed a nice little \"Classes: Warlock\" on the bottom. I'm a 60 lock, and I've run Scholo a total of 36 times now, and NO. It has never dropped. I don't actually need the helm, but it looks cool, you know? I'm still trying.\n\nAnd I think the only part in Scholo you'd actually NEED a lock for is Jandice, in the event that you wipe and you need someone to be soulstoned so that they can res everyone else before all those zombies respawn. (If there's no Shammy to self res) You know what I mean? But, he's right, you really only need a lock for a soulstone, healthstone, and the lovely summoning spell. No, you don't NEED locks in Scholo. Bloodpact\/Seduce\/Spelllock are kind of just pluses. \n\nHowever. So long that you're going to play it THAT way...\n\nNo one needs priests either. I've done TONS of runs through high end instances - and Scholo for that matter - and resto classes are just as good as priests. And shadow priests aren't needed, either, because we out DPS the &*!@ out of you. =] What about the priest buff? What about...Bloodpact? :x Oh gasp.\n\nWhat's better about the resto classes is that they don't steal your cloth, yanno?

However it is now a backup for me as during my time running instances to gather my dreadmist set I picked up the Crimson Felt Hat from Barthilas in UD strat (he's the guy who also drops the key to the city). I like the stats on the dreadmist, but I like the +to pimping with the felt hat. <br /><br />Crimson felt hat --&gt; <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18727">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18727</a><br /><br />Who knew &quot;felt&quot; could have an armor of 68?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this mask looks alot better now<br /><br />before it looked like a tiny bandana thing over your mouth (and my jaw hung through the side so it looked even worse)<br /><br />now it looks really cool,my eyes glow red and the hood makes my face dark so so its hard to see it,<br />i really dont mind the neck coller thing it has, looks good to me.<br />i love how it looks now</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's sad to see how many people get upset over someone rolling on something in a VIDEO GAME. Every time I hear the word &quot;noob&quot;, I think of an acne-ridden 15 year old boy with a cracking voice and arms like spaghetti. Keep ninja looting people, make the little brats scream. :)<br /><br />(For extra fun, disenchant it right in front of them! Trust me, doing this with the dreadmist mask makes them cry!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We get to Gandling the other night, loot is set to master.. wow, Dreadmist drops! Straight away the mages and priests start screaming 'LET US ROLL! ITS A CASTER SET WITH UNREAL STATS, ANYONE WHO CAN USE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ROLL!'<br /><br />But our leader just calmly asked if I had it and when i said no passed the loot to me saying that we all agreed at the start that there would be no cross-class rolling.<br /><br />Anyway, loot is set back to group, we all head off to see the lich, guess what, Magister's drops. The mages are cheering and spamming 'Yes!' and I pipe up and say 'Oooo, look at the stats on that, i want to roll!'<br /><br />Mages reaction? 'NO, NINJA IF YOU ROLL! ITS FOR MAGES'. So I link my current shoulders and say 'But its an upgrade.. and its cloth, any class that can use should be able to roll..'<br /><br />I waited right to the last bit of yellow on the bar before passing, all the time with the mages spamming 'NINJA!' and the priest saying 'If the lock rolls, I do to.'<br /><br />Our group leader just laughed, the mages? I just got spammed for an hour what a dirty trick that was to pull until i used /ignore.<br /><br />Lesson here? Mages and priests who want Dreadmist are just plain greedy, they should either wait for it to drop when theres no lock or a lock who has it, or make themselves a lock. Never once have i seen a mage or priest say 'I'm planning on rolling on Dreadmist, feel free to roll on Devout/Magister's if it drops' Oh no, they just say 'If my class drops I want it, if yours drops I want that to.'</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>FOOL! You are a disgrace to us mages everywhere!<br />If there's ONE class that can escape from every sticky situation thats the MAGE!<br />-Ever heard of &quot;Blink&quot;?<br />-Ever heard of Frost Nova?<br />-Ever heard of Ice Barrier?<br />-Ever heard of Ice Block?<br /><br />In case you re a fire mage:<br />-Ever heard of Blast Wave?<br />-How about the fire/frost wards?<br /><br />I dont need to explain what each spell does, you are a mage, you already know.<br /><br />Warlock: Gets&nbsp; screwed if he gets attacked by multiple enemies, because he only has fear/howl and seduce (that IF sucubus available). Howl is a 3 second cast which can become a 7 or 8 second cast with multiple enemies striking. Also, a warlock's health is his mana too(life tap).<br />These are <u>some</u> of the reasons warlocks need more stamina than other casters,and thus need the dreadmist set. And trust me with 6 enemies on you, a healthstone wont be able to keep you alive to kill all of them, it may not even give you all health needed to flee, plus the +54 stamina IMP will get killed in 2 seconds,so there goes the extra STA.<br /><br />Priest: Shields him/herself and heals. Then what?<br />Shield has a cooldown (weakened soul or something like that) before you can cast it again on your self.<br />Ae fear might be the only way for the priest to flee.(To be honest i never played a priest so i dont really know if they have other spells that would save them, but i'm damn sure about the weakened soul cooldown).<br /><br />Besides,in PVP, no matter what class you are, if there are 5 or 6 players on you (PLAYERS not dumb NPC'S), you re pretty much done (maybe you can <u>instant</u> fear them if you have warrior or priest but that only buys a few seconds,if theres noone around to help you then you re done again).<br /><br />YES, the magister's IS low on stamina, but you can always put +HP/health enchants on it, and try to make the best of it, no?<br />Its not the mages' fault that the magister lacks stamina, but its not the warlocks' fault either is it?<br />OR, if you are a PVP addicted player, try and get the PVP SET MAYBE?<br /><br />I don't know how you play your mage, but i wanna assure you that i PAWN out there with the Magister(and yes i enchanted my gear with HP/STA)!<br /><br />Let the warlocks get their set! If you want the DM set then create a warlock and at the same time, you 'll realise why they need stamina MORE than mages.<br /><br />If again you 're THAT dedicated to get the DM with the mage, then go ahead but NOT at the cost of other warlocks! <br />Sigh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can tell that you did not read what I wrote. I was not saying that I am having problems escaping from units as a mage, I'm saying that magisters is vastly inferior to that of dreadmist. Also, you do not take into consideration that<br />A. Blink can only help you teleport a short distance, useful, but not crucial<br />B. Frost nova is the easiest countered spell in the game, just about all classes can get out of it<br />C. Ice barrier is really nice, I like to see other people use it, but I'd rather have POM, much more useful<br />D. While ice barrier is useful for instances and soloing vs a warlock/priest, its not going to help you gain the advantage, in most cases in pvp, those 10 seconds help your opponent more than you due to the fact that mages dont have too long of a cd on their spells other than bw or coc<br />E. Blast wave has a 45 second cd, and only lasts 6 seconds, people will be able to track you down with it<br />F. I don't know many dot's that deal heavy fire/ice damage other than immolate from a lock<br /><br />Hmmm, I was more talking about 1 vs 1 pvp combat, in which a lock is god. Versus fire mages they have no chance w/o ice barrier/block, 3 of their dots will kill a mage with magisters on even if the lock does not attack... But imagine, a mage wearing the dreadmist set, with stamina enchants. He can now contend with a lock and priest due to very high hp<br /><br />Just examine what u said about a priest. You said &quot;Shields him/herself and heals, then fears&quot; I dont know if you have ever dueled a good priest, but when they do all this your dead, no chance to survive other than somehow getting crit upon crit upon crit.<br /><br />I still don't get it, these sets do not say what class is allowed to get them, so why would a lock be pissed? Although wearing all of the items in the sets gives a nice bonus for locks, it does not say that mages cannot roll on it<br /><br />Something that you were completely off about was that I was going to be doing soley pvp with this one, while I will try it out, I will not. It is instance gear, and I'm pretty sure that many people have told you to aoe an ungodly amount of units and you have, but died with magisters on. With dreadmist on, I will have higher health/spirit, and will be able to do most of this no sweat. The only thing that I agree with you about is that DM set owns ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>why dont you go in to a place like scholo and be the master looter and if a priest rolls for this smack them and if you dont have take it that is what i would do</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well if u need it i understand to roll but if its a set then u should not roll. the set was made for warlocks and should not be rolled on by a mage just because it has better &quot;intel&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I know a lot of people are saying that class comes first but what about talents. There are lots of priests out there who are shadow specced and can use Set Bonuses the Item(s) has to offer.<br />Loot Priority should be (in my opinion) like this.<br /><br />1) Class/Talent<br />2) Mages/priest(if they need and warlock already has or does not want)<br />3) Greed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can understand that mages and priests also want the Dreadmist set.Its all alright for me cause i know that it does have leet stamina.But locks shud have priority first.If locks dont need them priests and mages can roll for them or if there are no locks at all then by all means have it.Just dont ninja it.I doubt many locks roll for magisters/devout.could be wrong.But a tip.Shadow Priests dont need to wear Dreadmist&nbsp; , they can wear felcloth set.Adds to allota Shadow damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok heres how i feel on the subject<br /><br />if a shadow priests wants this set for pvp, he is a n00b...i mean for one you need 6 pieces to even get the +dmg for shadow spells..<br /><br />and two, +21dmg is NOTHING...if you want to waste 6 slots just to get +21dmg then you have no clue what good dmg gear is...right now i am at about +300dmg and i am a warlock who has full dreadmist, and a full pvp set..<br /><br />when i pvp, i have never once used dreadmist...never.<br />so all the shadow priests that say this is good for them for pvp then they are just n00bs. <br /><br />if they really wanted +dmg gear then they wouldnt waste 6slots just to get +21dmg...with 6 slots you can get around +150-200 if you find the right gear..<br /><br />so to all you shadow priests quit whinning and stick to devout or get some REAL dmg gear...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a lock set, as said 100x times before.<br />if there is a 10 man raid party in scolo, and the dreadmist hat drops, and there is 1 lock, and 1 priest (shadow speced).<br /><br />if the lock dosnt got the hat yet, than there is no way the priest may roll.<br />if the lock already got the hat, than the second person who got all the right on the hat is the shadow priest. even if there is a mage in the group! set items you gather to get the complete set.. and there for you most look at the set bonuses to add the classes to it.<br />( dreadmist is all shadow, so locks first!, priest&nbsp; (shadow) second! mages? wth do the want with shadow? )<br /><br />i got a lev 60 shadow priest, and i whas holy till lev 55. and there is no way i am respecing back to holy.. it just sucks. and there for i am after dreadmist.<br />the only way i am able to collect dreadmist, is to create my own party, and there for i can, if i invite a warlock. tell him that i will roll on dreadmist if it drops, and if he wont accept that than the party i made is not the party for him.<br /><br />but i will never roll on a dreadmist item if i am in a other persons group and there is a lock in there who can use it. unles other arengements are made ofcorse..<br /><br />now some people may say.. &quot; if you want dps, roll a lock or mage!&quot;<br />well people, i did!&nbsp; HAH!<br />got a lev 60 lock and a lev 51 mage... and i like the shadow priest most of all. for those who say a shadow priest cant outdamge a warlock should realy do some extra research. the shadow priest is whit out any doubt way stronger than the warlock when it comes down to pvp fights, the mostly last no longer than 10 to 15 seconds and the warlock can NOT outdamge a shadowpriest in such short time. bascily becose the lock got to much dots. and needs time to deal all his damage.<br /><br />to pack it all together again.. dread mist is :<br />1: Warlocks<br />2: Shadow priests<br />3.. all the other classes.. and a mage rolling on dreadmist is just a retard</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Simple Rule people:<br /><br />Warlock &gt; any other class&nbsp; &nbsp; for dreadmist<br /><br />now if the warlock doesn't need&nbsp; then ur welcomed to it.<br /><br />I've ran scholo 31 times dreadmist droped 2 tiems and they have been both ninja'ed from me.&nbsp; Do you know the pain and suffering i went becuase of you free spirited casters.&nbsp; W/e&nbsp; look just be nice and let the lock HAVE RIGHT OF WAY<br /><br />If you want dreadmist that bad&nbsp; make ur own groups and dont invite a warlock.<br /><br />you know im right.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>IMHO the set is for locks ..<br />if u're a shadow priest it means ur a pvp priest and should stick to pvp sets..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Step 1)Hit c and check your class. If Class is Warlock, you may roll. If not, proceed to step 2.<br /><br />Step 2) Check you're group. If there is a Warlock in the group that does not have this peice, do not roll. If no Warlock is present or Warlock has mask, proceed.<br /><br />Also, the Dreadmist items have this order of need<br /><br />Warlocks&gt;Priests&gt;Mages&gt;Anything else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>okay so we get to gandling and the priest and mage and hunter die as myself being a warlock and the tank still alivie i prayed for the DM MASK it dropped the tank was the leader set it to master loot took the witchblade and the mask and hearth out instanly i was pissed ...ninja never get that chance again ...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If I would need on the head piece of Dreadmist I would tell the warlock that he would be able to need on the Magister's if that dropped, but then I wouldn't need on the head piece of Magister's and that's only bad for me. So I think we all should hold us to our own (class) sets, atleast he/she has the piece and you're allowed by everyone from the group.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Warlocks have a quest to upgrade the Dreadmist pieces to Deathmist.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dreadmist is a dungeon set, not a tier set(you warlocks are posting in the tier one armor set forums). DEVOUT is the priest dungeon set. Get your facts straight instead of sitting on your lazy bums and complaining.<br /><br />ALL TIER ONE/TWO/THREE ARMOR SETS are indeed CLASS SPECIFIC. <br />Any guild will screw you up for that. DONT ROLL ON TIER ARMOR SETS.<br />Allakhazam may be a nice site, but not everything is correct. This is why they update every couple days. Thus the reason why some tier one/two/three sets do not show up in class specific.<br /><br />DUNGEON SETS ARE NOT CLASS SPECIFIC!<br />But priests=devout, dont be idiots and roll agaisnt a warlock=dreadmist who needs the set. SAME for mages=magister. You wont get the upgrade that the actual class would get (dungeon set two). And, priests, you give THEM the right to roll agianst you, so dont complain about warlocks/mages rolling against you for your own armor sets when you are doing the same thing to them. SHADOW PRIESTS STILL dont not have priority over warlocks. This should be the proper order: Warlock&gt;shadow priest&gt;any other class <br /><br />I AM A PRIEST and HATE to hurt others by rolling agianst other classes, so dont attempt to twist this. Some of you are sitting on your lazy bums and believe every single thing that Allakhazam says. Not a good move.<br /><br />Blizzard created those sets for those classes (SET BONUSES CONFIRM IT), they are intended for that class BUT they are not class specific. My point: Warlocks get the priority on Dreadmist, Mages get the priority on Magister, Priests get the priority on Devout. BUT if there is the rare case that no warlock/mage, warlock/priest, mage/priest are not in the group, then by all means roll. But you are idiots if you roll on something that gives set bonuses you dont need, especially if there IS a player that needs it(this excludes shadow priests, but still warlock priority)<br /><br />CHECK THE LINK! It will tell you the true facts and which class/set they are MEANT for AND this link is from Blizzard. It's correct.<br /><a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The old version with just a mask would probably be the best head peice out of all the sets but they kinda ruined it when they made this ugly thing.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate is the lowest one out of the entire set? And its at the end of an instance? Might be the last piece i get... &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this was last peice i got out of my dreadmist set. i got every other peice in 1-3 runs, including robe on second ubrs run, probabaly pure luck, but this mask is RAREST drop off him, right next to valor of elements. lightforge was his most common, followed by beaststalker / mag / shadowcraft. <br /><br />after doing lost count number of runs, ive seen at least...<br />lightforge 5-6+times(most common)<br />valor twice(rare)<br />devout twice(uncommon)<br />beaststalker 3 times(common)<br />magisters 3 times(common)<br />shadowcraft 3 times(uncommon)<br />dreadmist once finnaly(last run)<br />this just coming from personal experience, not % from site. i actualy wouldnt trust the drop % on this site either, as it says dreadmist is one of the higher drop rates he can drop, but it actualy ends up being far more rare then others.<br /><br /> seen everything else repeatily, had to do more scholo runs just for mask then all rest of set put together. was wearing magisters crown but downgraded for set bonus's to complete set.(Magisters crown has better added up sta/int including higher intell then dreadmist mask) but i am glad to finnaly be done with my dreadmist set, and can move on with my life and not have to live in scholomance anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well... i think it should be class bound.. Or at least have some lock-only spec..

Locks are useless except for the summon spell. Everyone knows that SP's can out dps locks (or even mages, for that matter) Shadow priests have a right to Dreadmist.....PERIOD. And if Helm of Valor drops, sp's also have a right to it as well, and I don't wanna hear any cries about &quot;waaa waaa Helmet of Valor is a Warrior set waaa waaa.&quot; We need the helmet just as much as a warriors do. Cuz everyone knows; we shadow priests are great at DPS but even better at tanking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>&quot;Ok, maybe you will think I am a n00b or whatever, but frankly, I don't care.<br /><br />I do not see what makes the Dreadmist set such a Warlock only set. It gives Stamina, Intellect and Spirit, something that both Mages and Priests use as well, not just Warlocks.<br /><br />From what I have seen, there is no Lock specific abilities, so why the hell do so many people go spastic when anyone but a Lock rolls for it?&quot;<br /><br />It's the lock set.<br />Plain and simple its the lock set, blizzard says it's the lock set because once locks have certain peices they can turn it in for their teir .5 sets, called deathmist.<br /><br />Still doubt me?<br /><br /><a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/" rel="nofollow">http://worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/</a><br /><br />check dungeon sets 1 and 2, under WARLOCK</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this mask off of the Darkmaster last night, was very happy becuase it was only my third time in scholo and my first time doing that boss. Was kinda pissed Jandice didnt drop the mantle.<br />Okay just to clarify lock get prioity on dreadmist, priests with thier devout and mages get magister.<br />But say if the lock or any other class already has the item then whoever can roll.<br />Hell if the shoulders drop and I already have em I dont care if the rogue takes em. Dont take my gear and I wont take yours :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Blizz needs to make this and any other tier .5 class bound. I understand that all casters want +int +sta and +spr but you have your own armor set. And yes I see that there are no lock only stats on it rigth now but after you do the WARLOCK quest for it you get the +damage and the crit chance something that a mage or priest no matter how into shadow you are cant get, why BECAUSE IS THE WARLOCK QUEST TO GET DEATHMIST. Don't believe me look up <b>Quest: Saving the Best for Last (Warlock only)</b>. Unless a shadow priest wearing dm gets his pet turtle from the orphan quest and somehow tricks the quest giver into thinkin he's a lock and the turlte is his imp you will never get the benefits locks get from dm. So stop takin dm armor from locks that need it even if you ask. Now if there is no lock or he or she doesn't need it yeah is fair game for all to roll on it. With that said...<br /><br />I ran into what many locks do, a jerk shadow priest who took my mask. I'll spare you the details but he didn't ask neither at the beggining or when it dropped he just needed and won the roll. We had agreeded to run UD Strat after for his boots. We did ran it. The boots did drop. But guess who didnt get his drop. We all needed on the boots and funny enough I got them. KARMA BABY KARMA! I dont need to tell you how pissed he was and of course he started calling me a ninja in the LFG channel. Once me and my guild mates that were in the group with him responded to him saying what happened evryone in IF started to make fun of him.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Sep 27th 2006 at 10:15am PDT by Raincall</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Omg Shadow priests go for the pvp set?, If you are a shadow priest you belong in pvp not pve. What is so great about the stats on this set compared to other items well the only thing thats great about this is the possibility to upgrade wich priests can't people are just stupid. This set has nice stats?, lol no it doesn't deathmist have nice stats,. still not, but it's more preffering to have the deathmist than the regulat mix of blue item / green / purple items. Shadowpriests belong in pvp otherwise go holy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay. Shadow priests...They do have some very nice DPS and can own some classes in PvP. (Though not warlocks, of course. &lt;3) If you want your little dreadmist mask so you can mess around in PvP and you told the lock beforehand that you were going to roll, and he decided not to get his ass in gear and leave, than thats his fault. If the case was that only warlocks can use it, then Blizzard would have most definately placed a nice little &quot;Classes: Warlock&quot; on the bottom. I'm a 60 lock, and I've run Scholo a total of 36 times now, and NO. It has never dropped. I don't actually need the helm, but it looks cool, you know? I'm still trying.<br /><br />And I think the only part in Scholo you'd actually NEED a lock for is Jandice, in the event that you wipe and you need someone to be soulstoned so that they can res everyone else before all those zombies respawn. (If there's no Shammy to self res) You know what I mean? But, he's right, you really only need a lock for a soulstone, healthstone, and the lovely summoning spell. No, you don't NEED locks in Scholo. Bloodpact/Seduce/Spelllock are kind of just pluses. <br /><br />However. So long that you're going to play it THAT way...<br /><br />No one needs priests either. I've done TONS of runs through high end instances - and Scholo for that matter - and resto classes are just as good as priests. And shadow priests aren't needed, either, because we out DPS the &amp;*!@ out of you. =] What about the priest buff? What about...Bloodpact? :x Oh gasp.<br /><br />What's better about the resto classes is that they don't steal your cloth, yanno? Heh.</div>
