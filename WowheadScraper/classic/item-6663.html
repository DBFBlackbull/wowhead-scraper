Since I'm 49th level, farming the Witchwigs is quite easy... they drop like flies. Since the witchwigs are so heavily concentrated in a small area you can kills hundreds an hour getting the drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, this recipe will drop for anyone killing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thottbot says about 1% drop rate off of lvl 13 Zehvras.<br /><br />Got it after 109, not too shabby.&nbsp; Only took about an hour including time getting ganked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i killed at least 1000 whichwings and the bloody thing never dropped, so if any one on the azjol-nerub (europe)server finds it im willing to pay 100g for the recipe.<br /><br />you can /w me ingame at blitzthose<br />or msn me at blitz-those@fragworld.co.uk</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have had the SDD recipe drop 4 times in like 3 hours and this recipe drop like 2 times...I shouldnt tell anyone this but the best place to find these recipes is off of the cutthroats and pirate guys south of Ratchet. Also the Venture Co North of sludge fen drop this alot...or maybe the percentage thingy went nuts for me...lag has its benefits i guess...=P HOPE THIS HELPED SOMEONE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My lv 14 hunter got it of something in the oasis in the barrens it looks so cool with a tauren</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>some people got this on ah for 10s on new servers :P<br /><br />this is worth on old servers(servers with almost only lvl 60s)like 25-100g<br /><br />got 2 sold one for 45g and lurning the other one for sealing the potons which are worth 2g each or more<br /><br />PS u cant farm thease to low drop rate just buy expensive on ah or just be a lucky guy/girl and just find it in almost any mob.<br /><br />got mine in stv</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me 3 hours of farming to get this. I got it off one of the BB guys on Dreadmist. Very next kill I got the SDD recipie so it must have been a sign.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>off the witchwings, was farming for this and the SDD recipe and learned this one from the first one gonna sell the second one, pst me if you want deathwing server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>man i go to the AH for this recipe and i find squat so i have to go to the barrens and i find it after 3 days of killing stuff that was lower lvl than me! is it worth it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found this while farming all day for the recip� for Savory Deviate Delights! I now make the elixir and cook the fish and reap a massive profit from it. Happy Hunting. (I found it from the pig men villages in the barrens)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where can i farm for this?<br /><br />Ive read some comments and it seems basically razor things and the harpies in the barrens is this true?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have bought and sold this soooo many times! This is one of the biggest money makers for me, very continuos cashflow.<br />I have never gotten it dropped, but when i see it in an AH (usually in the Neutral zones due to horde getting the drop more frequently) <br />When i sell the Recipe, it sells for 35g-55g with out any hitch.&nbsp; Recipe collectors, for fun, it is rare.<br />And the potions, I sell stacks of 5 for 4.50g each. thats just a gauranteed seller at that price, but I have and still do offer demos and samples and sell it for more.<br />Very fun, very cheap, and brings home the bacon.<br /><br />~ZombieFace<br />65 Warlock, PvP, Altar of Storms</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed the burning blade guys in the barrens with my 44 rogue until i got this. I even got the swiftness potion recipe and both is OWNAGE =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got the recipe from a plainstrider how much does it go for ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed Barrens mobs for about 5 hours/day for about a week. Looted this off of an Oasis Snapjaw turtle near the Lushwater Oasis.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Selling these at first was uber slow, as I seem to be the only person who currently has this recipe (my server is relatively new)<br />The major problem people had with it is that it only lasts 2 minutes, but selling it in stacks of 5 seems to make it more desirable; not the greatest potion to sell, i'd recommend Swiftness, it's a lot more practical</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there is NO WAY that this sold for 94 g, do you mean 94 silver?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hehe, second time that I have it, first time I sold it for 3g, they wont buy for more expensive I think.<br />Sometimes they do, but aw well, its nice that I have this for my second time.</div>
