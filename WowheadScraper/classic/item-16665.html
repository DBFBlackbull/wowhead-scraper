find it hilarious about the posts ive read in here that say hunters are low dps or unnecessary.&nbsp; Lets face it a hunter who hasnt screwed up his talents unleashes more damage than anyone else.&nbsp; If i use an aimed shot followed by the first attack by autoshot plus a multishot right after which is my usual plan of attack, then ive dealth a minimum of 550dmg for aimed + around 300 dmg for autoshot attack + at least 600 for multishot= which brings us to around lets say 1300 damage in about 2 seconds of combat, 5 seconds if you throw in the casting time for aimed shot.&nbsp; But wait theres more.&nbsp; Lets say that my aimed shot attack criticals >:) now my aimed shot has gone from a minimum of 550 dmg to a minimum of somewhere around 1200 damage.&nbsp; So now we have 1200+300+600=2100 damage at the start of the fight.&nbsp; now with all the damage the hunter has probably taken aggro unless your tank is really focusing, so at that point you would keep firing autoshots and any stings you may want depending on the situation until the monster gets too close for you to fire, at which point you feign death get up and you should be ready to repeat the process for another 1300-2100 damage range.&nbsp; But wait theres more LOL.&nbsp; The hunter should also have his trueshot aura active granting an attack power bonus for the group, furthermore a smart hunter would have put his mark on the target before the fight which would increase the attack power of everyone in the party attacking him.&nbsp; Then you factor in that the hunter has mail armor which can be combined with distract shot and concussive shot to help save the healer in the group in the event that they have taken aggro.&nbsp; All this and the hunter still has the ability to keep his forms of tracking active so he can warn the group of any incoming patrols or other enemies.&nbsp; That should be enough for any class, but not for the hunters, they even come with the Volley attack so they can contribute their very own AOE to the battle when the situation calls for it.&nbsp; \n\nSo there you have it folks, proof that if you dont have a hunter in your party then your not doing real DPS.&nbsp; Oh BTW these numbers were factored in by my hunter whose currently lvl 57, since most of these posts are about MC youd have to think about how much more damage that hunter is doing with and upgraded aimed shot and trueshot aura, i believe i have another multishot coming too, then factor in the extra attackpower bonus from the beaststalkers and youve got some serious firepower.&nbsp; and

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whats the cooldown on the shot? ie if we just have one hunter with this and he misses= wipe? :S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To anrchyboy, If you hunters arent dealing much dps in MC you seriously need to replace them. I am always in the top percentage in any raid group, granted good mages make me look like a non player but I am always up there. Absorb arrows more than melee? What the hell MC are you running?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1. The top 10 damage dealers in MC are rogues, hunters and the occasional mage because the mages are usually decursing.&nbsp; Mages come on and off the chart while Rogues and hunters never stop doing their DPS.<br />2. Yes this shot is only good for ONE purpose, but like people said .. if you have seen magamadar frenzied ..... you have seen main tanks die in 2 shots.&nbsp; The importance of this shot is not to be understated by the fact that it is only usuable on one mob.&nbsp; <br />3. Magamadar is doable with 2 tranqs if you're <i>lucky</i>.&nbsp; Tranq shots have missed in succession, and a frenzied mag is no good.<br />We have alot of tranq shots now .. and no problems. : D <br />4. It is a guaranteed drop off of Lucifron, and it is to kill the next boss magmadar.<br /><br />Anyone calling this shot LAME because it has a limited use, clearly has not been to MC.&nbsp; A hunter with a tranq shot is more important than a healer for mag.&nbsp; One of our hunters with the tranq has a 60 priest.&nbsp; We make him bring is 60 hunter to MC instead of the priest. : P<br /><br />BTW, I am alliance and we killed him with no dwarf priests.&nbsp; They are not needed, they are only a luxury.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey Laserus or whatever your name is, I play a hunter and 9 times out of 10 I out dps everything but rogues.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually, who the F&amp;$� cares who does the most damage, in particular if the raid makes it through Ragnaros? Seeing the examples above, it is very obvious that there a dozens of different ways to deal &quot;the most damage&quot;, and a couple of different classes can do it. Being a hunter, I rather do less damage, but constant damage, without ever needing healing and therefore doing indirectly triple my own damage keeping other people alive (saving healer's mana) who also keep doing their damage.<br /><br />You are such a bunch of I-got-the-longest's.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is why I hate Thotbot. Too many whiners. <br /><br />Yes, hunters do a lot of DPS. Yes, mages do a lot of dps.. same with rogues and certain warrior classes.<br /><br />What you all fail to remember is that each class has a ROLE in a group (be it 2 man or 40 man). Hunters are meant to do mid-high dps consistently and don't eat prescious healing mana.. at least not normally. BUT - we CAN take hits. No, maybe not from a boss that hits for 2-3k per swing, but if your rogues and warriors are down and the mobs are going after your healers, wouldn't you rather sacrifice a pet or two in order to get a few of your warriors rezzed and continue the battle? Or would you not take any hunters with you at all b/c we roll on items that we might not HAVE to have? <br />We can also split off mobs... some of us can even tank! The ROLE of a hunter is to be multi-purpose. <br /><br />It disgusts me when I join a raid group and the 'leadership' is trying to figure out how to break off mobs. &quot;Ok, mage, sheep that one. But what should we do with the other 3?&quot; ... So I say &quot;Hunters can trap, it's only 30 seconds, but it should give us long enough to get one down.&quot; and I CONSISTENTLY get ignored. <br /><br />Hunter + Goblin Jumper Cables = Pwnage! (raid wipe, hunter Feigns, uses cables to rez the priests and pallies who rez entire raid -- please quit whimpering about hunters who feign instead of dying with the group)<br /><br />Hunter + Potions 4tw! (Hunters can stay alive longer than almost any other class if they use their pet, potions and bandages to their benefit. Feign in dire emergencies)<br /><br />And for God's sake, please quit correcting everybody's spelling errors/typos! All it really does is ADD SPAM and we all know there's already enough BS in these forums without all of the kindergarden antics.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To reassure those who asked questions:<br />The Shot is learned by using the book, which consumes the book. Once learned, you can use the shot once every 20 Seconds (if you've got the mana), and it breaks rage effects (several mobs outside MC get them at 30-20% hp, Magdamar gets it randomly). The Shot can miss, and it can be resisted.<br /><br />About which class does the most dps:<br />Well, I was surprised once at a Pally in Strat who was very close to the rogue in a 10 man raid. Hunters, Warlocks, another rogue, he beat them all, damage-wise. The rogue was 3rd, behind me (Fury Warrior back then - not tanking) and a mage - we had done twice as much damage as the Pally, each.<br /><br />In the end it is more important how you play your class, and what equipment you use, than what class you actually are.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hunters, get the tome, right click on it to LEARN it..<br /><br />Get your Tranquilizing Shot as a NEW SKILL.<br /><br />that's it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>juss to let the hunters out there know. you will need tranq shot if u plan to do the epic quest for Rhok'delar, longbow of the ancient keepers. happy hunting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>20 sec. cooldown...good to have at least 3 hunters with it.&nbsp; Doable with only 1 hunter with it, but he had better have some +to hit gear.&nbsp; <br /><br />In Soviet Russia Mag is a little #$%^&amp; all the time, however in MC if he is enraged he will wipe your raid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Damn are we talking about this abilities or about the DPS of the classes ?<br /><br />You're all annoying ...<br /><br />And by the way who tested it outside MC, on mobs, players, etc...And&nbsp; tell the effects this ability produce (since no logs show the effects) , instead of arguying about your egos (<b>and we don't care about it by the way ...</b>) <br /><br />Morrons like you annoy me ...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>but hunters consistantly come out in the top 10 for damage in molten core. along with rogues, mages, and warlocks. its a fact. if i could post damage meters from all my guild's MC runs it would prove it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is no use in arguing this..specifically imo because different situations call for different strategies.&nbsp; For instance, High Priestess Mar'li in ZG (spider boss) my guilds technique is we ranged dps her down to like 20% and then melee goes in...<br /><br />obviously &amp;*!@ like that will result in hunters having more dps--other situations call for hunters to hold off on dps while rogues and stuff wail on adds or something... <br /><br />you just can't say one class is higher dps than the other--it's all based on how people play, how they're specced and what gear... and when you consider crit chance, how lucky you are.&nbsp; I've had a damage meter show me having 70% crit chance after a ZG run... its supposedly only 20%, so please end this discussion and all discussions related.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We use this on Thekal all the time. It dispells his frznzy which grants +150% attack speed. I'm not sure what other bosses out hunters have tried it on, but I think it works on more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>how you play. As an individual. No one class pwns any other one class. I'm a lvl 60 rogue, in good blues with Fang of the Crystal Spider m/h, Bonescraper off hand.<br /><br />Example 1. UBRS run. Me, in my gear, did more dps than a hunter in epics with Rhok'daelar, by a significant margin.<br /><br />Example 2. MC run. Hunter in mainly blues, a couple of purples, with Ancient Bone Bow, beat me by a significant margin.<br /><br />DPS depends on FAR too many factors to say any one dps class has the advantage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can this be used ONLY on beasts? or can it be used on humanoids,undead,demons etc?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i find it hilarious about the posts ive read in here that say hunters are low dps or unnecessary.&nbsp; Lets face it a hunter who hasnt screwed up his talents unleashes more damage than anyone else.&nbsp; If i use an aimed shot followed by the first attack by autoshot plus a multishot right after which is my usual plan of attack, then ive dealth a minimum of 550dmg for aimed + around 300 dmg for autoshot attack + at least 600 for multishot= which brings us to around lets say 1300 damage in about 2 seconds of combat, 5 seconds if you throw in the casting time for aimed shot.&nbsp; But wait theres more.&nbsp; Lets say that my aimed shot attack criticals &gt;:) now my aimed shot has gone from a minimum of 550 dmg to a minimum of somewhere around 1200 damage.&nbsp; So now we have 1200+300+600=2100 damage at the start of the fight.&nbsp; now with all the damage the hunter has probably taken aggro unless your tank is really focusing, so at that point you would keep firing autoshots and any stings you may want depending on the situation until the monster gets too close for you to fire, at which point you feign death get up and you should be ready to repeat the process for another 1300-2100 damage range.&nbsp; But wait theres more LOL.&nbsp; The hunter should also have his trueshot aura active granting an attack power bonus for the group, furthermore a smart hunter would have put his mark on the target before the fight which would increase the attack power of everyone in the party attacking him.&nbsp; Then you factor in that the hunter has mail armor which can be combined with distract shot and concussive shot to help save the healer in the group in the event that they have taken aggro.&nbsp; All this and the hunter still has the ability to keep his forms of tracking active so he can warn the group of any incoming patrols or other enemies.&nbsp; That should be enough for any class, but not for the hunters, they even come with the Volley attack so they can contribute their very own AOE to the battle when the situation calls for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />So there you have it folks, proof that if you dont have a hunter in your party then your not doing real DPS.&nbsp; Oh BTW these numbers were factored in by my hunter whose currently lvl 57, since most of these posts are about MC youd have to think about how much more damage that hunter is doing with and upgraded aimed shot and trueshot aura, i believe i have another multishot coming too, then factor in the extra attackpower bonus from the beaststalkers and youve got some serious firepower.&nbsp; and if you dont believe me then go watch a group fight a boss, hunter is the only class i usually see doing so much damage that they actually can take aggro from warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have read almost all the posts on this thread and have come to this conclusion!<br /><br /> all classes have a role in a raid and are needed to defeat any boss. so who cares what dps is done by whom as long as the boss is dead and we reap the rewards!<br /><br /> yes i am a lvl 60 bm hunter and i do alot of dps but my roll in the instances i have done is to deal range damage manage agro control <br />(for healers) and in most cases pull mobs and control adds.<br /><br />but if each class does not do thier job and or does not know how to do thier job the boss and his cronies win.</div>
