Ok guys. Let's clear this whole thing up once and for all!&nbsp; This is my suggestion.&nbsp; Get the fourth first, cause then the third will be HELLA easy to find.\n\nTWO Main Entrances:\n1) East Entrance - From the Jungle\n2) West Entrance - From the Beach\n\nThese are directions from the East Entrance: \n\nThe Fourth Troll Legend: Is on the highest elevated area of the whole ruin.&nbsp; Some people are saying it's a hill (which confused me, cause I looked for an actual hill, but it's actually walled off).&nbsp; What you need to do is take the main road that goes through the ruins and go all the way to the west side (it will decline a bit before a turn), and at the turn you'll see a \"RAMP\" that goes up to the highest elevated area.&nbsp; you'll see it once you make it up the ramp.\n\nThe Third Troll Legend:&nbsp; Ok, after you've gotten the Fourth Troll Legend, go to the south wall(perimeter) of that elevated area and face south.&nbsp; You'll see different ruins(some people used the term \"room\") south of the road that goes through the ruin.&nbsp; The ruin that holds the Third Troll Legend is the ruin that is THE MOST \"WESTERN\" ruin.&nbsp; If you go in to this ruin, you should actually be able to see the coast. (So technically speaking, The Third Legend is somewhat directly south of where you got teh Fourth Legend).&nbsp; You just have to....\"cross the road\".&nbsp; \n\nDirections from the West Entrance:\n\nThis will be much easier! Just fight you're way through and sooner or later you'll see that the path leads to the main road.&nbsp; When you see the main road, you will also see the ramp, as described above, on the left.&nbsp; To get Fourth Legend, take the left ramp and go all the way up.&nbsp; Then Follow the above directions for the Third Troll Legend.\n\nI hope this helps you guys.&nbsp; I hate the fact that many of those who have posted did not make a clear distinction of whether they picked up the fourth or the third.&nbsp; Should take 10-20 minutes just to do the third and fourth legends if you use these directions.","date":"2005-11-24T01:30:53-06:00","rating":16,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Thank you!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is not up a hill, southwest of the ruins..inside the ruins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>was 23,12 for me as well, using COSMOS</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This tablet is not in the large squarish &quot;main&quot; ruins.&nbsp; It is further south, in the smaller set of ruins.&nbsp; The tablet is in the furthest west ruined building, in the northwest corner.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok me and my wife just spent about an hour using Eagle Eye and Eyes of the Beast scouting for this tablet. it's at the furthest <b>South Western Part of the Ruins</b> if you come form the main entrance of Zul Kunda (not the beach) run along the southern border of the ruins straight west, it's the last building before you hit the beach. no there is no viable beach access.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here is what I did...<br /><br />Went to the beach.&nbsp; Snuck up past the little ruins on the beach to the entrance on the west side of the Zulkunda ruins.&nbsp; There is a &quot;room&quot; with a ton of mystics in it and the tablet is in the corner.&nbsp; I stood on the hill right in front of the entrance and killed as many as I could by myself w/o pulling every single one to me.<br /><br />Then, I sent my pet in and while he was distracting the 5 other mystics, I got the tablet.&nbsp; Easy as pie!&nbsp; (OK it took a couple tries...)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The third tablet is by far the hardest. If you come in the main south entrance you need to stay to the left on the path, then go into the walled area on the left before the path goes downhill. Go all the way down with the wall on your right, the tablet is in the NE corner the last walled area. It is heavily guarded: 3 troll lightnings mages camping the tablet and 4 or 5 others in the area. Bring a group or a good plan.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Scroll is in the ruins just up a little hill from the beach. Taking the beach side is less risky as you can handle the MOBs one by one. In the room there are around7 or so MOBs. I pulled one of them and killed him. I sent my voidwalker in alone and targeted him to the MOB closest to the tablet then farther away. I ran to the stone and got the Scroll but was killed on my way out. IT was worth it.<br /><br />The ruin is not on the beach but just up a little hill. The room has no roof and has several entrances to it. It is close to the beach (the West) and to the South. <br /><br />Good hunting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>there was a comment in here that said it is not in teh &quot;main&quot; ruins but rather the NW smaller ruins building just before and that is DEAD ON accurate. There is a small set of ruins down on teh beach...not the ones ya pass on the way out of Grom'gol but further N. Go right up the hill there on the path leading a little&nbsp; south go up on the plateau and its right in the ruins. These are like 8 x 4' tablets and really easy to find...so I am not sure if everyone is looking for the right size object.<br /><br />Another Landmark : There is an island off shore with water elementals on it (other missions). This ruins you seek is only like 100meters further N from that island N up the coast and UP ON THE PLATAEU. Not down on the beach. Good luck finding I hope I helped even one of ya...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Latest Titan Mod puts it at 22,12 as of 07/08/05</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can find the third troll tablet at coordinates 23,12 using the lates version of Cosmos. And indeed, you find it at the south-west corner of the ruins heavily guarded by Mystics...<br /><br />goodluck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It was easy to find even without using /tloc which I don't use.<br />You can seek them when you're wisp or ghost :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>23, 12</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All you previous posters who were talking about the fourth troll legend....<br /><br />YOU GUYS NEED TO WAKE UP! Ok guys. Let's clear this whole thing up once and for all!&nbsp; This is my suggestion.&nbsp; Get the fourth first, cause then the third will be HELLA easy to find.<br /><br />TWO Main Entrances:<br />1) East Entrance - From the Jungle<br />2) West Entrance - From the Beach<br /><br />These are directions from the East Entrance: <br /><br />The Fourth Troll Legend: Is on the highest elevated area of the whole ruin.&nbsp; Some people are saying it's a hill (which confused me, cause I looked for an actual hill, but it's actually walled off).&nbsp; What you need to do is take the main road that goes through the ruins and go all the way to the west side (it will decline a bit before a turn), and at the turn you'll see a &quot;RAMP&quot; that goes up to the highest elevated area.&nbsp; you'll see it once you make it up the ramp.<br /><br />The Third Troll Legend:&nbsp; Ok, after you've gotten the Fourth Troll Legend, go to the south wall(perimeter) of that elevated area and face south.&nbsp; You'll see different ruins(some people used the term &quot;room&quot;) south of the road that goes through the ruin.&nbsp; The ruin that holds the Third Troll Legend is the ruin that is THE MOST &quot;WESTERN&quot; ruin.&nbsp; If you go in to this ruin, you should actually be able to see the coast. (So technically speaking, The Third Legend is somewhat directly south of where you got teh Fourth Legend).&nbsp; You just have to....&quot;cross the road&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Directions from the West Entrance:<br /><br />This will be much easier! Just fight you're way through and sooner or later you'll see that the path leads to the main road.&nbsp; When you see the main road, you will also see the ramp, as described above, on the left.&nbsp; To get Fourth Legend, take the left ramp and go all the way up.&nbsp; Then Follow the above directions for the Third Troll Legend.<br /><br />I hope this helps you guys.&nbsp; I hate the fact that many of those who have posted did not make a clear distinction of whether they picked up the fourth or the third.&nbsp; Should take 10-20 minutes just to do the third and fourth legends if you use these directions.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had difficulities locating this too even with the directions. I finally found it, but have not been able to obtain it due to all the trolls. <br /><br /><a href="http://img455.imageshack.us/img455/46/antrasview3rdtablet6aj.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img455.imageshack.us/img455/46/antrasview3rdtablet6aj.jpg</a> Here is my screen shot to get a better idea where it is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The above instructions will clearly tell you where to find the last two tablets in the largest of the ruins, but they might not help you decide how many friends you need.&nbsp; If you are a 'traditional' player and go in to kill what you find --- you'll need to be a lvl40-41 to solo, a lvl39 with a single friend, and three of you lvl37 or less.&nbsp; If you're smart, deliberate and a tight group, you'll probably aggro no more than two at a time --- even at the tablets themselves (the entrance from the jungle will always aggro two mobs and a pet).&nbsp; If you're 'cowboys', then watch out --- you'll aggro 5-6-7!&nbsp; If you can't get a group and/or want to solo at a relatively low lvl, then you can do these by my favorite method --- 'strategic dying' --- just keep running and dying until you're close by and then rez in the absolute corner of the 'rooms' and inch toward the tablet until you can open it.&nbsp; Of if you're a hunter, like me, then you can use your pet effectively by sending him past the mob to aggro them and then run to the tablets while he dies (sorry, my pet).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Your vantage point for the thrid tablet is outside the Ruins at the South West corner. Yuo can see the beach.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what? this screenshot is .. duh...this screenshot is the one that shows the first legend : MOON OVER THE VALE! ... I didn't fing the third legend anywhere...:(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just did this one twice (I shift-clicked the tablet the first time and somehow didn't pick it up so I had to go back and do it again).<br /><br />The thing is, it depended on the mobs that were guarding the tablets as to whether I could do it alone as a 36 Holy Priest.&nbsp; When there were 2 mystic trolls and a hunter guarding I found it very difficult and rezzed 3 times and could not do it alone.&nbsp; I went back the next morning and there were 2 scouts and a hunter and had no trouble doing it solo.&nbsp; The second time that morning there was a mystic, a hunter, and a scout.&nbsp; Again, no trouble.&nbsp; <br /><br />Biggest problem for me was that the mystics were immune to my fire wand and I ran out of mana too fast.&nbsp; Also, last night, I seemed to aggro all three of the guards, but today I am only aggroing the closest 2 and killing the 3rd one by himself.<br /><br />Just adding my .02 and some variables involved.&nbsp; Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The fourth i had no trouble with, come around the ruin to the beach from the east, stay on the edge of the hill, a couple of kills, you should see it, i then stayed running the hill as well as i could &quot; you will fall&quot; come to the bak entrance, if you go straight to the corner, jump on the rail thats on the wall, theres a boss guy right there. he killed me so fast. I then ran bak in ghost went to the top where they were, found one, rezed on him, got lucky only pulled one, then i JUMPED INTO POOL&lt; AND PICK THEM OFF , the third one is right up against the pool,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The tablet is normally guarded by a group of 5 trolls.&nbsp; If anyone saw them with less then the others had been attacked.<br /><br />This is NOT a solo quest unless you are far higher level than 35-37 or unless you get lucky and find the tablet before the full respawn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the coor r more like 23.12 but to be more specific it in the most southwest room of this ruin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Standing right in front of the tablet, I am at 22, 12. There is a set of ruins called the Zul'Kunda ruins in the top left (NW) corner of the map. It appears as an arch with two pillars surrounding it on the map.<br /><br />This particular tablet is nearest the shoreline. Get close, then use the location to fine-tune.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Using cosmos the location is 22,12</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The stone is called fall of gurubshi and is located on the right most mountain if you enter from the shoreline area. NW area on map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK, so some of us players don't have cords, so here's a detailed decription of how i found it. I found the enterence to the Zul'kuda ruins from the northeast of the hunter expedition site, I followed the hills on the left side of the ruins, you'll go past raptors on the some side, once past the raptors find the highest point to climb, once I was on the top ridge i could see a small ruin to the right of the mountains.

( and yes i know my spelling is bad)<br />If your comming from the beach it's the right building at the top</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can't find this one...I found the fourth one, it's on top the hill in the ruins...but this one eludes me, and everyone says it's farther west, which I went, and that just takes you down the hill, and there's nothing down there but a different set of ruins?</div>
