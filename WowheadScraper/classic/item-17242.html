<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The voices that land on death ears... are so far i heard: &quot;Arthas&quot;: I've taken care of evrything. then Arthas's father (the king) says: What is the meaning of this? and then Arthas says: Suxeeting (or howwever u wright it down) you, father! (or something like it but then he kills his father i know it from the Warcraft 3 movies) And when he killed him he says just like the voices in the hall: This kingdom, is about too fall! And from its ashes, there shall rise a new order! That will shake its very foundacions (or however u wright that last word... But it all starts with this: Arthas's dad says: What is the meaning of this? And then Medivh says: Humanity is in great peril the tides of darkness have come agian!... I know the whole story but its way too much too explain<br />U must play&nbsp; Warcraft for that xD :p and the frozen throne (expansion of it) is also very nice! but so far for the voices... thats all i heard and i hear it over and over so... this has nothing too deal with the key ad all...</div>
