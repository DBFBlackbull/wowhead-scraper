Because of that, I've taken time to record this for other paladins. Here's my account of this sub-quest after reading all the posts to date, and having completed it myself. I hope this will help minimize frustration.\n\nThe gem is in Blackfathom Deep. \n\nTo get there, take the boat from Menethil Harbor in the Wetlands too Auberdine (the rightmost boat). \n\nOnce you arrive, go to the north side of town and talk to Thundris Windweaver to get the Kor Gem subquest. \n\nRun south to Ashenvale. Blackfathom Deep is in the northwestern most corner.\n\nNOTE: Ashenvale is the region south of DarkShore, and the quest area is in the little nook on the map on the NW corner of Ashenvale. It's a LONG corpse run back to this site BTW, so don't die.\n\nBlackfathom Deep (BFD) is cool because it's a building with a pool in the middle right near the shore. Jump down into the pool, dive under the water, then resurface on the other side. To help find the entrance, look for whirling lights then come up out of the water.\n\nIf you're in a party, getting the gem isn't too difficult because it drops outside of the instance located deep inside BFD. There's no need to go into the instance to complete this quest.\n\nIf you're solo, it may take some time. I went in as a lvl 25 Pally and got pwnd several times. \n\nTo get the gem, you've got to kill the nagas (some people say it's easy, but it wasn't for me. I killed about 15 mobs before the gem dropped). \n\nIf you don't know what nagas are, just find and kill oracles and preistesses until the gem drops. \n\nThe gem drops in a \"corrupt\" state so you must take it to Thundris Windreaver back in Auburdine to be purified. This will complete the quest.\n\nHope this helps...have fun!","date":"2005-07-05T17:16:41-05:00","rating":132,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"The \"corrupt\" state confused me too, until I realized I needed to have Thudris purify it back in Auberdine.","creationdate":"2019-11-24T17:25:45-06:00","id":1340924,"rating":1,"commentid":2707637,"dataTree":4,"roles":256,"username":"Spladow","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"17 Years later I am using this information.

He will disarm, so you need to time your judgments, also you might as well heal during disarms because you can't do much damage anyway.\n\n5.  After he is down, you will need to judge to pull the [npc=4802].  She will cast and there is a pat, so the best thing to do is to run back to around a little nub of a wall near the water's edge to line of sight her.  Her spells will slow you, so you can pop [spell=1044] to break it and get around that corner.  Save your [spell=853] for the heals, as she heals about 50% of her life.\n\n6. Slowly and carefully move deeper into the cave using the same techniques.\n\nNOTE:  IF you end up getting more mobs that you can handle, just run to the water at the entrance and dive down, swimming away.  As soon as you do this, they will peel off.  This saved me 3-4 times.\n\n7. Return to Auberdine to turn in the quest to [npc=3649].  Do not forget this step or you will have another long boat ride.\n\nI don't know if I was lucky or if the drop rate is high, but I only had to kill 4 of the Nagas.","date":"2020-02-28T06:50:36-06:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"As mentioned above, make sure you have the quest from Thundris IN ADDITION to your paladin class quest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To spell it out: you need to get the quest Seeking the Kor Gem from Thundris Windreaver before going to blackfathom depths or the naga will never drop the gem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>SUMMARY 6-26-05<br /><br />Finding and acquiring the Kor Gem was the most frustrating part of this Paladin quest for me. Because of that, I've taken time to record this for other paladins. Here's my account of this sub-quest after reading all the posts to date, and having completed it myself. I hope this will help minimize frustration.<br /><br />The gem is in Blackfathom Deep. <br /><br />To get there, take the boat from Menethil Harbor in the Wetlands too Auberdine (the rightmost boat). <br /><br />Once you arrive, go to the north side of town and talk to Thundris Windweaver to get the Kor Gem subquest. <br /><br />Run south to Ashenvale. Blackfathom Deep is in the northwestern most corner.<br /><br />NOTE: Ashenvale is the region south of DarkShore, and the quest area is in the little nook on the map on the NW corner of Ashenvale. It's a LONG corpse run back to this site BTW, so don't die.<br /><br />Blackfathom Deep (BFD) is cool because it's a building with a pool in the middle right near the shore. Jump down into the pool, dive under the water, then resurface on the other side. To help find the entrance, look for whirling lights then come up out of the water.<br /><br />If you're in a party, getting the gem isn't too difficult because it drops outside of the instance located deep inside BFD. There's no need to go into the instance to complete this quest.<br /><br />If you're solo, it may take some time. I went in as a lvl 25 Pally and got pwnd several times. <br /><br />To get the gem, you've got to kill the nagas (some people say it's easy, but it wasn't for me. I killed about 15 mobs before the gem dropped). <br /><br />If you don't know what nagas are, just find and kill oracles and preistesses until the gem drops. <br /><br />The gem drops in a &quot;corrupt&quot; state so you must take it to Thundris Windreaver back in Auburdine to be purified. This will complete the quest.<br /><br />Hope this helps...have fun!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just like to thanks to sparker8 :)<br /><br />your summary was very useful and to the point, i was able to complete this with ease :)<br /><br />and to all your little scroats who moan and groan about what could have been said / not said, the point is this.<br /><br />What he said, got the job done.. which is the main thing<br /><br />Thanks again sparker8 :)<br /><br />regards<br /><br />foobs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got it on the second drop while killing nagas.<br /><br />REMEMBER to talk to Thundris Windweaver BEFORE you go after the gem!<br /><br />He's located in Auberdine, Darkshore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well... I did this quest alone at lvl 23 :) The most challange was in Shadowfang Keep i must say..... Good luck to rest of you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soloed this at 22. Yes. Soloed.<br /><br />Got it off the first one I killed, which was lucky, cos no, it couldn't have been soloed otherwise, any further in and I would have been dealing with mobs rather than just the one naga on its own. Easy for me though, hope others get my luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thank god i got it on my first one.&nbsp; I was really worried.&nbsp; If its a Mana battle, you will win.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I soloed this quest easy at lvl 21.&nbsp; No potions, but had good gear: 1959 def with shield.&nbsp; My health never got to half life.&nbsp; Just take the mobs one at a time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this was by far the easy part of the quest, i soloed it at lvl 25 but im sure i could have done it at 21 or even 20.. you dont even have to go into the instance to get the gem. before the instance there are a few pools of water, with naga priestess and oracles... btw they are the ones who drop the stone anyways... well this hammer is sweet.. total ownage... good luck pallys</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I also did it at level 26 solo...&nbsp; Or somewhat.&nbsp; I could have done it solo.&nbsp; But instead i did all of VC, not just part for quest.&nbsp; Thanks for the help everyone.&nbsp; Something that confused me, Blackfathom Deep or w/e that place is for the gem is southwest corner of darkshire / northwest of ashen</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So my pally is lvl 27 and I am realizing now I should have completed this quest earlier.&nbsp; Not to upset since this is my first time playing Wow, but my question is how long will verigan's fist be a good option for me?&nbsp; I know it depends on a lot, but roughly, what level will it become obsolete?&nbsp; Any specific weaps that replace it?<br /><br />Thanks again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what lvl r the nagas</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the item in the first Naga I killed :D very easy or I'm just lucky like the hell :D<br /><br />Even so I think it's perfectly soloable at lvl 25!<br /><br />Don't get mad about that item imho it's the 2nd easy item!<br /><br />First the ore supplyment that is very easy<br />Then the Gem that is easy the bad thing is the long walk trough Darkshore<br />The Lumber in The Deadmines is the third but a group won't be difficult to find<br />And the last one the dam Hammer that is pain in the ass to get it! Find a guild mate to help you or else it will be very tought to find a group</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was in BFD about 30 min ago and didint get any gem from the naga :S dno if its just my badluck or</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can anyone help me find it becuase if i go in there i die. anyone?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Reading all the comments and tips form all of you made this so easy ty very much i actualy think the hardest part of the quest is SFK... so its a pretty easy quest!<br /><br />Remember Patience is a vertue!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dont know why is that happening to me i was searxhing Kor Gem for 3 hours i killed at least 50 nagas and noone drops it<br /><br />where is it exactly?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The gem can be found in Ashenvale, The North-Western shore. It will say the Zoram Strand. Search around the beach and you will see a ruined temple that leads underground go there and down the stairs. When there is a little pond, swim under it and into the next area. There are lvl 20-21 Elites in there. Kill those&nbsp; (the one's with tails for legs) and it will drop. I soloed this at lvl 24 so It shouldn't be a problem. Plus check to see if you have the quest. Alot of people are doing this without the quest. You have to talk to a guy in Auberdine first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this whole quest later in my paladins life.<br /><br />took m2 1 hour or so to just get the gem... 1st drop i got it, though. <br /><br />traveling is the toughest part.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well guys, this seems like it will be a snap! You guys have soloed it at level 24? That's awesome! I was gonna wait till like level 30 to do this quest, but forget it now. I'll try to get it done tommorrow. SFK is really hard though..... I can't make it past the two wolves at the beginning. Should I get a group? Becaus I'm level 25 and I saw that a level 23 soloed SFK, so he's either lying or somehow hacking. But the Kor Gem, seems super easy. Thanks guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, <br /><br />Oak, Rly easy.<br />Ore, Easy.<br />Hammer, Soloed it.<br />Gem, Soloed it, killed about 4 mobs.<br /><br />Level 26 Paladin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A lot easier than I originally had planned for. I attempted to join a part because I heard the DR was better if you did, but they were full.<br /><br />I killed the first 2 naga I saw and the 2nd one had it. Easiest quest I've ever done.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Do the quest in 1-2-3!<br /><br />1:Go to the guy in Auberdine and get the quest.<br />2:Kill VERY FEW naga oin bfd (I only needed one) to get the gem.<br />3:Go deliver the quest!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where is auberdine i cant find it smeon plz help</div>

Run down to Blackfathom Deeps, located in The Zoram Strand, on the west coast of Ashenvale.<br /><br />I just ran straight down the coast.<br /><br />3. Enter the flooded ruin, swim under the wall and stop. Here you will see a <a href="/classic/npc=4788/fallenroot-satyr">Fallenroot Satyr</a> and behind him a <a href="/classic/npc=4802/blackfathom-tide-priestess">Blackfathom Tide Priestess</a>. There is a wandering Naga that will come all the way down the hall and enter the area of these two mobs, so be aware of your pulls.<br /><br />4. Make sure that they are not too close together and pull the <a href="/classic/npc=4788/fallenroot-satyr">Fallenroot Satyr</a> using your <a href="/classic/spell=879/exorcism">Exorcism</a>.
