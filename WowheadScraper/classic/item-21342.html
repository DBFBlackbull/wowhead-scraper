If you need more than 28 fill one of the 18's, that still leaves you with 46 shards.\n\n- Someone please explain to me why you would need all the shards anyway.  A raid is 40-man max, which means no more than 37 summons should be needed.  That being said I seriously doubt you have less than 3 locks for any 40-man raid, which means you need all of 13 shards max for this.\n\n- Also why would you be using so many shards for pet summoning\/damage?  Locks have no reason to be DPS'ers.  Your DPS should only be Rogue\/Hunter\/Warrior\/Mage.  Everyone else is a healer or utility man.  Your only purpose in a raid should be Soulstones\/Healthstones.  If you wanna do damage out of boredom, just spam shadowbolts and DOT's.  The skills that require shards cause too much threat anyway and will screw up tanking!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6710</b></h3>Is there any bigger ones the expansion? I haven't seen any.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7043</b></h3>The pattern to make this bag is dropped by any of the bosses in Molten Core (excluding Ragnaros). <br />The bag in fact is quite nice for raiding warlocks that need to do multiple summons/healthstones/soulstones often and in large bulks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7266</b></h3>Nope. Currently this is the highest bag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7423</b></h3>This still is an insane amount for this bag. 16 core leather may be one guild run for people having it on farm, however, those are best used elsewhere, or sold to fund the guilds progress in my opinion.<br /><br />Coming in TBC with the new summoning stones, warlocks will get an easier time with having to summon anyway, and can use less shards hopefully</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8271</b></h3>This bag is super expensive to make and very worth it for warlocks in end game raiding who like to have their SS bag full</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Poker</b></h3>Anyone going after this bag - I'll recommend this to you. Be in a guild which is in MC and wouldn't mind giving you the excess Core Leather, as well as has a few Bloodvine in ZG. As for Felcloth, I highly doubt your guild will be that generous to you, so the best place I can recommend for you to go to farm it is not in Felwood where the Satyrs are often stalked by both Alliance and Horde farmers, but in northeast Azshara. When it comes to the Essence of Fire, there's a good chance of it dropping in UBRS (or if you're not afraid of too heavily imposing upon your guild, ask them for some from MC), while the Ironweb Spider Silk can be snagged from LBRS (spider section)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Odinn</b></h3>Ironweb Spider Silk is also a 10-20% drop off any of the spiders in Western Plaguelands, for people who prefer farming their crafting materials solo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This one dropped for our guild in Molten core yesterday just from a random trashmob, just after someone announced that it would take a long time to get a pattern drop anyways :)<br /><br />But we were lucky!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ours dropped from Garr, and the mats arnt that nuts. the core leather should be free from your guild for dkp, so should the fire essences or at least very discount (10 dropped today clearing) the felcloth i admit is outrageous but nessessary. bloodvine x6... that sucks too<br />ironweb spider silk easy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>look at how many people in MC guilds are getting this.&nbsp; if you can get the mats, just have patience and someone who you run MC with will likely get this pattern.&nbsp; don't waste gold on some jerk.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as a warlock exalted with mc --- one mc run - 28 shards more than enough<br />what about the bag , well its not a thing that is so important for a raiding lock and what about the price - well most of the guilds gather the core leathers in gbanks so u need just to have money for bloodvines , felcloth and essences</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This bag is extremely useful to me, especially in BG cause I use shadowburn alot.&nbsp; And I know, shadowburn returns a shard if the opponent is killed within 5 sec, but that doesn't always happen.&nbsp; So it's nice to have a huge stack of shards when you start.&nbsp; If you've played a lock, you know your shards can dissapear rather quickly and I say the more I can hold the better.&nbsp; Plus, the mats are far too easy to get.&nbsp; Just a few hours of farming and ask the guild for the rest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Each raiding warlock must have at least 1 such bag especially if you are not yet farming the instance. Today in MC (my first run) my usual solo set of 14 shards gone in 2 min.<br />It's like ammo punches for hunters - can't use free slots but advantages worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Come on guys, don't forget that the shard bag tells you how many shards you have left without having to hit any buttons.&nbsp; The number is right there in front of you.&nbsp; I'd say that's a pretty good reason to use a shard bag instead of a regular bag.&nbsp; Plus that fact that they're all stored neatly, and not all over the friggen place in 5 different bags, that's a good thing too right?&nbsp; And yes a lock can burn shards like NASCAR burns gas.&nbsp; So if ya got the cash and resources why not get a bigger shard bag?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For either all those non-60 warlocks and/or non-raiding warlocks, i agree this bag is expensive and hard to get.&nbsp; But for all of you that are complaining, if you raid MC on a normal basis and do ZG, these mats are easier to come by and the bag shouldnt be too hard to make.&nbsp; The slots also do make a difference. If you are in a raiding guild, it's best to have as many shards as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />btw, have the felcloth, the spider slik is easy to buy or farm up in silithus, bloodvine is easy since i have the scythe from ZG, I have the 4 essence of fire from farming the elementals in Ungoro, and since my guild runs MC on a normal basis, my GM can spare the core leather.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Get the pattern in the scholo from Jandice Barov for the 24 slot bag. More is ofcourse better, but for the time being the mat requirements for the 28 slotter are a bit excessive. Only really worth it if you raid a lot in my opinion. Things might change if the proposed stat bonus for shard bags is introduced depending on what those are going to be.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, I just want to add my 2c to the debate over whether to have this beauty or not.<br /><br />I am a 'lock in a pretty hard-core raiding guild. It is guild 'lock policy to have AT THE VERY LEAST 25-30 shards before getting to the instance. Summoning,&nbsp; Soulstoning, handing out Healthstones etc. let's say that every 'lock brings just enough shards to deal with this and they enter the instance with 0-5 shards each. <br /><br />Where are the shadowburns? Important dps spells for 'locks.<br />Where are the soulfires? Again, when not fighting immune mobs very useful.<br /><br />Having to Soul drain on every single decreases our DPS by a large amount and in all honesty, a 'locks job is to be in the top 10 on the damage meter, not top 20 because they didn't have enough shards to cope with all that's required.<br /><br />Personally I'm about to get one of these lovely bags as they simply make our lives easier. At first I was sceptical but since moving from a travelers pack to a 20-shard bag, I have noticed the difference and now can't wait.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The fact is, for most people, the core leather is going to be the most expensive part, followed by bloodvine.<br /><br />I'll say it like this: if you have to BUY the core leather, you don't need this bag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>even tho it is expensive,this is needed for raiding warlocks. If you disagree, do AQ40 after sartura and enjoy all the whispers u get for summons(and for every attempt u have to do the tunnel over and over again). and enjoy all the whispers to even get from the lazy people who decide to jack off while afk in a city somewhere after the raid was suppose to start. also u need healthstones for yourself and for the tanks that may need one (esp. if u have improved healthstone)to avoid a wipe. you may also have to summon someone if there are respawns in instances or in bwl after suppression room if there are new raid members that need summons. so if this available to u, then get it, if not&nbsp; the 24 slot shard bag isnt hard to get and far cheaper...now that i wasted sleep typing that--<br /><br />i can make 24 and 28 bag and i think 20 slot bag too...haras - burning blade -alliance</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Nice bag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Pattern drops in molten core off bosses like the other rare patterns/formulas/etc. This bag holds soul shards only, displays a number in the bottom right corner of the bag icon indicating the number of shards you have and auto-sorts shards into the bag when you drain souls.<br /><br />Very nice addition to the game though it lacks a bonus like hunter quivers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am responding to a few of these crazy comments. <br /><br />- How can you say 28 is the bare minimum? If you have all Onyxia/Bottomless bags the max number of slots you can have is 88. How many do you normally carry for a raid? If you need more than 28 fill one of the 18's, that still leaves you with 46 shards.<br /><br />- Someone please explain to me why you would need all the shards anyway. A raid is 40-man max, which means no more than 37 summons should be needed. That being said I seriously doubt you have less than 3 locks for any 40-man raid, which means you need all of 13 shards max for this.<br /><br />- Also why would you be using so many shards for pet summoning/damage? Locks have no reason to be DPS'ers. Your DPS should only be Rogue/Hunter/Warrior/Mage. Everyone else is a healer or utility man. Your only purpose in a raid should be Soulstones/Healthstones. If you wanna do damage out of boredom, just spam shadowbolts and DOT's. The skills that require shards cause too much threat anyway and will screw up tanking! You have no reason to change pets all that often either; other than summoining Doomguards.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, since no other information is given other than it is a 28 slot bag for locks only, I am guessing this is a soul shard bag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dont bring hunters into this as everytime you use 1 shard they use maybe 50 arrows <br />the bag is a good thing but have you ever thought maybe they intentionally made a limit to how many shards you can have so you dont get to overpowered its a matter of balance although that apperntly doesnt concern you as you already have 1 of the strongest classes</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>very nice</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>They were like quivers and had some bouns on them...asking too much i suppose. <br /><br />I am supa happy to finally have this tho...bout time blizz!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>But you can hold only 28 Shards. WoW ... so nice ... 28 shards, thats NOTHING ...<br />In Zul Gurub, it is one wipe ... nice ... then you give every raidmember a Healthstone an they are gone. <br /><br />Why Blizz dont make Shards Stackable ... 5 or 10, why you can't buy Shards ? Hunters can do so with their Arrows. <br /><br />Think of a Hunter who must build their Arrows an they were not stackable ... nice Idea ... or a Mage with soulbounded Water and Bread ... which do not stack ... thne finally the vendors with food an drinks make sense, and the manacakes from the argentums will be much more interesting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't see why people are saying it's so tiny. I raid with at least two other warlocks, and if we each have one of these, we can easily keep the raid supplied with stones and whatnot - after wipes or what have you. <br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting this pattern dropped so the 'locks in my guild can stop using up all their normal bagspace. Onyxia hide bags are wonderful, but I'm more than happy to switch one out for one of these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think this is a good idea, i have been using my soul pouch and love it, i would happily dish out for this when the time comes, its whole ability of moving any shards into the bag when space is freed, showing the number of shards you have and generally making life easier is invaluable.<br /><br />If it wernt for some other usefull features of necrosis then it would have been made redundant by this.<br /><br />And to the guy who said we have no reason to be DPS, think again, in the right gear we out DPS all other classes, mages..um spam frost in MC/BWL, rogues..never likes them.. warriors..take damage please..still good dps but no where near a caster....hunter..ok very good dps if played well and built well but we still win</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>28 shards is hardly a ton of shards. At best it's the bare bones number of shards a lock should venture out with. A considerable amount of Warlock ability is centered around the use of shards. And replenishment, while not hard, is not something a lock needs to focus on when in the midst of combat activities.<br />Soulstone<br />Healthstone<br />Shadowburn<br />Soulfire<br />Ritual of Summoning<br />Firestone<br />Spellstone<br />Voidwalker<br />Succi<br />Felhunter<br />Two bags of shards will still be the basic load-out now, but at least 'locks will have a decent # of shards with the new bag type available.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This bag (and all the Shard bags for that matter) is a bonus. And to try to prove otherwise is mildly amusing at best.<br /><br />If you have 4 Bottomless Bags you have (as mentioned earlier) 88 slots. With Soul Pouch 90 slots, Felcloth Bag 92 slots and Core Felcloth Bag 94 slots. Amazing, you actually have 6 slots more with the Core Felcloth Bag than you would with only Bottomless Bags.<br /><br />No one is telling you to only have Soul Shards in these bags if you need more than 24 Soul Shards for whatever - it's actually still possible to have Soul Shards in your ordinary bags as well. You just get 6 extra Soul Shards without using up anymore inventory space than you usually would. So if you usually run around with 40 or 80 Soul Shards you just have 6 more slots for loot or whatever than you would with only Bottomless Bags.<br /><br />If you can't see you bonus of that... I pity the fool. :)<br /><br />And to all the FFSOMGWTF-whiners: it's actually possible to Drain Soul in battle and you don't need to use all your Soul Shards to obtain new ones. Nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />And don't start with the whole &quot;Yeah, but Soul Shard Bags can only hold Soul Shards&quot;. True, but you need these shards. You're actually telling everyone at every possible opportunity you get that you NEED (!) at least 80 or more Soul Shards for playing. So it's really not a problem. At all. With or without these bags you cary the shards. And if you don't need the Shards, just don't get the bag. It's that simple.<br /><br />Dig?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This item will give locks yet another advantage in PvP, where shard shortages are common. Allthough the advantages in raids are obvious, the bags let locks use more abilities like soulfire and shadowburn against opposing faction players. In extended PvP conflicts like AV, this advantage cannot be overlooked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you raid, and the mats are simple as pie to come by, then sure, the 4 extra shards are worth it.<br /><br />But this bag is in no way worth the 300-400 gold I've seen it go for constantly on the AH. Seriously, if 4 shards are making that much of a difference, just train yourself to hit Drain Soul at the end of a mob's life, and spend that money on other, more useful, gear. This is in no way a &quot;high priority&quot; item.</div>
