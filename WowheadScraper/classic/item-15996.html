<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To the guy saying it only looks identical to a normal frog, well, it should. I believe it's a reference to &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; by Philip K. *!@# (adapted for the basis of Blade Runner.) In the book a toad is found, and is of course incredibly life-like, but unfortunately turns out to be just an ersatz animal, it's even found in a barren wasteland-esque area, too. If it is a reference, and the fact that it even has 'lifelike' in the name which leads me to believe it is, then it should look quite identical to a real toad. I personally would like to get one of therse in game, myself, as I'm a big PKD fan; I think the real 'cool' factor here is if you're a fan of the book and stumble on this more so than just the visual appearance of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>...Lifelike Mechanical Toad.&nbsp; Name says it all.&nbsp; It can be a little disappointing, but I'm dying for this schematic.&nbsp; I'm building a full menagerie of all the clockwork critters, and the toad is a gem.<br /><br />Of course, it's a drain on resources, and it looks normal.&nbsp; It's still windup, and that makes it cooler than a cyborg ninja zombie pirate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well.<br />12 thorium bars (on ah usally a 20bar are sold at 7g)<br />4 runecloth<br />1 living essence<br />1 gold power core<br />1 rugged leather.<br /><br />If you buy everything you need on Auction House this will cost you about 9-10 in a lucky day. I have made one for personal use, and of course it looks funny to see a a toad jumping around and following you during raids or an istance. You can joke about and tell your friends &quot;hey, look at my new friend, I have made it and he looks like real :D&quot;. But I really think mechanical squirrel looks better. The point is: everyone can have a mechanical squirrel, couse of low level recipe (35 in engineering, will be one of your first works and one of your first bought pattern) but very few people can have this toad. Why? look at the prices, look at the drop rate of the recipe, look at the price of the recipe in AH. And it needs 265 in engineering, so you will need to find a skilled engineer (suppose a lvl 50+ engineer that can find materials and the recipe) willing to do this.<br /><br />How much I would sell it on AH? 14 gold starting bid and about 18-20 gold buyout. Noone works for free...and you will be a cool player on your server, right? :D<br /><br />Drakdaedaren<br />eu-aszune</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this schem for 50g-ish on the AH. Definitely worth it, because I consider it a personal hobby to collect every schematic in the game, and this one surely is a gem. <br /><br />Just need to get me a living essence to make one..<br /><br />And for the record; it is in fact the coolest due to its unique-ness.</div>
