This pattern is sold by Qia one at a time on an apparently unknown restock rate. It may or may not share a restock with the other 3 patterns sold by Qia (Formula for Enchant Chest Major Health, Pattern for Frostsaber Boots, and Pattern for Runecloth gloves). I've heard anecdotally from others farming the vendor that the rate at which it restocks can be as quick as 1 minute from the last recipe restocking. \n\nWhat I CAN tell you is what I experienced in my short time farming the recipe, and give you some useful tips for how to snipe the pattern before the other 5 people waiting for it.\n\nFirst thing you wanna do is open your key bindings and go to the Targeting tab. Set a key for Interact With Target. This will save you the trouble of having to right click Qia with enemy faction players around you and catching a nice quick death from the goblins for accidentally auto attacking someone. IMO, it's also just faster than right clicking.\n\nNext you wanna make a new macro:\n[code]\/run BuyMerchantItem(30,1)[\/code]\n\nThis will buy 1 item that is in the 30th slot on the vendor, which is where the recipe will populate in the vendor page. Something to note: since this macro doesn't discriminate by item name (and I don't think there's a way to accomplish that) 75% of the time, you'll be buying of the other 4 recipes. This may or may not be a deal breaker for you, but you can possibly sell them back on the AH for a profit, and I can almost guarantee that this method will be cheaper than buying the recipe from the ah at the time I'm posting this (about 35g Incendius-Horde(US)). There may be a chance for a second recipe to restock at the same time, I haven't been able to confirm this, but in that scenario add a second line with the same code and change 30 to 31.\n\nNow target Qia, put your macro next to your interact key binding, and S P A M. Interact, Macro, Escape (to close the window but keep Qia targetted, clicking out of the window would be fine too). In my own experience, patterns take either 15, 20, or 30 minutes to restock, but again, that timeframe is from my own experience spamming this as fast as I could for about 3 hours. Another note: you may be able to leave the window open, but from my observation, for you to be able to buy the pattern you have to have opened the window after the pattern had restocked, not before.

It took a while for the runecloth bag pattern to drop, initially I camped the npc checking every minute for about 2 hours at 5am server time and there was almost no one around but still no pattern. After that I would just take the flightpath to winterspring whenever I needed to do crafting and the next day I went to the npc and the pattern was there. The npc is definitely camped from time to time since the pattern sells for about 60g on my server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ktmage</b></h3>In order to see the limited supply recipe do I need to close and reopen the vendor or can i just sit with it open and hover over the spot? Thank you</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HalfCell</b></h3>So here's the deal my classic friends. This pattern is sold by Qia one at a time on an apparently unknown restock rate. It may or may not share a restock with the other 3 patterns sold by Qia (Formula for Enchant Chest Major Health, Pattern for Frostsaber Boots, and Pattern for Runecloth gloves). I've heard anecdotally from others farming the vendor that the rate at which it restocks can be as quick as 1 minute from the last recipe restocking. <br /><br />What I CAN tell you is what I experienced in my short time farming the recipe, and give you some useful tips for how to snipe the pattern before the other 5 people waiting for it.<br /><br />First thing you wanna do is open your key bindings and go to the Targeting tab. Set a key for Interact With Target. This will save you the trouble of having to right click Qia with enemy faction players around you and catching a nice quick death from the goblins for accidentally auto attacking someone. IMO, it's also just faster than right clicking.<br /><br />Next you wanna make a new macro:<br />/run BuyMerchantItem(30,1)<br /><br />This will buy 1 item that is in the 30th slot on the vendor, which is where the recipe will populate in the vendor page. Something to note: since this macro doesn't discriminate by item name (and I don't think there's a way to accomplish that) 75% of the time, you'll be buying of the other 4 recipes. This may or may not be a deal breaker for you, but you can possibly sell them back on the AH for a profit, and I can almost guarantee that this method will be cheaper than buying the recipe from the ah at the time I'm posting this (about 35g Incendius-Horde(US)). There may be a chance for a second recipe to restock at the same time, I haven't been able to confirm this, but in that scenario add a second line with the same code and change 30 to 31.<br /><br />Now target Qia, put your macro next to your interact key binding, and S P A M. Interact, Macro, Escape (to close the window but keep Qia targetted, clicking out of the window would be fine too). In my own experience, patterns take either 15, 20, or 30 minutes to restock, but again, that timeframe is from my own experience spamming this as fast as I could for about 3 hours. Another note: you may be able to leave the window open, but from my observation, for you to be able to buy the pattern you have to have opened the window after the pattern had restocked, not before. I DO know that leaving the window open and spamming the buy macro will D/C you from the server, so avoid doing that.<br /><br />That's it everyone, that's all I know. I got 3 of the Enchants and 1 Pattern for Frostsaber Boots before I got this pattern, but I can confirm this method is pretty effective. Good luck out there, and happy farming. - Halfcell Incendius-Horde(US)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stronghoof</b></h3>I just want to throw in my two cents, for anyone curious about the restock time. Your mileage may vary, but I purchased my bag pattern approximately 8 and a half minutes after I bought one of the other limited supply patterns. So for me it was a short restock, but it is entirely possible that it will be shorter or longer for you. I just wanted to let people know that ~8:30 is in the realm of possibility. Happy hunting, and good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>neolithicau</b></h3>Posting here because this is important: <b>all of the people saying to spam buy slot 30 are only partially correct</b>. The vendor will <b>ADD ADDITIONAL PAGES</b> if all of the patterns are in stock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>strokess</b></h3>I just camped Qia for an hour and there are around 15 minute spawn times for items and it is correct; however, they do not all spawn in her merchant window at once. They seem to rotate... <br /><br />So I bought a before the Pattern: Runecloth Bag appeared. It seems like a tough purchase b/c before that it was the Pattern: Frostsaber Boots, that someone else had purchased shortly after when I first arrived. I was camping the merchant Qia with a Horde Mage toon there, Snefru &lt;The OranThul&gt;, who was there for longer. When I purchased the item, he attacked me, was then attacked by the town guards, and hearthed out in frustration I guess. I purchased it while he was AFK for a short period of time...<br /><br />UPDATE: I camped a little more and 15-minutes later I bought <br /><br />Also using:<br /><br />/run BuyMerchantItem(30,1)<br /><br />Will only purchase whatever is on item 30; so it's literally whatever that spawn item is at the time. You cannot just keep the window open it seems, you have to shut the window and re-engage the NPC Qia each time to refresh the item re-spawn. So lots of waiting and clicking!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Orenorie</b></h3>1 button spam method to obtain this recipe:<br /><br />1. Run the following script (it will fit in a macro if you would like to save it as one):<br />/script local f=CreateFrame(&quot;FRAME&quot;);f:RegisterEvent(&quot;MERCHANT_SHOW&quot;);f:SetScript(&quot;OnEvent&quot;,function(s, e, ...) for i=1,31 do local l=GetMerchantItemLink(i);if l and l:find(&quot;Pattern: Runecloth Bag&quot;) then BuyMerchantItem(i,1);end end CloseMerchant();end);<br /><br />2. Set an Interact With Target button (Key Bindings &gt; Targeting -&gt; Interact With Target)<br />3 Target Qia (/target Qia if needed)<br />4. Spam your Interact With Target button<br />5. When done reload your UI to disable the script (/reload)<br /><br />This script will set your game up to automatically loop though all of the vendors items looking only for the Runecloth Bag pattern, and buying it if found. It will then automatically close the merchant window when it has checked each item.<br /><br />Credit for the script goes to the other posters who each had different parts of it, I just took them and combined them together.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grishord</b></h3>Exactly 20 minutes after I bought the enchant recipe the bag recipe spawned. So it seems like it's at least on an integral of 5 minutes, be it 10, 20, 25, etc based on other comments.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jokar93</b></h3>Check your Auction House first.<br /><br />I ended up paying more, buying the recipes from the Vendor until the right one came up, compared to just buying it from the Auction House.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JayAustin</b></h3>I stayed up late and clicked on her repeatedly for approximately 45 minutes, with no change in patterns available. Then in the span of about 15 minutes, I got the glove pattern, an enchantment, and finally the runecloth bag pattern. Finding a quiet time and checking in every few minutes seems to do the trick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Furydeath</b></h3>everyone says it's hard to get I got two in the last 2 hours no one is camping it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>oogumboogum</b></h3>So what I did was used a couple of the macro's found in the comments together to help figure this thing out.<br /><br />/run for i=1,GetMerchantNumItems() do local l=GetMerchantItemLink(i) if l then if l:find(&quot;Pattern: Runecloth Gloves&quot;) then BuyMerchantItem(i, 1)end end end<br />/run PickupMerchantItem(30,1)<br /><br />This will purchase the Runecloth bag recipe if it is up, it will also pickup an item that is limited quantity simply as a flag to see what has appeared.<br /><br />For example I was spamming this macro over and over but I also wanted to know if there was a limited quantity item other than the bag. So when an item in box 30 showed up it would change my icon in game to the item from the vendor (simply pick it up temporarily). This was mostly due to testing if there could be more than 1 item. So far I have seen 2 items appear at the same time, the enchant and LW recipe. Someone mentioned they saw 3 at once so it seems as though just using the original macro will work just fine and <b>there is no need to buyout any item you do not need to &quot;provoke&quot; the next item because it does not have a rotation</b>.<br /><br />Also worth noting that I had 2 items appear within 2 minutes of eachother.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GrimTimA</b></h3>I was sitting here for 22 minutes. No one came up to the vendor. I am in HC (pre Blizzard HC). I don't think there are people 'not visible' (sharding). But no one is here at the vendor. I am seeing the recipes that are limited, disappear with no one in this town.<br /><br />I thought the only way they disappear is after they are purchased.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gogurtpie</b></h3>Oct-05-2023 on Defias Pillager (HC) server<br /><br />I was the only person camping her.<br /><br />12:50 PM started camping Qia<br />1:44 PM got Runecloth Gloves pattern<br />1:54 PM got Enchant Chest Major Health <br />2:21 PM got Frostsaber boots<br />2:27 PM got Runecloth Gloves pattern<br />2:42 PM got Enchant Chest Major Health<br />2:52 PM got Runecloth Gloves pattern<br />3:01 PM got Enchant Chest Major Health<br />3:15 PM got<b> Runecloth Bag pattern</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dainn</b></h3>How is this on the auction house already in SoD?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KingGelbin</b></h3>IF YOU ARE PLAYING SOD. Don't think you're just going to show up and buy this pattern. All the Chads buy these patterns up and then list them on AH for exorbitant amounts of gold. This type of behavior shouldn't be allowed in game. You buy 1 AND THAT'S IT! You will have to wait for a re-spawn timer for this pattern to become available again. Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>brockWoWsamson</b></h3>lol @ the baddies in the comments saying all patterns/recipe should be BoP because they are salty.<br /><br />gray parses detected.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>roofboy179</b></h3>Since I haven't seen any recent comments about the one-click spam macro that Orenorie posted, I wanted to confirm that it DOES still work on the Anniversary fresh classic realms. It took me upwards of 5 hours total spamming that macro but I eventually got my recipe and was able to circumvent paying the 60g gouging on the AH!</div>
