<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tetris</b></h3>I got one off of a Stone Guardian, which is probably the easiest way to solo grind for the enchant, seems to be very rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vargh</b></h3>Can drop from Azuregos, Onyxia and Lord Kazzak aswell. Verry rare enchant, also verry expensive.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10215</b></h3>Very rare indeed. Dropped for me from an Eternium Box from BWL trash as one of the very last enchants I was missing (pre-BC of course). Basy @ Hellscream EU, Alliance side. I charge 5g for any enchant I can do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>16975</b></h3>Found 2 on stone guardians (can now be trained from trainer :/ ).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got this formula from an eternium lockbox in ubrs.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got it from an Eternium Lockbox out of Ubrs too.<br />Didnt know whats its worth until the people in the guildchat went crazy ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For instance, as a rogue this enchant is similar in value to the Superior Health enchant.&nbsp; The reason being I only benifit from 2.5 of the stats (agi/sta, and str is only marginally useful).&nbsp; I imagine it would be similar other full melee class, like say a warrior.&nbsp; Pure casters are in a similar boat with only getting much out of int/sta and marginaly from spirit.<br /><br />All that goes out the window though when you consider a hybrid class.&nbsp; Hunters, Shaman, Paladins, and Druids all receive far more benefit from +4 to all stats than +100 health or mana.&nbsp; For them this is hands down the best enchant available.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Something some people seem to fail to realise is the difference between a good enchant, and the best enchant.<br /><br />A good enchant might cost 5-10 gold. The best enchant might cost 50-100g. The later is obviously intended for end-game gear.<br /><br />Say I was a druid decked out in cenarion gear (epic tier1 set) and could select +3 stats for 10g or +4 stats for 100g. I'd go with +4 stats without a doubt.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What is missing from the minds of those who do not understand either point of upgrade or pricing of high level enchantments. <br /><br />The materials used to make an enchantment at endgame are usually more numerous, rarer (Righteous Orbs, anyone?) or stemming from expensive equipment. Also, in order to perform higher level enchantments an Enchanter must create a more powerful rod. This is why simply providing materials does in fact cause us to lose money. We're lowering our customer pool by providing a service that cost us our gold.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are wondering why you should spend the large difference between +50 armor to cloak or +70 armor to coak, or between +3 weapon damage and +5 weapon damage, you shouldn't. That is, unless you want to squeeze out that last bit of additional power out over your peers and, in fact, your enemies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>People need to stop and think for a second.<br /><br />This is not a useless enchant by any measure, and being as I'm hung up on the decision myself right now I can understand why anyone would consider it.&nbsp; I want to put +100 HP on my chest piece however I could also use mana, and I'm kinda down on Agility.&nbsp; Hrm.<br /><br />No, +4 in a stat isn't huge, and sure the mats required are substantial, but then again I have a massive pile of materials in my bank that aren't going anywhere anyway.&nbsp; I may as well put them to good use.&nbsp; With the stats I'm covering all my options... sure a little less than half of what I'd get with other choices, but that's the price you pay for getting <i>everything</i>.&nbsp; Would I rather have an enchant that does +100 HP, +150MP, and +1% crit chance all in one?<br /><br />Sure, but that's just not going to happen.<br /><br />-X</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>...<br />+4 Int = 66 Mana (if skilled) + Crit<br />+4 Spi = more Manaregen (even in battle if skilled)<br />+4 to all others = see above</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can think it's not worth it if you like, that's obviously a personal call.&nbsp; But it's the difference between settling for good enough, and being the best.&nbsp; For top geared people, what else are you going to spend your money on?<br /><br />It wasn't that hard or expensive to gather the mats for.&nbsp; I paid the enchanter 25g for it, and I've loved it ever since.&nbsp; If you think it's not worth it, so be it.&nbsp; But it was a small price to pay to know that I've given myself as much extra edge as I possibly can.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>+3 was really never enough to top +100 Health.<br /><br />+4 is just enough to make it worth it, for a Warrior that's:<br /><br />+40 Health<br />+8 Attack Power<br />+.2% to crit<br />And some Intellect and Spirit for kicks<br /><br />It's sort of 10 stats from the +100 health vs 12 usefull stats on the Greater Stats enchant.<br /><br />Only really worth it on the best of chests, probably be best used on a Druid who can make use of all the stats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Id say this is far better for healers than +100 mana, cos of the +4 int (60mana) +4 spiri for regen and +4 stam (+40HP), far better imo, and as a shammy +4 Agil gives more armor, crit abd dodge so!<br /><br />I really think blizz should do something about the lack of chest chants, a 3/4/5 mana per 5sec regen would be more welcome methinks, along with a +45 healing or something, and spell dmg.<br /><br />However i recommend +3 to all stats for cheapness! unless u got T2 chest (depending on class) I wouldnt bother putting anything other than +3 on, as you wont keep it that long.<br /><br />Give more chants, buff shammies :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just got it from an eternium lockbox i found in ZG. Gave to friend's enchanter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I believe it dropped in Legion Hold or Illidary Point. Didn't really notice it at the time, then read it and thought it may be a decent enchant. giving it to a buddy so he'll enchant my stuff. All in all i think a +4 on every stat is better than a kick in the nuts(pretty good), not sure I'd pay 100g for the recipe though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, here the other day i was grinding with my mage in Hearthglen, AOE grinding etc. I saw the paladin boss there spawned, so i decided to kill him as usual. BUT this time he dropped this formula, at that point only two people on horde side could enchant this (and one of them has just transfered to another server) so i was like &quot;woah, this gotta be worth a lot!&quot;. So i say in one of my old guild channels that i had found that formula. And all of a sudden, people i have never even talked to, started to whispering me about selling the formula. I ended up with selling it to a guild called &quot;hybris&quot; for a price of 1500g, i have the feeling i could have gotten even more for it though :/<br /><br />So a little tip: If you find it, talk to some of the major guilds and don't let the price go below 1500 :&gt;</div>
