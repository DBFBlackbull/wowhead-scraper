Note that this does not take into account the other items that can be fished from tastyfish spawns (stranglekelp, oily blackmouths, ect), so a more accurate description would be for any number of tastyfish caught, an average of x% will be rare, where x is the following:\n\n[b]Keefer's Angelfish: 0.25%[\/b] (1 in every 400 tastyfish)\n\n[b]Dezien Queenfish: 0.22%[\/b] (1 in every 450 tastyfish)\n\n[b]Brownell's Blue Striped Racer : 0.18%[\/b] (1 in every 550 tastyfish)\n\n[b]ANY rare fish: 0.65%[\/b] (1 in every 150 tastyfish)\n\nSo if you were to catch 100 tastyfish every Sunday (which is about how many I usually get), you would have a 20% chance to get the Dezien Queenfish, or a 48% chance to get any rare fish.&nbsp; Personally, I've probably caught around 750-1000 tastyfish, and have found 3 x Dezien Queenfish.&nbsp; My chance of finding an angelfish (the one I want) with that many caught is somewhere around 90%.&nbsp; I shall keep on trying...\n\nI don't see why Blizzard would make the droprates different for each individual fish, so we can probably assume that they share the same rate (The average is 0.22%).&nbsp; With this in mind, there is obviously a rather large margain of error for these rates.&nbsp; This is because there is very little data on thottbot for the fishing competition (only a total of 233 rare fish are recorded at this time).&nbsp; If you wish to help, run thottbot while you farm and upload your data.","date":"2007-01-02T03:01:00-06:00","rating":264,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"What on earth does this post have to do with High test Eternium fishing line?

I cannot wait until my collection is complete! <br /><br /><a href="http://ctprofiles.net/3208451" rel="nofollow">http://ctprofiles.net/3208451 </a><br /><br />Need fishing Data? check out: <br /><a href="http://web.mac.com/skwidspawn/iWeb/Fishing/Welcome.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.mac.com/skwidspawn/iWeb/Fishing/Welcome.html</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does the rare fish go away after 1 hour of the comp and can u give it 2 fishbot then?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All the tournament fish (tastyfish and all of the rare fish) will show a timer towards the end of the tournament.&nbsp; It can be up to 4 hours, but even if you catch a fish at 3:45 it won't last a week and the turn-in NPCs disappear at 5:00PM game time.&nbsp; You must turn everything you catch in by 5 or it won't last until the next week.<br /><br />The questions I have are about applying this line:<br /><br />-Does the pole you apply to become soulbound even if it wasn't before? (Big Iron/Strong Poles)<br />-Can you apply it in the &quot;Not to be Traded&quot; box like an enchant to give it to someone else?<br /><br />Edit: answers.<br />-You can apply it to poles in your inventory, if the pole wasn't soulbound before, it won't become soulbound when you add Eternium Line to it so you can add it to a Big Iron/Strong Pole and still trade it off when you outgrow it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, I did these stats AGAIN, please upvote this post so it doesn't get deleted another time.&nbsp; Since people didn't seem to understand how I got these numbers before, I will explain them.<br /><br />When thottbot tracks data, it does not (and probably cannot) record conditions such as if a fishing bobber was inside a tastyfish spawn.&nbsp; Therefore, it isn't possible to get a &quot;droprate&quot; for the fish.&nbsp; So, the only way to get a feel for how often the rare fish drop is to compare its data to that of tastyfish, since tastyfish are the only other item caught exclusively under the exact same conditions as the rare fish.&nbsp; Fortunately, we know the number of tastyfish that have been caught, as well as how many rare fish.<br /><br />This logic would be flawed if, for example, tastyfish could be caught in the competition long before rare fish were added, therefore making the tastyfish seem more common.&nbsp; Since, to my knowledge, the rare fish always have been there since the competition started, we can simply divide the number of rare fish caught by the number of tastyfish. Note that this does not take into account the other items that can be fished from tastyfish spawns (stranglekelp, oily blackmouths, ect), so a more accurate description would be for any number of tastyfish caught, an average of x% will be rare, where x is the following:<br /><br /><b>Keefer's Angelfish: 0.25%</b> (1 in every 400 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>Dezien Queenfish: 0.22%</b> (1 in every 450 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>Brownell's Blue Striped Racer : 0.18%</b> (1 in every 550 tastyfish)<br /><br /><b>ANY rare fish: 0.65%</b> (1 in every 150 tastyfish)<br /><br />So if you were to catch 100 tastyfish every Sunday (which is about how many I usually get), you would have a 20% chance to get the Dezien Queenfish, or a 48% chance to get any rare fish.&nbsp; Personally, I've probably caught around 750-1000 tastyfish, and have found 3 x Dezien Queenfish.&nbsp; My chance of finding an angelfish (the one I want) with that many caught is somewhere around 90%.&nbsp; I shall keep on trying...<br /><br />I don't see why Blizzard would make the droprates different for each individual fish, so we can probably assume that they share the same rate (The average is 0.22%).&nbsp; With this in mind, there is obviously a rather large margain of error for these rates.&nbsp; This is because there is very little data on thottbot for the fishing competition (only a total of 233 rare fish are recorded at this time).&nbsp; If you wish to help, run thottbot while you farm and upload your data.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Adds +5 fishing to your rod. <br />Cant be removed.<br />Stacks with temporary lures.<br /><br />Going for those rares seems worth it.<br />I got a +5 hat and a +5 line outta it..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>what does it do? I added it to my Big Iron Fishing pole but it still says +20 fishing..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The more important question is, can you enchant another person's fishing pole through a trade window? That could get you a couple of pesos.<br /><br />The effect in-game is that you have a higher probability of not losing a fish in a high-level fishing area. Example: the Bay of Storms fishing area requires roughly 375 fishing just to cast out, and more like 425 to consistently catch without losing a fish on the line. I'm up to 342 with all of my gear, so I still have to use Aquadynamic Fish Attractors. Once I'm up to 352 with all three rares, the arc pole and the glove enchant, I can switch to baubles to fish the zone instead of having to make Fish Attractors.<br /><br />I picked this up yesterday and popped it on my Arcanite pole. Now if I can just get the other two rares....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>so is this only to be obtained during the fishing contests or is it possible to get it aleways ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So... What is the effect in game-terms?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've applied it to my big iron fishing pole (+20). Now it has an extra line saying &quot;Ethernium Fishing Line&quot;, but the bonus is still 20.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if i put this on my fishing pole, does it make the fishing pole soulbound?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>+5 Fishing skill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Though it is not schowed on pole itself but you can see on your skills tab that this line increases your fishing skill by 5. Once used it can <b>not</b> be moved to other pole, its like enchant.<br />Just today i won my 2nd contest and thus attaining maximal fishing level of 452 - Ashbringer, here i come ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My seven time participating contest, but still not won main prize, but got this one. It doesn't say &quot;+5 fishing&quot; and my pole still adds +20 as it was, at least it looks like this, but when i'm casting my fishing line now is not black as it was, but it blue one... some one said &quot;it's stackable&quot;, so i'm wondering if i won't arcanite fishing rod, can i move that line to a new rod... hm.... :/</div>
