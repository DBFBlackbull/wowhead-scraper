I got it for [url=http:\/\/armory.worldofwarcraft.com\/#character-sheet.xml?r=Boulderfist&n=Shemozzle]my 29 twink[\/url].\n\n[b]How do you get the turtle mount?[\/b] Officially, you buy World of Warcraft Trading Card Game (TCG) packs. The turtle mount is a [i]loot card[\/i], also known as a [i]legendary card[\/i]. I however have no interest in these cards, so got it off ebay. There's a code on the card you can use to claim your reward.\n\nEDIT: There is a [i]non-legendary[\/i] turtle card, it's just an ordinary card with no code on it. RRP of 50 cents on ebay. Added this in to clear any confusion.\n\n[b]OMFG you actually paid money for this? You must be a loser get a gf.[\/b] Actually, my gf bought this for me off ebay as a present. What can I say, she supports my hobby.\n\n[b]Lucky bastard! But you still wasted your money![\/b] Again, I like to think of it as a hobby. Hobbies cost money.\n\n[b]So what are the odds of getting this legendary card from a pack?[\/b] Lots of different people are quoting lots of different odds. I don't think anyone knows for sure. For what it's worth, I believe 1 in 48 booster packs. If you're only interested in the turtle, your cheapest option is ebay.\n\n[b]Is there a level requirement to ride this turtle?[\/b] No. A level 1 can ride this.\n\n[b]Can all of my characters use the turtle once I have the code?[\/b] No. One code per character. If you want all 5 of your characters to be riding on a turtle, then you're going to have to buy 5 separate loot cards. The turtle is [u]soulbound[\/u] once you claim it.\n\n[b]Can you tell me the code to get the turtle? Plzzz omg.[\/b] Even if I did, it wouldn't work. Once you use the code it's expired.\n\n[b]Is it possible to hack the code so I can get a free turtle?[\/b] Good luck! I'm sure blizzard have gone to great lengths to ensure their promotional rewards cannot be hacked. \n\n[u]PRACTICAL:[\/u]\n[b]How fast is the turtle?[\/b] It is normal running speed. In other words it is 0% faster. It multiplies your running speed by 1.00.\n\n[b]Can I make the turtle go faster?[\/b] Here's the juicy stuff. You can skip this if you don't care.\n\nSay you have [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/spell=13890\/enchant-boots-minor-speed]Enchant Boots - Minor Speed[\/url] on your boots (or any of the AB boots). That gives an 8% running speed boost. Does this make your turtle go 8% faster? NO! If you're twinking, having the running speed enchant is fairly standard, so you will be going [i]slower[\/i] than all the other twinks.\n\nBut wait, all is not lost. There is [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/spell=13947\/enchant-gloves-riding-skill]Enchant Gloves - Riding Skill[\/url] and [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/item=7969]Mithril Spurs[\/url] that a twink could use to up the turtle's speed. Do these actually work and make your turtle go faster? YES! (There's also carrot on a stick and riding crop, but I'm only interested in twinks here.)\n\nSO, how fast do you go if you use the riding skill enchant on your gloves AND the mithril spurs on your boots?\n\n[ul]\n  [li]Riding Skill Enchant is an extra 2%\n[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n[ul]\n  [li]Mithril Spurs is an extra 4%\n[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n[ul]\n  [li]Final Speed = Turtle speed * enchant * spurs\n[\/li]\n[\/ul]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 1.00 * 1.02 * 1.04\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 1.0608\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [i]= 6.08% faster[\/i]\n\n[i]In other words you'll be going 1.92% slower than your twink friends.[\/i]\n(The above calculations are correct, please do not argue otherwise.)\n\nIf you're not twinking and have carrot on a stick IN ADDITION to the enchant and spurs, you can make your turtle go 9.2624% faster. If you have riding crop, you can make your turtle go 10% faster. You cannot make it go any faster than 10% using these items.\n\n[b]Can I use items or trinkets while on the turtle mount?[\/b] No. It's like a regular mount in this respect.\n\n[b]Can druids use the mount while shapeshifted, or can I use the mount while under the effects of noggenfogger or any other shape changing effect?[\/b] No. You cannot mount while shapeshifted. It's just like a regular mount in this respect.\n\n[b]Can the turtle swim through or above the water?[\/b] This would be cool, but unfortunately not.\n\n[b]Can I pick up the (outdoor) \"speed boots bonus\" in AB while on this mount?[\/b] You can, but they'll have no effect. It'll just use up the bonus. The \"healing\" and \"berserker\" bonuses do work though.\n\n[b]Can I run with the WSG flag, or cap a node in AB while on this mount?[\/b] No. It's like a regular mount in this respect.\n\n[b]What mods are compatible with the turtle mount?[\/b] I had no luck in getting SimpleMountEquip 1.8 or ItemRack 1.9x to recognise the mount.\n\nQuickMountEquip 3.0.7 and Auto FlightPath Unmount on the other hand had no problems.\n\nI haven't tested any other mount mods, but at least you know those 2 work.\n\n[u]OTHER:[\/u]\n[b]Do you get asked a lot about the turtle in game?[\/b] Yes.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>23914</b></h3>Should be noted, as this is a mount it can be affected by +mount speed items. I know this doesn't really mean a lot but if you have a talent (Eg. Pursuit of justice or Animal Handler) you may be able to mildly increase your mounted speed at lower levels. Plus the mithril spurs and glove enchant could come in handy.<br />Most you can get at low levels is glove enchant (+2%) and mithril spurs (+4%) so that means you can make your mount speed 106%... which is actually slower than a minor speed enchant...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Even though this item is &quot;Level 20&quot;, there is no restriction on what level you need to be&nbsp; in order to use it.&nbsp; My 19 twink is riding around on his right now!&nbsp; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was just wondering if you can get this on more than one toon.&nbsp; I want to get it for my twink but it would be hot to have with my main also.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So say your twink has the minor speed enchant to their boots. Does riding this turtle make you go at normal speed, or normal speed + enchant speed?<br /><br />I suspect it's the former, which means your twink will be going slower than they should be. Not good.<br /><br />EDIT: Also I've read rumours that mithril spurs/riding enchant to gloves effect the speed. Is this true? I would like to see someone with the mount do some tests and post convincing results.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yea mount speed bonuses make you go slower. o.O<br /><br />If you have the Riding Crop, Carrot on a stick or any of the other items that make your mount go faster (Some of them don't stack together), it will be your mount's normal speed + the bonus. For example, the riding crop makes you ride 10% faster, so if you're on a level 40 mount, the mount will go at 70% speed. The level 60(100%) mount will go at 110% speed. <br /><br />About the Riding Turtle, it might be a silly thought, but I haven't seen anyone mention this before. What about if you can swim with it? Only someone who has it on the original servers can say the answer to that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What do we play this game for if not loot? We raid for loot. We rep grind for loot. We spend countless hours playing this game for pixels. Extra pixels on the chest / shoulders / feet of another block of pixels. If someone wants to waste more time and money for another block of pixels, let them. This game all leads to loot, and this is just extra loot.<br />Fyi: 1) this is useable on a character of any level.<br />2) the max speed you can move with this mount is run speed. 3) you cant hack the code to obtain this mount. I'm sure blizzard hasnt overlooked this, and this idea was probably thought up by some 12 year old with an IQ of 20.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><u>GENERAL:</u><br /><b>Why should we listen to you?</b> I got the turtle mount recently and have done lots of testing. I got it for <a href="http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-sheet.xml?r=Boulderfist&amp;n=Shemozzle" rel="nofollow">my 29 twink</a>.<br /><br /><b>How do you get the turtle mount?</b> Officially, you buy World of Warcraft Trading Card Game (TCG) packs. The turtle mount is a <i>loot card</i>, also known as a <i>legendary card</i>. I however have no interest in these cards, so got it off ebay. There's a code on the card you can use to claim your reward.<br /><br />EDIT: There is a <i>non-legendary</i> turtle card, it's just an ordinary card with no code on it. RRP of 50 cents on ebay. Added this in to clear any confusion.<br /><br /><b>OMFG you actually paid money for this? You must be a loser get a gf.</b> Actually, my gf bought this for me off ebay as a present. What can I say, she supports my hobby.<br /><br /><b>Lucky bastard! But you still wasted your money!</b> Again, I like to think of it as a hobby. Hobbies cost money.<br /><br /><b>So what are the odds of getting this legendary card from a pack?</b> Lots of different people are quoting lots of different odds. I don't think anyone knows for sure. For what it's worth, I believe 1 in 48 booster packs. If you're only interested in the turtle, your cheapest option is ebay.<br /><br /><b>Is there a level requirement to ride this turtle?</b> No. A level 1 can ride this.<br /><br /><b>Can all of my characters use the turtle once I have the code?</b> No. One code per character. If you want all 5 of your characters to be riding on a turtle, then you're going to have to buy 5 separate loot cards. The turtle is <u>soulbound</u> once you claim it.<br /><br /><b>Can you tell me the code to get the turtle? Plzzz omg.</b> Even if I did, it wouldn't work. Once you use the code it's expired.<br /><br /><b>Is it possible to hack the code so I can get a free turtle?</b> Good luck! I'm sure blizzard have gone to great lengths to ensure their promotional rewards cannot be hacked. <br /><br /><u>PRACTICAL:</u><br /><b>How fast is the turtle?</b> It is normal running speed. In other words it is 0% faster. It multiplies your running speed by 1.00.<br /><br /><b>Can I make the turtle go faster?</b> Here's the juicy stuff. You can skip this if you don't care.<br /><br />Say you have <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13890/enchant-boots-minor-speed">Enchant Boots - Minor Speed</a> on your boots (or any of the AB boots). That gives an 8% running speed boost. Does this make your turtle go 8% faster? NO! If you're twinking, having the running speed enchant is fairly standard, so you will be going <i>slower</i> than all the other twinks.<br /><br />But wait, all is not lost. There is <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13947/enchant-gloves-riding-skill">Enchant Gloves - Riding Skill</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7969">Mithril Spurs</a> that a twink could use to up the turtle's speed. Do these actually work and make your turtle go faster? YES! (There's also carrot on a stick and riding crop, but I'm only interested in twinks here.)<br /><br />SO, how fast do you go if you use the riding skill enchant on your gloves AND the mithril spurs on your boots?<br /><br /><ul><li>Riding Skill Enchant is an extra 2%<br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li>Mithril Spurs is an extra 4%<br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li>Final Speed = Turtle speed * enchant * spurs<br /></li></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 1.00 * 1.02 * 1.04<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 1.0608<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>= 6.08% faster</i><br /><br /><i>In other words you'll be going 1.92% slower than your twink friends.</i><br />(The above calculations are correct, please do not argue otherwise.)<br /><br />If you're not twinking and have carrot on a stick IN ADDITION to the enchant and spurs, you can make your turtle go 9.2624% faster. If you have riding crop, you can make your turtle go 10% faster. You cannot make it go any faster than 10% using these items.<br /><br /><b>Can I use items or trinkets while on the turtle mount?</b> No. It's like a regular mount in this respect.<br /><br /><b>Can druids use the mount while shapeshifted, or can I use the mount while under the effects of noggenfogger or any other shape changing effect?</b> No. You cannot mount while shapeshifted. It's just like a regular mount in this respect.<br /><br /><b>Can the turtle swim through or above the water?</b> This would be cool, but unfortunately not.<br /><br /><b>Can I pick up the (outdoor) &quot;speed boots bonus&quot; in AB while on this mount?</b> You can, but they'll have no effect. It'll just use up the bonus. The &quot;healing&quot; and &quot;berserker&quot; bonuses do work though.<br /><br /><b>Can I run with the WSG flag, or cap a node in AB while on this mount?</b> No. It's like a regular mount in this respect.<br /><br /><b>What mods are compatible with the turtle mount?</b> I had no luck in getting SimpleMountEquip 1.8 or ItemRack 1.9x to recognise the mount.<br /><br />QuickMountEquip 3.0.7 and Auto FlightPath Unmount on the other hand had no problems.<br /><br />I haven't tested any other mount mods, but at least you know those 2 work.<br /><br /><u>OTHER:</u><br /><b>Do you get asked a lot about the turtle in game?</b> Yes. If people ask where I got it from, I tell them it drops from &quot;the ogre boss in deadmines&quot;.<br /><br /><b>Cool stuff</b> You can /dance while on the mount, but not while it's moving.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is one of the items available as a reward to players of the <i>World of Warcraft</i> CCG/TCG (Collectable/Tradable Card Game).<br /><br />The cards that give you an item are:<br />1) <i>Landro Longshot</i>: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23705">Item: Tabard of Flame</a><br />2) <i>Thunderhead Hippogryph</i>: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23713">Item: Hippogryph Hatchling</a> (non-combat pet)<br />3) <i>Saltwater Snapjaw</i>: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23720">Item: Riding Turtle</a> (moves at your walking speed)<br /><br />To get the item, you need a copy of the card that no one has used yet. There is a scratch of area (like an instant lottery game), under this scratch off area is a code unique to that copy of that card, so each card's code can only be used once ever.<br /><br />There are three more items that are only available with &quot;UDE Points&quot;. Each booster pack comes with a code that can be used online to register 100 UDE points. Get enough points and you can spend them on UDE/WoW Items. The in-game items that will be available are:<br />1) An alternate blue tabard<br />2) A reusable trinket that sets off a unique fireworks display<br />3) A reusable trinket that changes your in-game appearance to an ogre<br /><br />Last, but not least, each of these items is specific to the single character you claim it for, not your whole account.<br /><br />More details at <a href="http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/news/article.aspx?aid=1243" rel="nofollow">Loot Cards and UDE Points FAQ</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got one of these, it is at walking speed, and the graphic is right about it being lvl 20. I think carrot, spurs, and glove riding chant will help, but mostly its just for showing off. Actually all it's for is showing off.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This mount moves at 100% speed, that is the normal speed <b>without</b>a mount!<br /><br />It does not increase you speed by 100%, it does 0% change to your speed. An epic mount increases by 100%, so you are travveling at 200%, and a normal mount increases by 60% so you are travelling at 160%. 100% = normal speed....<br /><br />And besides, it clearly says &quot;It may be slow, but it gets you off your feet!&quot; Why would it say that if it was travelling at epic mount speed! Note how an epic mount says &quot;This is a very fast mount.&quot; Since when did &quot;It may be slow, but it gets you off your feet!&quot; and &quot;This is a very fast mount.&quot; become one and teh same? Use your brains please....</div>
