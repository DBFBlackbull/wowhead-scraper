<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The droprate is higher than is says, because of it is so many that kills yetis, and only ppl that got the quest get the rod drop...thats why it says its so little droprate...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've done this quest three times: once on my rogue once on my shaman and once on my druid now.<br /><br />Rogue = Roughly 1 - 1 1/2 hours of yeti killing in the cave got me the rod<br /><br />Shaman = After preparing myself for a day of yeti killing, the first yeti I killed (not even gotten inside the cave yet) drops the rod for me<br /><br />Druid = This time, however, was not as lucky, and another 2 hour yeti killing fest netted me my rod.<br /><br />So.. Luck goes both ways. <br />Hint: Best way to do the quest is to grab a 5man that all need the rod and just mow through as many yeti as possible as fast as possible. Once the rod drops, everyone can loot it, so its all good.<br /><br />Enjoy =]</div>

Not sure how many I've killed, but the leather should be a good estimate. Good if you're within three levels and a skinner or miner - otherwise I wouldn't bother unless you really want to or think you will get the rod within a few kills like other people.<br /><br />~Xenchil<br />&lt;The Travelers&gt;<br />Sentinels &lt;RP&gt;<br />Level 35 Tauren Druid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've just been none stop killing the Cave and Ferocious Yeti's for 2 hours and 21minutes and was tempted to go straight to bed, so as I was on my way back up out of the cave I managed to get one before I exited which made my night lol, so I ended up finishing the quest after all but in a time-consuming p1$$ take :/<br /><br />Too low for my liking to be honest, quests like this kinda do my head in and beg for me to exit the game and not do the quests like that. The other quest similar to this was the Plainstrider beaks in the barrens for the Horde, the 7 beaks took a while to collect too.<br /><br />--Lee</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I killed about 70 yetis so far and still no rod : \</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>what a quest XD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DrexOzzy</b></h3>for wow classic can confirm its about a 1% chance to drop. spent about 1 1/2 hrs killing mountain yeti until the item dropped. unless u are really lucky with your rng prepare to spend about 1-2 hrs killing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Scccxs</b></h3>Got mine in the cavern (lower part of the cavern -&gt; passage -&gt; cave at the end - there). Mid-northern part of Hillsbrad Foothills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Geryth</b></h3>Doing this is a group is beneficial as I confirmed that it IS shared party loot and every party member can loot it when it finally drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WarriorWarrior</b></h3>Killed 7 Cave Yetis and then got the drop on my first Ferocious Yeti</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Demonjaktar</b></h3>As other people tells, the drop rate is really bad.<br />On the plus side, it drops for the whole party.<br />And with Anniversary Realm that's a good thing.<br /><br />Talk 'bout camp'o'rama</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tauridxx</b></h3>Did this a couple of months ago on my druid. 3 hours of grinding and it eventually dropped. Did it today on my warrior. Dropped on the 2nd Yeti...</div>
