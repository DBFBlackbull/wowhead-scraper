<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone was right, I spent about 30-45 minutes running around Durotar and got 80+ Copper Ore. Just check all the caves, and stay near the little&nbsp; hills and rock piles.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is loads of Copper Ores in South Loch Modan and Northeast where the orges are there is some copper ores aswell...there is also some tin ores</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>u can bassically find copper ores everywhere thats a lvl range of 1-20, but deadmines is a very good place to find copper also (and tin), i always go there when im trying to get my JC skill up</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>THE best place I think to mine Copper is Venture Co Mine in Mulgore, south sast of Thunder Bluff (entrance is at 60, 49). It has level 8-10 mobs and a lot of veins spawn like hell. Be sure to also go to the top and exit the mine: there's a little camp with two or three veins too. If you develop a standard route through the mine you can get a constant stream of copper ore because of veins respawning. Hmmm, nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>That guy talkin about Durotar ain't no joke.. i walked up n down from sen'jin to orgrimmar, got over 100 copper* in one trip. obviously horde, i suppose alliance could, but if so i'd suggest @ night when like no one is around durotar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Edited, Sun Jan 16 23:32:24 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>these sell quite good at the auction house, you can sell like 10 for 1g!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i sell 1g 70s per 10 stack in chromaggus... get rich quick man :D went from 5g to 20g in 1 day! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On dunemaul this sells for 1g a stack ;000</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>XinR</b></h3>In Mulgore, the earth elementals can be mined for copper.. it doesn't provide skill points but its easy ore. just keep killing, looting, then mining them.. same with the elementals outside Org that are fighting the water elementals.. kill, loot, mine.. again.. NO skill points but you get a copper ore each time.. easy kills, easy mining.. by the time you kill a few, they'll respawn. Spent about 5 minutes doing this in each spot (on diff toons) and had about 50 ore in no time..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maioranae</b></h3>I've found Elwynn Forest to be great for copper. Circle around all ridgelines and mountains. You can avoid most encounters that way and if no one else is mining come away with 80 ore. Little to no problem and Goldshire has both forge and trainer.</div>
