Buy it from the AH, don't farm this. The mobs don't even drop ANYthing of relevance, ecxcept maybe random world drops. At about 50 % they only drop gold.

Dual-wielders who choose to enchant both weapons can and often will get both weapons to proc, for an 800 (warrior) or 400 (rogue) attack power boost.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7187</b></h3>I had to farm for about 14 hours before I got this. It only drops off the spellbinders and they are only in the tower off the road, although you will occasionally find one walking down south away from the tower. Easily farmable with a mage, rogue or lock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7968</b></h3>An often farmed formula. Crusader is one of the few enchants that is actually worth it, and still cheap. Great for tanking as a warrior, and rogues when grinding.<br /><br />Most people grind for days and days. This formula has a 0.01% drop rate. Many people think that then if they kill 1k of these Spellbinder mobs (found @ 54,23 in WPL) they'll eventually get this (as it's not only a great enchant, it sells for a pretty penny too!) This is not true, as like with all drops, every mob is a 0.01% drop rate. So, dropping is PURE luck. Have fun ;)!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vargh</b></h3>Best enchant for a main hand weapon, as a Rogue Agility is nice on off-hand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8421</b></h3>I have grinded this so much. Spellbinders spawn 3 on bottom and 3 on top of the tower. Then there are about 2-4 that spawn along the road to the tower also. There may be Avengers, but just kill them and eventually Spellbinders will spawn there too. I grinded this place for about 12 hours once and it never dropped. I got one crummy blue that sold for like 60g =/ I went back another day and got it to drop in about 3 hours. Sold for about 450g. Now they sell for around 250-300g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8004</b></h3>as many people said, the spellbinders have an extremely low drop rate on this. some people prefer to just buy it off the ah, but i think farming this pattern is worth it. <br />also, investing money in this enchant will give great returns. i've seen people charging lots of gold + mats for this enchant.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8491</b></h3>The enchant itself is awesome. If you plan on farming for this... please use caution. There is usully always someone there. But from personal experience. Please be nice, if you see someone farming it right now. Just come back to the tower later and farm it. Alliance or Horde. If you see someone there, they have probably been there for a long time trying to get it. I know when Im farming it, its a pain having a rouge or somthing start attacking you. But usully when someone sees me farming it, they wave and go on, even if they are of the oposite faction. So if you see somene there, dont attack them, or even try to start farming it along side someone else thats not in your party, its just inpolite.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SeriusJones</b></h3>For an enchanter:<br /><br />I tried to farm for this, but on my server this place was overcamped and the spawns were fast and unreliable (lots of dying). I would recommend buying this on the Auction House rather than farm for it.<br /><br />For a farmer:<br /><br />Some place like Tyr's Hand may be reliable cash-wise... But if you have your heart set on finding this, kill the one type of mob that drops it (Scarlet Spellbinder). The best spawn for this is a small tower, at the top of this arrow shaped cluster of pinpoints on this map: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=4494">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=4494</a>. Good Luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stimps</b></h3>This enchant drops from Scarlet Spellbinders - level 57/58 non elites in WPL (link: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=4494">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=4494</a>)<br /><br />I've just had my third enchant drop from the spellbinders... after 1982 kills, which gives a drop rate of approximately 0.15%.<br /><br />The first 2 dropped relatively quickly (after a total of 500 kills or so) but it's taken a lot of farming for this latest one to show up.<br /><br />My only advice for farming this enchant is to make sure you have the tower to yourself; try to stagger your kills to avoid all 3 spellbinders respawning together; and to take out Durgen (top of the tower) as soon as you can, as he's a bit of a pain with his stuns.<br /><br />It's pretty straightforward to keep the spellbinders under control - they use frostbolts, slow, and a form of frost nova.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>qagmire</b></h3>I was just grinding in Tyr's Hand on my hunter, and this dropped off of a Scarlet Archmage.<br /><br />It looks like 2.0.3 added some new drop locations!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>26605</b></h3>The above coordinates are correct (54,23) for purposes of finding the Spellbinders; you may come across a couple on your way in, but this is where the vast majority are. Was able to acquire the recipe in about 2-3 hours given the poor spawn rate. Took 116 kills (about 0.8% rather than the 0.4% norm).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Phioner</b></h3>If you are going to grind this in TBC, I suggest you to head to EPL and to kill archmages in Tyr's hand. They are easily soloable if you are 70lvl, you resist a lot of their spells. I got mine from the 3rd archmage I killed. Good luck, it's worth to grind this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rmk1999</b></h3>i must have gotten very lucky with this...i'm reading all these comments about killing 1000's of mobs for it. I got it 3 days in a row all within the 4th clearing of the tower. Sold 115g each time. I gave up now that the tower has gotten crowded(nice world pvp though) and went to farming the mats for it. A righteous orb averages at 35g a piece on my realm...i've seen it jacked up and listed at 110g(which was nice cause listing mine at 75g looked like a good deal). Can't sell the actual enchant for the life of me, but the mats never stay on AH for more than an hour or so.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed this tonight in one session.&nbsp; The drop happened for me in about 2 hours, maybe that will give you some hope.&nbsp; I had a friend finishing Of love and family while I did it, so I took one short break to heal him.&nbsp; I was about to give up cause a rogue and another druid had just shown up to farm as well, but it dropped on one of the last spawns I got on my way down the tower.&nbsp; So happy!<br /><br />The spawns who drop this, the Scarlet Spellbinders, are non elite mage types level 56-58.&nbsp; Low health, but they can do some not insignificant damage against a lvl 60 if there are 3 of them.&nbsp; They use almost all frost spells, including frost bolt and frost nova.&nbsp; High frost resist and you will take almost no damage.&nbsp; Be prepared for the slowing and immobolizing effects.&nbsp; They will frost nova you and run to range, and then cast frost bolts.&nbsp; They die fairly quickly tho.&nbsp; In cat form it was taking about 10 hits to down one (assuming starting from stealth and behind, I am a feral druid, well equipped btw).&nbsp; <br /><br />There are three spawns at both the bottom and top of the tower.&nbsp; They aggro together when you attack, and all three were taking me down to about 20% health if I killed them without healing.&nbsp; There is also a spawn that circles the base of the tower, inside the wall, but not on the interior.&nbsp; There is one more spawn that spawns south on the road, and patrols up to the named scarlet hunter, and back down to a camp of scarlet mages.&nbsp; Other adds that you might see insider the tower are a named captain (not elite) who is melee with a 3 sec stun and has a bit of armor.&nbsp; He spawns faster then the spellbinders, and starts at the top of the tower, and patrols from there, down to the base, then out front, where he stops by each of the stationary tower guards, before going back to the top of the tower.&nbsp; There is also another Scarlet avenger who circles the base of the tower along the same root as the spellbinder.&nbsp; The avengers are fast melee (duel wielders) with some armor and no special attacks I saw.&nbsp; There are two guards in from of the tower who are also avengers, but you can avoid their aggro once inside the tower, if you are level 60.<br /><br />As said before, they do frost damage with movement impairing effects.&nbsp; After taking them down the first time at the base, then killing the named on the stairs, and then killing all three on top, I found if I waited for the repop, they could be killed one at a time as the respawned, limiting the damage taken by having the two in the background.&nbsp; Also, killing the named as soon as he popped help keep him from sneaking up on me.&nbsp; At about 15% health the spellbinders try to run, so be ready.&nbsp; This isn't too much of a problem on top of th tower, but at the base they can run out front and aggor the two guards.&nbsp; The avengers and named don't try to run. <br /><br />Going to Use the pattern, so I am very happy it dropped, saving me 300g (the current price on Kilrogg).&nbsp; If I do go back, and find another, I'll probably auction it for 50g, 150 Buyout, because I believe our server's price is a bit absurd...<br /><br />Happy hunting, hope this helps!</div>

No one cares how fast you got it or if you really did get it in 27kills or 500 kills its not gonna discourge most theyl try it anyways, most of you lie as well yes its possible but does it really matter? save your &quot;i got it after 10 kills&quot; cause no one cares not after about 100 other people saying somethin on the lines of that, that goes for all long awaited drops. just post the info, let a few give thier exp on how fast or long it takes to drop and leave it at that, its even a waste of time for me typing this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was a level 54 and was doing the quest that takes you to the top of the tower to loot a box for some chain quest. I went with my guild, I was in “The Holy Knights” at the time and we had a full party, we killed all the guards on the way up and random stuff dropped. People in the guild said that this was the only place that the crusader enchant dropped, it did not and no one was surprised. <br />The next day I was questing in the western plaguelands and someone ask me if I would help them with a quest, it was the same one that I had done the day before, so I said yeah I know where it is and I would help. We went to the tower killed all the guards got the quest item then started looting the bodies and a green formula came up in the window, it was the crusader enchant, I expressed greed, he expressed greed, I won. Then another formula came up in the window, it was the crusader enchant, I expressed greed, he expressed greed, I won. <br />My heart was beating so hard, I ask him if he had completed the quest? He said he had, I said “g2g good luck and have fun” and left. I don’t think he knew what the crusader enchant was. I announced the good news in guild chat and everyone expressed how lucky I was and “gratz”. A little while later I thought, what am I going to do with two of these, and what would be the right thing. So I looked back in chat and found the guy’s name that I was questing with, whispered him and told him that we had found two&nbsp; very high level enchanting formulas and that I was going to send him one and “don’t sell it cheap”.<br />&nbsp; The enchanter in our guild that I run instances with just made 300 and I still had it in the bank, so I gave him the other copy. <br /><br />I think I am too nice for this game.</div>

On the top floor, instead of going up the stairs, select the spellbinder directly above you when you're at the final set of steps to the top. Just jump and you can hit the spellbinder and it will come by itself. Then you're just left with the other 2, easy =)<br />hope that helps<br /><br />Edited, Sat May 6 15:16:27 2006</div>

I kept my cool, stuck it out, did my best to snag the npcs as fast as I could and out of all of the farming. I got this enchant, but I also did get an orb of deception, a few greens and loads of runecloth. So glad I picked up tailoring, so I'm set on mats to d/e :D.<br /><br />GL out there to those farming, don't give up and just keep at it. I've also killed the lv 63 elite rare Scarlet High Clerist 3 times (sadly no epic dagger drop). I got what I needed and don't want to return here unless I'm given a quest to return.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Armak</b></h3>Another example of low-droprate craziness. 0.5 % (recently went down to 0.4) - which means one drop in every 200 kills on average. A friend of mine had two drops in his first 80 kills, 5-8 drops in a total of ~350 kills. <i>Easy money</i>, Mr Armak thought. Months later I'm still slaughtering those Spellbinders at 1233 kills (!). My personal chance of not having seen at least one formula is 0.206946726 %.<br />Let's see how small I can make this number. I've spent a total of ~ 40 hours farming. Including sharing the tower with another person, including fighting annoying <s>!@#$%^&amp;s</s> hunters of the same faction coming by and aggressively taking all mobs, including arriving and instantly leaving (closed due to overcrowding) and including fighting the alliance which is a bad idea being a tank warrior and being in a tower with stairs - easy job for casters.<br />All in all: Not very good for chasing those 300 g on the auction house. I hope for overcompensation after my first drop (if it ever occurs). 12 drops in the next 100 kills and I'm okay with it.<br /><br />Pro tip: Give it a try only once. Do 50 kills. No drop? Buy it from the AH, don't farm this. The mobs don't even drop ANYthing of relevance, ecxcept maybe random world drops. At about 50 % they only drop gold. My best loot was one of those darkmoon cards, 50 g. And occasionally a major mana potion. A complete waste of time - but I can't stop now.<br /><br />Edit: Secretly, I only complained here to force the drop. And after 1285 kills it dropped! After that I roughly did 200 more kills- the second drop is yet to come :/</div>
