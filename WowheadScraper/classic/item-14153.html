Then on top of that, the materials for this pattern will add up to 200g, where just running MC will get you better equipment.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7791</b></h3>This WAS the best warlock robe in the game back before we could see all this BC gear, it was definately worth it, now I would just say to wait till BC and make something almost as good for a much lesser cost.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>That doesn't change that fact that Robe of the Void is crap next to the Mage/Priest epic tailor robes. It needs a buff, badly. The heal pet aspect of it is a complete joke. Put something useful for the second effect like life regen or reduced cooldown on Shadowburn. Hell, I don't know just something that would be at least somewhat useful and comparable to the Mage/Priest robes. <br /><br />Mage gets:<br />Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 40. <br />Equip: Improves your chance to get a critical strike with spells by 1%. <br />Use: Restores 375 to 625 mana. <br /><br />Priest gets:<br />Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 73. <br />Equip: Restores 6 mana every 5 sec. <br />Equip: Reduces the cooldown of your Fade ability by 2 sec. <br /><br />Warlock gets:<br />Equip: Increases damage done by Shadow spells and effects by up to 49. <br />Use: Heal your pet for 300 to 500. <br /><br />Tell me the Warlock item isn't by far the worst of the 3.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My own experimentation has shown me not to underestimate other people's builds just because they are non-standard.&nbsp; For example, I consistently out-DPG every flavor of Ruin-lock I have ever played with, while I dont have Ruin myself.&nbsp; This is anywhere from Sunken Temple to knocking on Ragnaros's door in MC.&nbsp; I too, prefer to solo with the succubus.&nbsp; A voidwalker can't hold aggro on my DMG anyway, and I find I mow through mobs quicker with my succubus with practically non-existant downtime.&nbsp; I also find a Succubus far better to have at hand should I get jumped by random players.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;Typical&quot; and &quot;Common&quot; does not always mean &quot;Most Effective.&quot;&nbsp; If anything, it leans more to &quot;mindless sheep.&quot;&nbsp; I've seen so many typical warlocks soloing with void.. taking out mobs (which looks to me like a crawl)... and all the opposing faction void-soloing-locks I happen to see I just eat like candy... Every one of them...&nbsp; I used to be one of those candies here and there when I was an inexperienced lowbie, and I don't miss those days in the least.<br /><br />Juggalo's build does seem a bit odd in that he skipped over Demonology skills that many locks consider to be &quot;must-haves&quot; like DemonicEmbrace, FelDomination, and MasterSummoner.&nbsp; In the Destruction tree, I actually consider Bane a &quot;must-have&quot; myself while many locks overlook it completely.&nbsp; I guess they think &quot;half a second?&nbsp; what crap...&quot;&nbsp; but if you do the math you can cast shadowbolts 20% faster (like a 20% DPS-boost) and you can crank out Immolates 33% faster.<br /><br />And yes, the pet-heal is total crap.&nbsp; From what I can remember (I use it so rarely) it has a 10-minute cooldown, and it heals barely any life at all.&nbsp; I only use it as a random perk if I notice my pet is a little down, but it does save my pet on very rare occasion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tanking with Succubus and soloing with Succubus aren't the same thing. Soloing with Succubus is very useful at times but when you solo with a Succubus YOU are the one that tanks. His argument was:<br /><br />&quot;Heal pet= Best Lock skill soloing (especially because all the added succubus abilities) &quot; <br /><br />My point was, when having a Succubus out you want to make sure you take the damage and it doesn't get aggro(be it solo or group) because it dies very fast and that little tiny bit of health isn't gonna save it if most things at that level want it dead. Now maybe if it was needed to offtank an add or something soloing then that might be slightly useful but it isn't gonna be of any help 99.9% of the time. And it is FAR from the &quot;Best Lock skill soloing&quot;.<br /><br />And I'm well aware that Walocks have no standard build and very different Warlocks can be just as good as each other. I just think the build he posted was nothing to brag about(which it isn't) and since he seemed to think that his build was the best Warlock build ever, I felt like pointing out that it wasn't.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In the destruction tree, you pretty much picked all my favorite skills: they all get down to business and just hurt people =P.&nbsp; I've never tried out improved lash of pain myself, but the only thing I could conceive replacing it with is Intensity.&nbsp; I have mixed feelings about Intensity anyways; cause warlocks shouldn't get aggro when grouped with mages, and PvP-opponents will usually just stun-interrupt somehow.&nbsp; I guess its OK for 5-mans where your group expects you to be their only AoE.&nbsp; I kind-of-like Improved firebolt when I'm impin' because the Imp pumps out Dmg twice as fast (but also ends up just sitting and staring in half the time because he's out of mana).<br /><br />In affliction, the Improved CoA only amounts to 60-90 extra dmg, but it takes 30seconds for that dmg to be realized, so most locks don't consider it a worthy talent.&nbsp; I also started out with Improved Drain Soul, but after I ditched it I didn't really &quot;feel&quot; the difference (You may have different experiences, and I was a noob then so I can't be sure =P).&nbsp; Also, a lot of warlocks consider CoEx and ImpCoEx to be a waste of talent points.&nbsp; In my experience, this spell is only &quot;OK&quot; at giving distance between rogues and warriors (have to work on staying just inside warrior intercept range) and its semi-useful on the battlegrounds, but I've found it most excellent at chasing down runners.&nbsp; And yes I too have &quot;wasted&quot; points in this talent because I am a malicious bastard that can't stand to let my enemies get away =P.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you plan on soloing with succubus and&nbsp; tanking yourself, then being able to DrainLife/DrainSoul with Fel-Concentration helps.&nbsp; &nbsp; FelCon also makes nightfall more useful since you can hold drain-life better.&nbsp; I myself even Drain-Life players into the ground frequently, but this takes ALOT of +Shdw/Magic Dmg to pull off.&nbsp; (Can be hard to win a DMG-race with a +DMG lock when he's got you triple DoTed and stealing your life, not to mention intermittant Shadow-burns and&nbsp; Nightfall Procs)<br /><br />Whenever I look at talents and think &quot;Why the hell did Bliz put this here?&quot;&nbsp; I wonder if it's just something I don't understand yet.&nbsp; So you may have different experiences than this, and if you do it's cool to hear about it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a great robe as a &quot;Damage Set&quot;.&nbsp; Of course you should have a 2nd &quot;instance/farming&quot; set of gear.&nbsp; PvP wise, this is the most + Shadow you're gonna get on a robe, don't worry about the STA only on it, as our HP = mana anyway.<br /><br />The heal pet ability isnt very useful, but better than nothing i guess.<br /><br />I got my essence of fire from our guild (bank), bought the esssence of&nbsp; undeath, and farmed the rest. Runecloth is easy. <br /><br />Now the felcloth/demonic runes are probably the biggest pain in the ass.&nbsp; I farmed all mine in Felwood, alternating from the area south of Jadeanar (sp?) and the NW area (where you'll have to conquer some alliance in most cases).&nbsp; The NW area seems to drop the runes more often, but the South area seems to drop more felcloth.&nbsp; Perhaps just coincidence, but after farming this for 5 hours over a couple days, this is what i saw.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, this item is a must-have. <br /><br />Once I hit 57, I spent a whole day farming the runes in the area south of Jaedenar (It's called the Ruins of Constellas but I call it &quot;the Jadefire Moonwell&quot; for obvious reasons). During that time I also collected about 13 Felcloth, 5 assorted greens, a world epic (Taran Icebreaker=<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8847/tome-of-scorch-v">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8847/tome-of-scorch-v</a>), and five or six stacks of Mageweave. I admit that the drop rate for the Runes is low, but that is also a good thing; from start to finish, about 10 bars of XP was gained from the whole ordeal.<br /><br />This is coming from someone who hasn't even smelled Scholo yet, let alone ran through it. You could also up the damage a bit more by making a Felcloth Hood (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17881">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17881</a>), Felcloth Shoulders (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17746/noxxions-shackles">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17746/noxxions-shackles</a>), Felcloth Pants (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8131/myrmidons-helm">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8131/myrmidons-helm</a>) and Felcloth Gloves (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=36324">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=36324</a>). On top of that, if you did that lvl 50 quest, you should have Soul Harvester (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52032">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52032</a>) in your hands. 111+ from the Felcloth stuff, 24+ from the Soul Harvester, and 49+ from the RotV. That's 184+ damage on shadow spells, plus the luxury of looking bad-ass.<br /><br />Kinda nice without having to drudge through Scholo or UD strat countless times, eh?<br /><br />Since these items is directed towards warlocks, especially Destruction-based ones, they can see the outcome of that. I don't expect a mage to understand any of this. (Why did the Priest/Mage stuff get put in here anyway? And why should we care that they don't like us?)<br /><br />So, until you find yourself a nice epic set (like the one being released in 1.9), try out the stuff you can make yourself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I noticed someone asking who on a server could make these.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if you want to get them, you have to be a 300 tailor yourself, these robes are BoP.&nbsp; So get sewing locks!&nbsp; Get in touch with your feminine side : )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Currently I wear the Robe of the Void.&nbsp; However, it probably isn't going to be too long until I have the opportunity to acquire felheart robes as well.&nbsp; But which is better to wear? I currently focus on +dmg so I love this robe, but the stamina and +hit on felheart is awesome too.&nbsp; Which is better? I just can't decide whether or not to spend DKP on felheart robes.&nbsp; Is it worth it to replace robe of the void with the felheart robes?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just a rehash of the things you need to know in order to acquire this robe:<br /><br />Firstly, only YOU can make it.&nbsp; It is BoP so YOU must be a 300 tailor to make this robe, it cannot be purchased.<br /><br />The pattern can be purchased from AH, usually for around 20 gold.<br /><br />If you are planning to make this robe and are not a tailor and don't want to spend a lot of gold; start stockpiling linen, wool, silk, mageweave, and runecloth.&nbsp; Make a banker alt to send it to.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would recommend having 300 linen/wool, 500 silk, 600 mageweave, and 700-800 runecloth saved up before switching one of your professions to tailoring.<br /><br />The satyr camps in Azshara are IMO the best place to farm demonic runes and felcloth.&nbsp; Felwood is good, but typically you'll have more compition there.<br /><br />I stockpiled (almost) everything I needed before I switched from herbalism to tailoring in order to make this.&nbsp; It took me about 8 hours to get to 300 because I ran short on silk/mageweave/runecloth.&nbsp; In total I probably spent 60g and it took me about a week to farm up the mats (to get to 300 and make the robe.)<br /><br />This robe was well worth the time.&nbsp; It's better than anything you're going to get outside of a 20-40 man raid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>assuming you didn't have anyone hook you up with the mats... this was a major pain to farm, especially in a pvp environment... well over 8 hours worth of farming... maybe over 10 :-\<br /><br />essence of fire i would average about 2 every hour or two<br /><br />felcloth drops are sporadic... sometimes i'll get 5 in an hour, another hour i'll get 1 or 2.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Best place to farm demonic runes is Felwood jadefire mobs.<br /><br />Jadefire Betrayer (47 - 53) 4.86%<br />Jadefire Hellcaller (48 - 54) 5.83%<br />Jadefire Satyr (46 - 50) 2.88%<br />Jadefire Trickster (47 - 53) 4.82%<br /><br />Can be found north in Felwood, loc 42.17</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This robe does infact rock.&nbsp; I am kind of low on the list for any robes in my guild for the MC runs so I made 2 of these robes just to have a back up for when&nbsp; the other one breaks from wipes or so.&nbsp; Call me Crazy but it's too funny to bust out a second robe of the void.&nbsp; Btw Azshara is by far quicker for farming demonic runes and felcloth, i averaged about 10/hour on felcloth and 1/13 kills on the demonic runes.&nbsp; That + runecloth + travelers backpacks and random greens in the chest + loads of honor for killing all the allies.&nbsp; It was fun to make 2 of these things.&nbsp; Essences i just AH'd half the Essence Fires, farmed the other half in Un goro and I got the Essence of Undeaths really easy in scholo and in epl/wpl.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As BC has come that robe seems to be crap one, the green robes at lvl 62+ are better. Am I right?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, if you ask me, these are still great for a lock. The robes have a pretty high +dmg for the level. Yes, the Outlands !@#$ have higher +stam and possibly +int on them, but you really shouldn't forget about the pet heal ability.<br /><br />As low as it seems, it has a chance to crit, thus making it possible to sometimes heal your pet for about 1,5k. Still doesn't seem much? Well, maybe so, if you are doing it with a voidwalker. But if you are demonology specced and you are using the felguard, you'll see the difference. Because felguard holds aggro way better than the void, but also takes more dmg. If your fel dies, the mob turns to you and the fight becomes longer or you possibly die. But if you cobine heal ability from the robes and a little health funnel every now and then, your pet is almoast immortal - and so are you. Almoast:))<br /><br />So, i'd say, if you are demonology specced (or plan to be), go for it. The mats are not too expensive and the pattern drops regularly, so . . . I wish only Blizz would change the graphics on them:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if a priest tailorer rolls on this then he is a ninja, simply because the robe is BoP and cannot be used by a priest, only warlock. there is nothing any other tailorer except warlock could do with this pattern except sell it. if he uses the pattern, then he just wasted however much its worth because he cant sell BoP in AH. If you have this, and you are not a warlock, you should sell it in the AH, because you can't wear the robe, and you shouldn't even be asking the question. READ.<br />Robe of the Void <br />--&gt;Binds when picked up&lt;--<br />Chest(Robe) Cloth <br />says it at the top of the page, meaning you CANT sell it, except to a vendor, and if you arent a warlock, you cant wear it.<br />-&gt;Classes: Warlock&lt;-<br />sad that i had to copy and paste from right at the top of the page but there are like dozen clueless posts on here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Robe of the Void is a simple item to make. All materials can be bough on AH except Demonic Runes.<br /><br />Components: Tailoring: 12x Bolt of Runecloth, 20x Demonic Rune, 40x Felcloth, 12x Essence of Fire, 12x Essence of Undeath, 2x Rune Thread<br /><br />12x Bolt of Runecloth = 60 runecloth. Simply 2, maybe 3 scholo runs.<br /><br />20x Demonic Rune = Jadefire Run, Felwood. Took me an uncomfortable 4 hours to grind all these runes.<br /><br />40x Felcloth - Jadefire Run, Felwood. I got 43 felcloth while I was grinding runes. No problems there.<br /><br />12x Essence of Fire - Auction House, Un'Goro Crater or BRD. Its alot of essence of fire, cost me 6g each on Bronzebeard server.<br /><br />12x Essence of Undeath - Scholo runs again. Easy to get, usually sell for 2g on Bronzebeard.<br /><br />Mine was a grand total of 72g. Good luck getting your Robes of the Void guys. Fairly simple to get considering how good they are =D<br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 26th 2006 at 11:50am EDT by HellequinBB</i></div>

Like 2 to 3 times as much. I just got the robe from PvP, from rank 8, and not even sure this is worth making any more after looking at how much more this will cost to make, even besides the cost of getting to 300 tailoring.<br /><br />Ah well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Way better than I first thought. Stats are as good as Zandalar and Felheart for most situations, and the pet heal is more useful than it looks. I've passed on both the PH Kossak and FH Robes because I had this, though that's partly because we actually like each other in my guild.<br /><br />It's no Archmage, but nothing new there. Mage gear is generally better than ours, but that's probably to make up for the fact that we're the better class. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farmed most of mats, bought a few. Robes rocks with new pet (doomguard). Put +3 all stats enchant on it, as I figure 30 hp, 30 mp, and the other benies are much better than just a +100 heath or mana. Will be upgrading to +4 all stats when I find the recipe. As to the healing pet, havent had cause to use it yet :).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Compared with the robe of Archmage this just suxxx.<br />I wonder who's the genius that put that USE on this epic(?) robe. <br /><br />Archmage robe has 2 passive :<br /><br />+40 dmg and heling from spells (much better than +49 shadow)<br /><br />+1% chance to crit -_-<br /><br />Passive : restores up to 625 mana (heals your pet from 300 to 500? SAD)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I thought this robe sucked at first...<br /><br />14 stam? That's IT!<br /><br />But then I tested how much more shadow damge it does. Trust me, it's better than most people think. For crying out loud, your corruption, curse of agony, siphon life, drain life, and shadow bolt are all effected by this robe. Now I heal about 10 more health a second and do 30 more damage every tick in every battle. Not only that but my succubus is protected by the healing effect.<br /><br />Although, for an epic item, it should give more stats. I'd say 25 stamina and 10 intellect would be perfect.<br /><br />The thing that bothers me the most about this robe is its graphic. The color scheme is good but there are at least TWO OTHER ROBES that look EXACTLY the same that I've seen on level 50+ players. That's just RETARDED and needs to change... now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><b>If you are not a warlock</b>, quit looking at this item. Not only can you not use it, but since it's BOP, you can't sell 'em to anyone. Making the pattern and the item pretty much useless to non-warlocks.<br /><br />(Well, that's not true; if you get this pattern, go to the nearest auction house and announce what you're putting up to the town. However, be wary about the demand; not every warlock has tailoring, and those with it may not have the biggest cash-flow for this pattern.)<br /><br />If you are a warlock, the stats this thing gives you are far better than the Robes of Winternight. The extra +9 Shadow damage doesn't seem much, but as others have noted, multiply it by all the Shadow-based damaging effects you can churn out (and DoT on some of them, no less).<br /><br />The pet-healing ability might come in more useful in situations where you need to keep aggro on the pet for just another moment or so. Or, if used in conjunction with Health Funnel to keep your demon healthy and whole.<br /><br />Personally, I like the look; if others happen to look like me through other items, feh, small price to pay for looking as nifty as I'd feel. I plan on working for this pattern soon as I can get to it.</div>
