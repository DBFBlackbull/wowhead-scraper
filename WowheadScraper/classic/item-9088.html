Is it worth it to sell? Not really. Most casters will not see a benefit from this, unless they come under heavy fire of melee. \n\nMain tanks in raid situations however... that's a different story.\nFor example, a raid is killing a Corehound off in Molten Core. Ya, we all know.. Molten Core is nothing now. However, here's the example.\n\nAncient Core Hound hits MT, gets affected by the pot.\nLet's say for example, one strike, each melee hits for roughly 200. Let's say you have 12 melee total (Including tanks) You have 20 casters (mages, warlocks, balance druids whatever) Let's say they also hit for 200. Now, it's almost impossible for all these 32 people to attack at the same time, but just for sake of this example, we say they live in a Utopia, and did.\n\n32 people hitting at 200 damage each. Add +8 damage to each person. What is that 256? 256 extra damage done to that one mob with one strike. That damage, gets added onto anything. Factoring in special attacks, Hemo rogues (like myself), Curse of Shadow, Curse of Elements, any small additions adding to damage, you see a rather large change in pace of dps. The littlest things count. Something as simple as this pot, it does have it's uses.\n\nBut again, repeating...\nThis potion will be a waste to casters if they aren't getting hit, and yes... agreed with many below, the increase in damage is rather minimal, and unnoticeable by most.\n\nAgain, my two cents. \n\n-Ganta, 60 rogue, Maelstrom Server.","date":"2007-01-12T18:37:48-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Namapuos","importedSubject":"It's decent for what it is."},{"commentv2":1,"number":28,"id":3029605,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Sure, for soloing pruposes this potion is not that great.

I plan on giving them to my tanks (I'm a priest) in future instances when things start getting harder.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This potion processes very often, but in regards to the earlier comments, I suggest you making 1 at a time (meaning, don't leave extras in your bags) then using it cause the bug is frustrating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As I'm posting this, the bug with disappearing potions in the inventory has been fixed.<br /><br />If this potion is used in combination with the rogue DoT skills and/or hemorrhage, mobs will rot away in a bad manner.<br /><br />Edit: The recepe can be acquired from AH quite easy. On my server it sells as low as 40s buy-out, every time I check at least a dozen is being offered. Getting the herb Arthas' Tears is far more difficult: until you can safely walk Felwood you don't have access to it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has anyone tried using this in PvP? Will the Disease spread through groups like some others do?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1.5 speed dagger = 5.3DPS = 37.3 Strength = 74.6 attack power.<br />2.0 speed = 4DPS = 28 Strength = 56 attack power.<br />2.5 speed = 3.2DPS = 22.4 Strength = 45 attack power.<br />3.0 speed = 2.66DPS = 18.66 Strength = 37.3 attack power.<br />4.0 speed = 2DPS = 14 Strength = 28 attack power.<br /><br />Just so you know, 1 handed weapons gain 1DPS about every 1 - 1.5 levels. 2-Handed weapons gain 1DPS about every level. <br /><br />This potion can add about 2-6 levels worth of damage on to your weapon(s) (from slow to fast). For those of you that know how good it is to get a new weapon, even if it's only +2DPS, it's actually a significant boost. I guarantee you that these potions will pay for themselves.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I use it on boss like lucy and other bosses where rogues can deal dmg - you can argue if its good or not, since it takes up a debuff slot, but i like the extra dmg boost your offering your raid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a high level Alchemist and I gave a Gift of Arthas to a warrior tank to drink in our group when we were doing ZF. I also gave him a Elixir of Giants for more DPS ontop of all the warrior buffs he had.<br /><br />Every mob that hit him was inflicted with the Arthas diesease. He literally sliced through the elites like they were normal mobs. The bosses died quick too.<br /><br />I really cant tell you how good this potion is for tanks. It only lasts 30 mins but you will kill anything much faster once they have the diesease (which lasts on them for only 3 minutes - but I guarantee they wont even last 20 seconds once inflicted and you start hitting them)<br /><br />Best effects are when you give your tank this potion (Gift of Arthas) and also a Elixir of Giants and a Mighty/Great Rage potion. <br /><br />After he's drunk them, sit back and enjoy the show.<br /><br />Arthas Tears is the rare super herb used in this concotion and its hard to find.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does this stack with Hemmorhage or not? I havne't figured it out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Gift of Arthas potion isn't that bad if you are soloing. I'm a 60 Hemo specced rogue. Although the +8 to damage is barely noticeable, most can be said by my main attack. Hemmorhage. With +8 damage from the potion, and +7 from my talent, I'm hitting harder at +15 extra damage. To answer people's questions. Does it stack w/ Hemmorhage? Yes. It does indeed stack. Is it worth it to sell? Not really. Most casters will not see a benefit from this, unless they come under heavy fire of melee. <br /><br />Main tanks in raid situations however... that's a different story.<br />For example, a raid is killing a Corehound off in Molten Core. Ya, we all know.. Molten Core is nothing now. However, here's the example.<br /><br />Ancient Core Hound hits MT, gets affected by the pot.<br />Let's say for example, one strike, each melee hits for roughly 200. Let's say you have 12 melee total (Including tanks) You have 20 casters (mages, warlocks, balance druids whatever) Let's say they also hit for 200. Now, it's almost impossible for all these 32 people to attack at the same time, but just for sake of this example, we say they live in a Utopia, and did.<br /><br />32 people hitting at 200 damage each. Add +8 damage to each person. What is that 256? 256 extra damage done to that one mob with one strike. That damage, gets added onto anything. Factoring in special attacks, Hemo rogues (like myself), Curse of Shadow, Curse of Elements, any small additions adding to damage, you see a rather large change in pace of dps. The littlest things count. Something as simple as this pot, it does have it's uses.<br /><br />But again, repeating...<br />This potion will be a waste to casters if they aren't getting hit, and yes... agreed with many below, the increase in damage is rather minimal, and unnoticeable by most.<br /><br />Again, my two cents. <br /><br />-Ganta, 60 rogue, Maelstrom Server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sure, for soloing pruposes this potion is not that great. But think about it, people spend tons of money on +dmg enchants, scopes etc. In a 40man raid when the maintank has this it means that everyone who deals physical damage gets that +8 bonus, and thats just invaluable. It adds up to a *lot* of extra dps. Better yet, it works on most bosses in the game, try and see. The more then fair price is just a bonus.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm MT, and I don't fight a boss without it, unless I know we can easily take it down. Best of all, it stacks with Haemmorage (sp), so you can get a lot of extra damage on the mob.</div>
