Well @#$% me...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well..I had saved some of these on an ALT (when they were not BOP) and was doing a bit of cleaning..and now they are soul bound and since they are on a lev 1 bank alt I have no use for them.&nbsp; I have a ticket in to a GM about it.&nbsp; Don't know what will happen.<br /><br />PERHAPS, they made them BoP so ppl actually have to work for them and not buy them and that they will be worth something in the future for rep.&nbsp; But they changed the BOE BOP status now so that ppl don't get suspicious and save up.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />I guess after looking at this a bit further and a GM could tell me NOTHING!.. it appears this rep group (think it was called Wildhammer Clan) is now gone.&nbsp; So these items are for a one time only quest thus making them probably only drop if you have the quest and making them soulbound :(<br /><br />At least I can just dump these for more bank space now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this item is needed to lvl up your reputation with Wildhummer Clan</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I could have swore, I had a quest at mid 40s where i collect these for horde, But i abandoned it because Arathi is nuts. Now I just ran a couple quests there as a 60 and I have a ton of necklaces but can't find any info for horde nor remember where I got the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have not been able to find any benefit of gaining rep. with the Wildhammer clan. If you know of any please post.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>%^&amp;*ing allie quest! :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, basically, (if your not 70 yet this may be a spoiler) the Wildhammer clan are actually in a level 70 area of the outlands called Shadowmoon Valley, and you get rep off them there, so blizzard basically deleted all the rep of all players who had done the quests prior to TBC, and made it so you only get rep with them at 70. The reason for doing so is because the wild hammer clan are the vendors for your Epic and Normal Flying mounts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>who in earth is wildhammer Clan?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>erdiko</b></h3>For those playing classic, saving them up like me, I can confirm these are worthless- just like people said 13 years ago, haha.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kysumu</b></h3>As of this post, Fraggar Thundermantle does allow you to hand in the necklaces on a repeat quest basis in Classic. However, before you get too excited, he only gave me 2 wildhammer clan rep and 40xp on the first hand in but them gave me 3 rep on the second. Maybe it increases each time you hand in. I only had 10 necklaces and couldn't be bothered to farm any more so can't be certain. As you can get 5 rep just by killing the trolls this seems a poor reward in comparison to how many trolls you have to kill to get 5 necklaces to drop.<br /><br />Update: So I went back and farmed some more trolls for Wildhammer Rep and got another bunch of these. Hand in appeared to be random between 2 rep and 3 rep. I can hardly contain my excitement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gangplank</b></h3>Phase 3 SOD this gives 25 rep per turn in past the initial quest (5 required). It gives zero exp for the repeatable quest turn in, just the 25 rep each. I only went to friendly with it I do not know if it has diminishing rewards as you increase your standing.</div>
