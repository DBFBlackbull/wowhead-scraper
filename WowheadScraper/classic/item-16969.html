Didn't get coords but it's literally like a 15 second walk from the entrance to the camp.\n\nTaurinus, lvl 35 Druid","date":"2006-06-11T00:00:36-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"jdmckinnon","importedSubject":"For hordies"},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":2634860,"nreplies":5,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"For those of you who don't use Coords, here's a simple way to do this quest:\n\nFirst you should know that to get this quest the minimum requirements is to be level 35 and at a fishing skill of 225.\n\nSecond after you are 35 with skill 225 all you have to do is go to Nat Pagle in Dustwallow marsh, hes on a small island west of Theramore Isle.\n\nThird all you need to do to catch these fish is have the name of where they mention in the quest above your minimap, anywhere inside that area is fine to catch them.\n\nNow for the quest:\n\nSavage Coast Blue Sailfin - This fish needs to be caught in Stranglethorn Vale. Now there are two places one is called SOUTHERN Savage Coast, and the other is just Savage Coast, you must be at Savage Coast to catch this fish and that is near the Grom'gol base camp (which is horde Ugh. lol) After you catch that fish Run up to darkshire and follow the road that takes you east out of town and head east through Deadwind Pass following the road to Swamp of Sorrows.\n\nMisty Reed Mahi Mahi - This one is in Swamp of Sorrows (which is East of Darkshire). It's at the very south eastern most part of the zone past the Sunken Temple of Attal'Hakkar and threw some lvl 45+ dragonkin. Now when you get all the way over here i went out into the water at the South West part and there are three islands, one of which you still stay in the Misty Reed and can fish off of without Murlocs trying to pester you. The other two islands however are just barely out of the area so make sure you are still in Misty Reed or you'll never see that fish. From here you can either die and spirit res at Graveyard near stoneard or walk here then walk south into Blasted lands where alliance can fly from Nethergarde Keep (Northeast part of map) up to Menethil harbor to venture to the other continent. Take the boat over to Theramore Isle, Dustwallow Marsh, then fly to Desolace.\n\nSar'theris Striker - This fish is in Desolace near another horde town called Shadowprey village and it's pretty far south near the zone to Feralas and west of the Gelkis clan over on that coast. After you catch this fish back track a lil past Gelkis clan area and follow the road that takes you South into Feralas.\n\nFeralas Ahi - there's a Horde town (lol horde must really like fishing or something) in the middle of Feralas which has a river running along side of it, thats Verdantis River and since i'm Alliance i just went a little way downstream and caught it.\n\nAfter you've done all that head to whichever Flight path you think is closest there is one to the east of you and to the west of you in Feralas, I went to Feathermoon Stronghold and flew back to Dustwallow Marsh, Where i went and saw Nat Pagle and completed the quest. Now i can sit back and fish all the way to 300.\n\nWell i hope this guide helped. And good luck fishing!\n\nThis was posted by Quicklet: 39 Night Elf, Hunter of Burning Blade.","date":"2006-07-17T12:00:36-05:00","rating":77,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Caught the fish in Southern Savage Coast.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>27,21. took about 10-15 casts. No biggie. Just be patient.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I caught this just &quot;yards&quot; from the Grom Gol Base Camp. At first I was trying coords I got from Thottbot but most were upriver a bit and I kept getting bothered by bonehead allys. Since the Sailfin seems to be common all along the coast up toward Duskwood, I decided to start closer to safe turf. Caught the fish after only a few casts on the little tiny islet just southwest of Grom Gol. Didn't get coords but it's literally like a 15 second walk from the entrance to the camp.<br /><br />Taurinus, lvl 35 Druid</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those of you who don't use Coords, here's a simple way to do this quest:<br /><br />First you should know that to get this quest the minimum requirements is to be level 35 and at a fishing skill of 225.<br /><br />Second after you are 35 with skill 225 all you have to do is go to Nat Pagle in Dustwallow marsh, hes on a small island west of Theramore Isle.<br /><br />Third all you need to do to catch these fish is have the name of where they mention in the quest above your minimap, anywhere inside that area is fine to catch them.<br /><br />Now for the quest:<br /><br />Savage Coast Blue Sailfin - This fish needs to be caught in Stranglethorn Vale. Now there are two places one is called SOUTHERN Savage Coast, and the other is just Savage Coast, you must be at Savage Coast to catch this fish and that is near the Grom'gol base camp (which is horde Ugh. lol) After you catch that fish Run up to darkshire and follow the road that takes you east out of town and head east through Deadwind Pass following the road to Swamp of Sorrows.<br /><br />Misty Reed Mahi Mahi - This one is in Swamp of Sorrows (which is East of Darkshire). It's at the very south eastern most part of the zone past the Sunken Temple of Attal'Hakkar and threw some lvl 45+ dragonkin. Now when you get all the way over here i went out into the water at the South West part and there are three islands, one of which you still stay in the Misty Reed and can fish off of without Murlocs trying to pester you. The other two islands however are just barely out of the area so make sure you are still in Misty Reed or you'll never see that fish. From here you can either die and spirit res at Graveyard near stoneard or walk here then walk south into Blasted lands where alliance can fly from Nethergarde Keep (Northeast part of map) up to Menethil harbor to venture to the other continent. Take the boat over to Theramore Isle, Dustwallow Marsh, then fly to Desolace.<br /><br />Sar'theris Striker - This fish is in Desolace near another horde town called Shadowprey village and it's pretty far south near the zone to Feralas and west of the Gelkis clan over on that coast. After you catch this fish back track a lil past Gelkis clan area and follow the road that takes you South into Feralas.<br /><br />Feralas Ahi - there's a Horde town (lol horde must really like fishing or something) in the middle of Feralas which has a river running along side of it, thats Verdantis River and since i'm Alliance i just went a little way downstream and caught it.<br /><br />After you've done all that head to whichever Flight path you think is closest there is one to the east of you and to the west of you in Feralas, I went to Feathermoon Stronghold and flew back to Dustwallow Marsh, Where i went and saw Nat Pagle and completed the quest. Now i can sit back and fish all the way to 300.<br /><br />Well i hope this guide helped. And good luck fishing!<br /><br />This was posted by Quicklet: 39 Night Elf, Hunter of Burning Blade.</div>

My 'toon was standing in chest high water (undeads are short so that would probably be waist deep for a Night Elf) and I was using Nat Pagler's fancy fishing pole (Hinterlands quest reward) with no lures.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Same as the rest, first cast at 29,25 in STV, which is just north of Grom'Gol Base Camp. Honestly you shouldn't have to go anywhere else as the name of the fish is 'Savage Coast Blue Sailfin' not 'Bloodsail Compound Blue Sailfin', etc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>after fishing outside grom, including north of it and south of it, and catching dozens of fish over a period of an hour, with NO sailfin, i tried outside BB, and got it on third cast.<br /><br />maybe thats just how it worked out for me, but if you don't seem to be getting it at grom either, jump into the water from bb and follow coast around south, on bottem after thing with 3 cannons, there are peices of land you can stand on. The thing over mini map will switch to &quot;the savage coast&quot;.<br /><br />the &quot;fished from&quot; at the top of this page has 6 areas where you can get this, if one doesn't work for you, try another. to use it, travel untill the text above your mini map, matches the listing, you are then in right area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>easy enough, just go north out grom gol, saty on waterline, when it changes to &quot;savage coast&quot; at a sand bar, stand in the water and fish deep with atleast a bauble. First couple casts you will nab one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After fishing around the southern savage coast, I had no luck. I kept moving north with still no luck. I then went even further north on an island with Lesser Water Elementals and got it on the first cast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got it first cast from the island N with the water elementals on it, i fished around the camp for about 20 minutes before that and got nothing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Stood at 29, 25 in the water as far as i could go without swimming. Had a fish attractor on, but I don't think they do anything, since you max out at 225 fishing if on this quest. Was facing west and slightly south on the successful cast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I caught this fish in the Southern Savage Coast just north of Booty Bay no need to go all the way to the northern part of stranglethorn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This time I fished from 29,27 as stated otherwise - no luck - then moving to 29,25 and going as far into the water as possible I got it in the 2nd attempt. Also with lure.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tirela</b></h3>Took me ~60 casts, 40 a hundred meters south of gromgol and 20 (where I caught it) a few more hundred meters north of gromgol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cxmwarrior</b></h3>Caught at 32,32.<br />10 second run South of Grom'gol<br />In the water next to the bottom of the waterfall that connects to the open ocean.<br />225 fishing skill, no lure, 10 casts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FroRev</b></h3>Caught it at 15.3, 11.3 on the northwestern edge of the zone in Classic, just north of Yojamba Isle near the Deadmines boat gate. No need to go close to Grom'gol if you're Alliance. I used a <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6367/big-iron-fishing-pole">Big Iron Fishing Pole</a> and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6532/bright-baubles">Bright Baubles</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Libraridan</b></h3>Pushing 100 casts all along the coast from BB on up past Grom'gol. Fighting bag space at this point. FFS... The other three were a snap.<br /><br />Swimming out to the haunted island and then using a bauble did the trick on the third cast. Maybe one trick is getting &quot;The Savage Coast&quot; to appear on your screen not just in the location above the clock. Like I said, FFS...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>blizzard60</b></h3>Caught at /way 40, 56 after about five minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jfoobar</b></h3>I have been doing this quest more times than I care to count (it's depressing, really) since vanilla and I always go to the same spot, the water in front of the waterfall just south of Grom'Gol (35,32-ish). But yeah, look at the map above. There are a ton of places that work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Birdman3310</b></h3>So just a repeated quest -- but Classic --- ignore the guides you see that say you have to go just south of Grom'Gol.<br /><br />I did it at 26, 67 like a lot of people, take a left out of booty bay, by the pirates -- just bad RNG for me, took 53 catches. All of the others were within 5-7 catches.<br /><br />Same as the desolace fish, you dont need to go near shadowprey village, just go anywhere on the west coast</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crazim</b></h3>3 hours casting in stranglethorn at the recommended spots... no dice.<br /><br />this is worse than the &quot;sifting through *!@#e&quot; quest in outlands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rageteck</b></h3>Caught this after 6 casts in <a href="/classic/zone=33/stranglethorn-vale">Stranglethorn Vale</a> at 26,20 with a fishing skill of 225 using a <a href="/classic/item=6365/strong-fishing-pole">Strong Fishing Pole</a> with a <a href="/classic/item=6532/bright-baubles">Bright Baubles</a> attached.<br /><br />/way 26,20</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MogPagle</b></h3>Jump off the pier where the ship docks in Booty Bay, swim north about 10 seconds until the subzone changes to Southern Savage Coast. You can stand on the sloping cliff and catch the fish there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>roodee</b></h3>54 casts in STV. Rest were pretty quick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PadenFain</b></h3>I was using &quot;Fish Tracking&quot; and found a spot at 31.89, 38.90 just north of Grom'gol. Farmed up about 7 Oily Blackmouth, then on the 9th cast (at same spot), got my Blue Sailfin. Hope this helps!</div>
