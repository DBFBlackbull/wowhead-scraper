<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Mages -&nbsp; sheep boss from as far away as possible, wait for other 2 to come to you.&nbsp; Frost Nova, blink to the plans, done, easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You could do what i did. No kidding. I snuck in around the 3 of them grabbed the plans w/o any aggro and got out. I had to kill zero mobs. Of course i held ontp the quest so long it's green and i am lvl 60 warrior. You do the math.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just sneak around the 3 elites... grab the plans... and sneak out.. no aggro.. no nothing..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Level 49 Warrior. Go to the boss, intimidating shout, get plans, run or die, either way it works.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>59 shaman here, staring directly at the plans and can't loot them. I had one chance but got interrupted, and now I can't open it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i 59 warr and a 53 warr couldnt kill them, to much damage or too much armor of them. its not easy as warriors -.-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a lvl 50 hunter and I sent my pet in first then I went around and got the plans.&nbsp; I did not get it the first try but it can be done.&nbsp; Use the directions to get there then send your pet first.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You must to attack simply this Overseer, to die, then come back and ress in place directly back for stone bench, which keeps Secret Plans.<br />Then safely you open it and get quest item. Then jump down and going to NPC for reward :).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did this quest at 49 solo.&nbsp; As a warlock it's easy, just pull out the voidwalker, let him run in and take the agro, run in and get the paper and jump off the balcolny.&nbsp; Be warned though, at 49 the elites had finished off big blue right as I opened the sheet, you will need to do this fast if you hope to get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did it solo (Level60 Hunter, engineer) not really :))<br /><br />I send out my pet (60) to attack the one in the middle. The 2 other elites joined the battle so I summoned my pet chicken (60) and dragon (60). And I went for the plans (Wait... wait for it.. got it)<br /><br />By the time I got the plans all 3 pets where cremated and put in jars :) All 3 where killed in about 10 seconds.<br /><br />Now I had to run :)) They followed me a freaking long way (All the way to the gate)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>after 4 tries I finally figured it out. Fought one non-elite mob outside the elite pack til low health then brought in in with me to the balcony and feared elites. Then I killed off the non-elite and picked up plans and ran :D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>at lvl 60, after sneaking in, I was able to stand on the ledge behind the plans, so I had the plans between myself and ane Overseer. As I unstealted, they did not aggro, and I could take the plans with ease, and sneak back out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just did this as a 49 warrior solo thanks to ecc3's strat.&nbsp; Grabbed the 2 non-elites outside, got one down to a sliver of health, then dragged him in.&nbsp; Feared the elites, finished the non, grabbed the plans and jumped.&nbsp; First try.&nbsp; Freaking awesome man.&nbsp; thanks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>56 lock, got past them with out aggro, but then at the last second they did, so i had to howl of terror grab them and well die. with out kiting (and whose going to do that in the slag pit?) you have to just run in, but you shouldn't have to do that with non-elite quests 5 lvls lower!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>AV popped as I was standing right infront of them. So, I charged, Indimidating shout, got the plans, and into the Battle grounds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>mind soothed my way in (had to fight one or two mobs) soothed the 3 elites, grabbed the document, jumped down and left<br /><br />easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok, I had to die several times to do this, but I just charged in and got enough rage to cast my AE fear spell.&nbsp; Once the mobs were feared I just grabbed the plans off the bench.&nbsp; That was the hardest part, grabbing it before they broke out of their fear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got these plans as a 52 druid. At first i thought i was doomed but then i used my Cinder Elemental item i got from the fire festival quest and it distracted them just long enough for me to get the plans ^^ worked like a charm. Then i droped down and nearly died to slave miners trying to escape...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did it as lvl 50 Mage, sheeped the main boss, froze the others, took the plans &amp; die. That's it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So how lucky did I get to get to the spot finally and there is a lvl 50 rare spawn to go along with the other 3 elites....makes this a little tougher.&nbsp; Sap one and blind other...pulled two back used Blade Flurry.&nbsp; Vanish.&nbsp; Killed other two.&nbsp; 60 Rogue</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did it very easily... ran into the middle, Psychic Scream -&gt; Got the Plans -&gt; Jumped off the cliff and used Levitate :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did it as a 50 rogue on my third try. I am no twink so it was hard. Sapped the big guy and hit evasion, blade flurry, adrenaline rush, and stomped the other 2 with the help of a superior healing pot. Then quickly grabbed the plans and vanished before the main elite could stomp me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i think it would be possible if u had all three elites with a shadow priest. I fought him with a 53 shadow priest, I mind controled the main guy, and his buddy attacked him. There was only one other elite though, he did a fair bit of damage but not enough. I think if their was two, you could take the main guy down to low enough so u could fear and nuke him dead, then run away, and come back and finish the last two. I tried to mind control him into some none elites, they didnt do any damage, but i did use up his mana, he does way to much damage to tank though, even with some eng trinkets. you can however just fear him and take it...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>did this solo as a lvl 47 mage.<br /><br />frost is the only way to go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did it with warlock!<br />Just get to the Balcony!<br />Send Voidwalker, take the plans and jump down the cliff! EASY</div>

Once its dead run till u lose agro. Then polly Malt again and use ur pet to dps down the last add, then let ur pet tank Malt till it runs out and just dps him down ^_^ simple</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I solo'd this at 48, but I got it because circumstances made it quite easy for me.<br /><br />These 3 hordes were ganking me all the time there, when I finally got to the overseer's chamber I died like 3 times before I got this idea. <br /><br />You see the 3 hordes were also after this item, so I just went back in as a ghost, and I waited for the horde to pull the elites away from the plans. While they were busy fighting I took the plans quietly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sap the 50, get in max range from em and pull with bow, then u blind 1 and gouge the other, then u sprint into the plans and get em --&gt; vanish</div>
