I'll make this as class unspecific as possible.\n\nFirst of all, if you can't stealth, can't take on two or more level 48-50 mobs, or are uncomfortable with dying, hold off on this quest.\n\nNow, the entrance to the tunnels you're looking for is at 55,70.&nbsp; There will be a spiralling walkway down, with a large open area at the bottom, occupied by a single bug (level 50ish).&nbsp; At the north side of the hole is a tunnel, this is where you're going.\n\nInside this tunnel, there will be a patroling wasp.&nbsp; If you can stealth, wait until he comes out of the tunnel completely, then sneak by on the west side.\n\nA very short distance into the tunnel you'll come to a bug that just sits there, and spins around every once in a while.&nbsp; This is at 56,68.&nbsp; If you're stealthing, you can get by on the west side, behind him.\n\nYou should now be in an oval shaped room.&nbsp; In here are 4-5 mobs, around level 50.&nbsp; There is a patrol that comes through here, so try to be fast.&nbsp; The easiest way to stealth through is on the west side, as there is only one bug and he is stationary.&nbsp; There is also a level 49-50 rare mob that spawns here, on the east side.\n\nThe exit to the oval room is guarded by another 49-50 mob, which is stationary.&nbsp; If stealthing, it's easier to pass on the east side.&nbsp; The tunnel will fork here again, stay to the east.\n\nInside this tunnel is a wasp that will patrol up and down, so if stealthing, wait until he reaches the northernmost part of the tunnel, then follow behind him.\n\nThis will take you into a room that has been described as star shaped many times, but I honestly see no resemblance to a star.&nbsp; It looks more like an anvil that's been tilted slightly.&nbsp; Anyway, this room is filled with mobs, so take great care in fighting.&nbsp; If you didn't kill the patrol in the previous tunnel, he will patrol here as well.\n\nThe surveying equipment is also in here, in the northwest tip of the room.&nbsp; It is guarded by a single bug, and the patrol previously mentioned comes to it as well.&nbsp; If you're stealthing, wait until the patrol gets there, and then leaves again, then you can deal with the single defender more easily.&nbsp; This is at 55,71.\n\nOne last note.&nbsp; The surveying equipment has been called a control panel many times, but once again, it looks nothing like that.&nbsp; It's basically a box with a bunch of levers and such poking out the top.\n\nHave fun completing this beast of a quest.&nbsp; I managed it as a 44 Rogue, and died three times.&nbsp; At 45 or 46, or with Master of Deception, I'm sure I could have done this with zero deaths easily.","date":"2006-09-30T11:29:44-05:00","rating":15,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Overlord","importedSubject":"Detailed Instructions"},{"commentv2":1,"number":25,"id":2642101,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Go to the top left wing of the sideways butterfly's wing.. \n\nJust be careful and you can fight one at a time..\n\nReally easy with my 47 paladin, highest level guy in the place was 50 so if you are under 47 it should be difficult.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Item may have multiple locations or of been moved. Found it myself at the pair of center tunnels. Approach the area and enter the tunnel that heads north-east, take the right tunnel once inside, and when you enter a large cavern, the gear was along the left wall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>position 55,71 underground.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In the Gaping Chasm, there are two entrances that go down into the ground with holes allowing you to get into the network of tunnels.&nbsp; One to the south and one to the north.&nbsp; The south one is straight and has one opening, the north one is a big hole in the ground and spirals down with 2 holes into the tunnels.&nbsp; You want the spiraling entrance, and you want the hole that is to the northeast (the other hole is to the southwest).<br /><br />Enter the hole and hug the right wall from there on in.&nbsp; You will go through tunnels, one chamber, more tunnels and then enter another chamber.&nbsp; As long as you hug the right wall the whole way and fight through, you will eventually come across his gear (looks like a conrol panel) in a large cavern that is shaped like a 4-pointed star.<br /><br />Good luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i found it at 56,71 just as told above it didnt disappear so it should be on the same spot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Enter the lair and turn 1st right<br />Go straight across the oval on the mini-map<br />Turn first right and down a short tunnel<br />Turn 90 degrees right (not 180 degress right) at the entrance to the large square-ish area and the loot is in the corner</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's at the exact location that those above me have stated.&nbsp; It was annoying to find (I did see it as a ghost, but my corpse was right next to it).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The item is in the star shaped room not to far in, not the round rooms. The star shaped room seems to be in the middle of the map of the nest. The item itself is on the lower side of the room (to the right as I went in), easilly seen but patrolled by a wasp and a bug.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found the gear in the star shaped room with 4 corners. In the corner in nourthwest. It took me 1 hour and 30 minutes :S.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>LOL everyone their own frame of reference i guess.. :)<br /><br />I could find it in one go with the above descriptions, the only thing that gave me trouble (lvl49 Hunter) were those damn swarms of little bugs after u kill one of the big bugs. Nothing feign death couldn't fix, but it took me just under 40 mins to complete this q, and my pet bought it at least three times... Bring food guys, and plenty of mana juice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you are soloing this at around lvl48, be sure to bring some kind of Area of Effect dmg along.<br />The Swarmers literally swarm you with up to 10 little monsters dealing 18dmg/sec each.<br /><br />Think of (hunter)Multi-shot, Volley, (Warlock)Rain of Fire, (Mage)Blizzard, Pillar of Fire, Arcane Explosion,<br /><br />Or... buy some explosives from your local engineer =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>solo as hunter 46 and hes tiger... pretty easy actually...<br />and got: <br /><br /><ul><li>4400 exp for main Q<br /></li><li>2x440 for the small talk Q<br /></li><li>5450 for deliver the note to the guy in ogrimmar<br /></li></ul><br />that is 10730 exp for so little work...<br />damn :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>55.71 for me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dude i did this with my 50 warrior and then when two bugs aggroed outside 50% of all the bugs inside the cave aggroed :S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went through the first hole that you see(the one facing southwest) and hugged the wall to the left until I got into the star shaped room.&nbsp; I found it there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can confirm 56,71.&nbsp; Also, the room is more so a squre or diamond than star.<br /><br />Goe in the larger enctance of the two, the one that is not sunk deeper into the ground.&nbsp; Being as I am 47 (Orc Hunter) I had to clear it out.&nbsp; Not hard, atleast for me.&nbsp; Once you enter there will be a large circular room on your right, skip that and keep going straight.&nbsp; You will come to another large circular room with a big stone in the middle, go around the stone and keep heading straight.&nbsp; Once you reach the large square room take the very first left, a hairpin turn, and it's in the back near the wall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>46 mage, I got inside, cleared my way thru the tunnels to get to the control panel, only to start fighting the worker near the panel, have a swarmer aggro and not have a mana jade or a mana pot to use and have to run out (through the fully popped cave) and sit high on a perch and drink to lose how pissed off I am. Damnit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>rly easy tbh... you just get a void up and SS youserlf run into the star, (easiest if you have fel domination) die then run into the room you see it in, if you have pulled to many you die again then walla you walk to the corpse and just take it. took me about 5 min(before some patch you could scout through with the eye and check where it was but its in the star as every1 said) found it in the corner southwest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All the swarms keep interupting me and prevent me from casting anything and i just kept dying, so i just pop my shield up and run to the box then die there, i rez back and use it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can anyone give me the coordinates of the holes please? I can't find them :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Underground, there's an opening in the Gaping Chasm of Tanaris. Its all the way at the bottom stay to the left and its there in a box guarded by a lil creepy crawly...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just did it at lvl 45 as a rogue, i blinded the dude by it opened it and vanished then stelthed out, no fighting need for a rogue</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i found inside the main cavern that looks kind of like a butterfly. it was on the top left side by entrance to cavern<br /><br />loc 56.71</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stick it to the right to find it and stick to the left on way out, that's all you need to know ^^ Hope screenshot helps...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've seen a lot of people saying the same thing, and a lot of people asking the same questions, so here is EXACTLY how to get there.&nbsp; I'll make this as class unspecific as possible.<br /><br />First of all, if you can't stealth, can't take on two or more level 48-50 mobs, or are uncomfortable with dying, hold off on this quest.<br /><br />Now, the entrance to the tunnels you're looking for is at 55,70.&nbsp; There will be a spiralling walkway down, with a large open area at the bottom, occupied by a single bug (level 50ish).&nbsp; At the north side of the hole is a tunnel, this is where you're going.<br /><br />Inside this tunnel, there will be a patroling wasp.&nbsp; If you can stealth, wait until he comes out of the tunnel completely, then sneak by on the west side.<br /><br />A very short distance into the tunnel you'll come to a bug that just sits there, and spins around every once in a while.&nbsp; This is at 56,68.&nbsp; If you're stealthing, you can get by on the west side, behind him.<br /><br />You should now be in an oval shaped room.&nbsp; In here are 4-5 mobs, around level 50.&nbsp; There is a patrol that comes through here, so try to be fast.&nbsp; The easiest way to stealth through is on the west side, as there is only one bug and he is stationary.&nbsp; There is also a level 49-50 rare mob that spawns here, on the east side.<br /><br />The exit to the oval room is guarded by another 49-50 mob, which is stationary.&nbsp; If stealthing, it's easier to pass on the east side.&nbsp; The tunnel will fork here again, stay to the east.<br /><br />Inside this tunnel is a wasp that will patrol up and down, so if stealthing, wait until he reaches the northernmost part of the tunnel, then follow behind him.<br /><br />This will take you into a room that has been described as star shaped many times, but I honestly see no resemblance to a star.&nbsp; It looks more like an anvil that's been tilted slightly.&nbsp; Anyway, this room is filled with mobs, so take great care in fighting.&nbsp; If you didn't kill the patrol in the previous tunnel, he will patrol here as well.<br /><br />The surveying equipment is also in here, in the northwest tip of the room.&nbsp; It is guarded by a single bug, and the patrol previously mentioned comes to it as well.&nbsp; If you're stealthing, wait until the patrol gets there, and then leaves again, then you can deal with the single defender more easily.&nbsp; This is at 55,71.<br /><br />One last note.&nbsp; The surveying equipment has been called a control panel many times, but once again, it looks nothing like that.&nbsp; It's basically a box with a bunch of levers and such poking out the top.<br /><br />Have fun completing this beast of a quest.&nbsp; I managed it as a 44 Rogue, and died three times.&nbsp; At 45 or 46, or with Master of Deception, I'm sure I could have done this with zero deaths easily.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Go to the top left wing of the sideways butterfly's wing.. <br /><br />Just be careful and you can fight one at a time..<br /><br />Really easy with my 47 paladin, highest level guy in the place was 50 so if you are under 47 it should be difficult. Also if you take too long you are going to have to fight your way back out so you might want to set your hearth to gad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, I guess they purge these TB pages b/c when i didn this quest with my hunter probabaly a year ago someone had posted a screenie with a map of the whole cave.<br /><br />Anyway, with a 50 priest I decided I didn't want to fight all the way in, so I shielded up, went in, psychic screamed, reshielded, screamed again, until i got to the butterfly room.&nbsp; Died. Ghostwalked to the butterfly room, rezzed in corner, shielded, screamed right in front of quest target, grabbed item, shielded and screamed one last time.&nbsp; HS'ed out of there and bam. Done.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Solo'd as a 45 rogue. Stealth in, hug the walls. When you get to the room there is only one mob guarding it, blind him. Loot, vanish, stealth out. Easy quest, didn't even loose 1 hp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did this as a level 49 rogue-- I had some problems with the bugs seeing through my stealth (rank 2), so watch out for that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did this easily after consulting thott for the location.&nbsp; I had to take on 3 at once a couple times, made good use of explosion traps in there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I never thought it would be possible but I actually found the Fiery Blaze Enchantment from the Badlands helpful against the bugs spawning all of the small ones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found it at 56,71. just stealted out and in, very easy. did just kill 1mob</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a miner and had Find Minerals on, was looking for the gear when I saw a Mithril deposit and decided to check it out.... next to it: 1 bug and the gear <br /><br />:D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>And no, it's not a drop from a Hazzali. It's a machine in a room with 4 <i>dead-ends</i> in the underground-hive.<br />If you are Warlock, use Eye of Kilrogg and beware of patroling Bugs.</div>
