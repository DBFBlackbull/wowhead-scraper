Druids are complex classes, not everyone can play a druid - so if you have not seen a druid change shape thoughout a battle; you have been playing with druid who really does not understand their class. Druids were under developed, talent trees were very point heavy, abilities were weak.  Also, those who couldn't multitask were forced into healbot roles.   \n3.) Healers are rare, so Druids (and Pallys) are forced into this role for raids - we should not be penalized for helping our guild. We should be rewarded! \n4.)Q: So what do we do when we want to solo or farm for money\/professions? Are you going to pay for everything, if so sign me up!\n\nOk that being said just know that there are many of us druids that used most if not all forms in a battle for solo up to 40 man raids. We fill-in gaps when something goes wrong\/or someone does not play their role well.  Because of that we many times have 3-16 slot bags full of armor and weapons.  when we change our weapons in battle, it starts the global cooldown.

I shouldn't even give you the honor of this bu...*back hands you*@#$%^ stfu. I've seen a lvl [b]30[\/b] druid take down a lvl [b]40[\/b] warrior in a duel. Hard to [b]charge[\/b] or [b]intercept[\/b] when you're [b]rooted[\/b]. OMG warriors have no way out! Unless you're a gnome LOL.((Gnome love)) Ohh wait lets just make this better. [b]Bash[\/b] since I'm a [b]feral druid[\/b] that's five or six secdons to Keep you stunned to shift and heal or I can *gasps* [b]Bash[\/b] you [b]root[\/b] you run the @#%^ away out of [b]charge[\/b] or [b]intercept[\/b] range in travel form heal up with HoT spells moonfire you once Nail you hard with Starfire Which OMG warriors never get arcane resistance. Then back to bear form. Wait OMG better yet @#%^ the bull sh*t I'll just use [b]Frienzied Regeneration[\/b] and turn my rage into a massive ammount of health every second. Warriors can't do that.*gasps*OMG I'm out of rage. My current feral tree left me five points so I put them in Furor. I'll just do a rapid shift to caster then back to bear form. Easy rage. Then top it off with Demoralising roar to reduce the damage you do then enrage to add more rage putting damage back on par. Holy @#%^. Can warriors do any of this? Nope you have to give up health to gain easy rage. Damn you're just screwed if a good feral druid wants to maul your ass. I hope a druid eats you for breakfast lunch and dinner. Shut your mouth before I send you to the n00b home for the \"gifted\" players.\"\n\n(edit) for those of you I know are going to @#$%^ at me about the legendary staff beign nearly impossible to get, SHOVE IT! Look further on and see what a feral druid has to do for good feral sets. WHICH STILL HAVE HEALING AND SPELL BENIFITS!\nAs for Priests needing healing items. I play a priest. Gues what. We get MASSIVE items that do over 100+ healing. And if you're holy lets throw a bonus on there for spirit instead of healing and get a better boost than a pissant 55. That's if you keep your spirit high. If not change to shadow and shut up. Even shadow priests get better staves. Starting with OMG Benidiction\/Anethema. Then there is a staff in BWL and OMG the legendary staff that OMFG shaman can use TOO from Naxx. So you want to !@#$% about priest healing gear blow off. There's better staves than this mace And believe me no druid\/shaman\/Paladin\/Mage\/Warlock is going to contest you for the Eye of Divinity.\n\nFor you Paladins. OMG I love you NOaladins. Just another secondary healing $%^&* class. Stick to what you're good at. Standing there and casting varius buffs. Yeah once in a green moon((more rare than a blue)) a GREAT player comes along and makes a paladin that should be worth of the title HERO in the WC game series. To those paladins I give you the utmost respect and gratitude for a job well done*bows respectfuly to those VERY select few*\n\nOkay. Now heres where I drop the Bull sh*t and start coming to the Point. Feral is not just a PvP tree. It's THE survival tree for druids who Solo or don't want to play the healing !@#$%. You say to ignore the AP boost of this mace and I say pull your head out of your ass so you can breath Richard Cranium((Richard head if You don't catch the meaning)). Do you have any damned clue what hell feral druids have to go through for GOOD feral epic gear. First there are the items from Cenarion Circle rep. The Unending life set which OMG doubles as feral\/Caster gear. OMG! The AQ hammer is great but a pipe dream at best. Then there is the Hammer of Beasial Furry. Luckily I'm on an RP server so if we beat the horde to the green dragons Sweet. But still a ^&*!@ because of the low Spawn rate. I've only seen Emeris ONCE since the release of the Dragons of Nightmare. Then there are the five Brood of Nozdormu items. WoW hope you have a few months to contribute to that slow climb or are the only person in your guild hitting BWL that is worried aobut the BoN gear. Other wise yeah. Long road to travel. Then lastly and most sadly the PvP gear. A joke at best. Hardly worth being called EPIC. And the MANY MANY hours of farming horde just frankly isn't worth it.\n\nIn short for you priest shaman and paladin wanting this mace step aside and let us druids through. We're tired of being steered in one direction. LET US HAVE OUR GEAR! Ohh also this mace isn't just for PvP.\n\n[i][small]Edited, Oct  9th  2006 at  2:27pm PDT by KaldoreiDruidOakshadow[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-10-07T19:55:56-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"First of all, take a deep breath.

As a extremely gear dependent class, the druid has always suffered due to its inability to change its equip while in combat: a druid in feral gear cannot heal or cast, a druid in cenarion and Stormrage cannot cast or melee, and a druid in moonkin gear cannot melee or heal. As of late, Blizzard's itemization in regards to the druid class has attempted to alleviate that problem. Blizzard's solution is simple: for a hybrid class, make hybrid gear. That is why pieces such as Genesis and the newly redesigned pvp rank 13 set are what they are: balanced stats for raw attack power, stamina, and mana with mild +spell damage to improve casting. The druid no longer has to wear full-out rogue gear to be good in feral forms, the druid can not acquire hybrid gear that allows them to melee and dps effectively.\n\nTHIS MACE REPRESENTS THAT!

There's no denying that. I think what everyone's arguing over is this weapon's \"All In One\" factor, added with the fact that it's a 1h weapon. With that cleared up, I don't see how anyone can say Druids SHOULDN'T have priority on this item.\n\nAs I stated, it's the \"All In One\" factor. Priest want it because it's the highest +Spell Damage on a 1h Weapon. That doesn't mean it's the best weapon for a Shadow Specced Priest - it means it's the best they can get with one hand. But wait! There's a +Healing Spells bonus on it as well! DUAL USEAGE! So lets take all this into consideration, and look at why Priest want it:\n\n- Highest +Spell Damage for a 1h Mace.\n- Healing bonus atributes allowing for multiple functionality.\n- Additional stats (5mana\/5sec, Stamina, Intellect) also provide helpful bonuses.\n\nOkay, now that that's been discussed, we can move on to Druid. As with Priest, Druids have access to multiple weapons that can provide better benefits in situational useage. Again though, it's all-in-one here! That's the name of the game. With the recent 2.0 Patch, Balance Druid is now a more viable option than ever before. I'd say the +Spell Damage more than qualifies as being useful here. The +Healing is a no brainer as well, what with all the healing Druids have to do. Finally, we have the +Attack Power that's only avaliable to Druids in a shapeshifted form. So lets look at all the benefits this weapon provides for a Druid:\n\n- Spell Damage bonus for the large number of both nature and arcane spells avaliable to Druids.\n- Healing bonus for, uh, healing.\n- Large Attack Power bonus that are ONLY accessable in Shapeshifted forms.\n- Additional stats - all of which provide useful bonuses for Druids.\n\nNow, looking at the \"All in one\" factor, it's clear to see Druid makes more use of this weapon. Any other factor at this point is a nonissue. Seriously. It DOESN'T matter. Since there IS a better weapon for every aspect the End of Dreams provides stats for, the ONLY reason to have it is because of it's multiple functionality, and with THAT in consideration Druids win simply because they can put it to better use. End of story.\n\nI keep hearing all these statements by people saying, \"There's better weapons for Druids.\" as if there's not for Priest. Another boss in the SAME Raid drops the Brimstone Staff that grants you +113 Spell Damage\/Healing Bonus AS WELL as an additional +14 to your spell's critical strike rating, +16 to your spell's hit rating, and +31 Stamina +30 Intellect, and a base DPS of 60.9. THAT is what you Priest should be drooling over. Not a damn 1-handed Mace that provides an attack bonus to a function you can't even preform.\n\nI say this to you: If Druid can simply \"get a better weapon than this\", so can a Priest. That argument is flawed, presents no logic at all, and is simply some poor excuse fabricated by a Priest to obtain this.\n\nA few other things I'd like to point out as well, just to discredit these pathic arguments a bit more. There seemed to be quite a few people pointing out how little a Druid would be making \"full\" functionality of this weapon. \"Druid is subpar DPS.\" Well there sunshine, I don't exactly see Shadow Priest topping the DPS charts in Raids, while a number of Druids have been able to out-DPS well geared Rogues. Not always the case, I know. But then again, a lot of people suck at this game - Especially a job as complicated as Druid (Well, complicated when compared to the likes of Rogues and Mages). It's easy to see see why every Druid isn't capable of massive DPS.\n\nHowever, the truth is, 90% of Druids and Priest alike will be healing in raids, making that the only \"true\" 100% useful stat on this item. The rest will be used on occassion in Raids (Moonfire blast, Priest DPS on occassion, etc.), but not constantly. That makes this mostly a PvP item, and that's where it really shines, and puts Druid No.1 on the list for this item.\n\nYes you CAN switch weapons in a fight, but in the heat of battle, are you really going to say, \"Hey, I'd better unequipped my +STR\/Stam\/AP Staff for my +Healing Staff when I shift out to cure myself so it'll have a more potent effect on me.\" No. No you're not, and you know it (Okay, so maybe a few crazy PvP'ers will). Let alone, switch between 4 different weapons everytime you assume a certain form. This weapon covers all the bases, and it does a REALLY good job at it. Not the best, but in terms of functionality, this weapon provides damn good help in all situations.\n\nEven if a Druid isn't specced a certain way, they're still going to find these attributes helpful. You don't have to be Balance Specced in Moonkin Form to find the ~95 Damage to your Moonfires helpful. What about us Druids forced to spec Resto for the sake of our Guilds? Should our DPS\/melee capabilities fall flat because we weren't allowed to spec Feral? Well, the additional +AP now helps us make up for that. It's little things like that you Priest aren't aware of, and want to screw us out of because you want a 1h DPS weapon for Shadow Spec.\n\nIn closing, I'd just like to point out something on a more personal note. Druids already have a lot of crap. Seriously. My 60 Rogue has his normal armor. Aside from it, he has a handful of NR and FR gear for raiding, as well as a few extra pieces to help mix and match his gear depending on the situation. Overall, I'd say he has 2 1\/2, possibly 3 sets of gear (in terms of the amount of pieces).\n\nMy Druid has no less than 6. We have the healing set for raids - possibly numerous pieces for the same slot. Then we have a PvP set. Additionally, we have pieces geared for tanking, DPS, casting\/dmg, and hybrid gear. Not entirely full sets for all of those, but a number of pieces for those purposes. Not to mention the FR\/NR gear we have to get as well. The sheer number of things we have to obtain is ridiculous.\n\nI know, I know . . . It comes with the territory. You know what Druids like though? We like those few pieces of gear we get that are ACTUALLY effective hybrid pieces. This is one of those few items. Call me greedy if you will, but it'd be nice to finally not to have to carry around half a bag full of various weapons for a situation I may or may not encounter at that time. But hey, Priest need their 1h DPS Maces, right!\n\np.s. With Patch 2.0, all aspects of the Druid got a major boost, making this weapon even more effect for all their forms.","date":"2006-12-11T13:43:02-06:00","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"TheSoulTakerX","importedSubject":"My 2 Cents"},{"commentv2":1,"number":83,"id":3094933,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Yeah the bottom part of the weapons EQUIP: List pretty much says a priest can NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER roll on this UNLESS...

Lots of damage/healing for balance/resto druids, absolutely insane amounts of AP for feral druids. Top it off with mana/5secs and you got a winner.<br />It's nice to see Blizzard giving druids something that's actually useful (even if it's only available to raiding guilds).<br />It looks like it's made of bone, pretty much like it's icon. Looks awesome :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Geno</b></h3>Truely, I feel this is the &quot;End of the Dreams&quot; that Druids have to look for a weapon for all. I'd burn all my points on this sucker first time it drops. 95 damage outclasses Hand of Nef (Which I currently use), and to get Mp5 on it is just beautiful (Balance spec, mind you, so any Mp5 with good damage is a boost). Hell, I even get AP in feral (And I have a decent feral set for when I need to tank Jin'do or go solo'ing a while, and don't want to cast), so I only need to swap in Tome of Knowledge over Jin'do's bag of Whammies.<br /><br />This is the End of Dreams for me... And the beginning of a reality ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4250</b></h3>There's no 'possibly' to this. It IS the best Hybrid weapon in the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>613</b></h3>This could have been 2-hand still been crazy good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4307</b></h3>Awesome weapon, for sure.<br /><br />Additionally though, I've seen leaked images from BC of items with an AP bonus whilst in Feral and Moonkin forms. If this is an across the board change, with the changes to Moonkin form, this would make an already sweet item that little bit moreso, for a heavy balance druid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Buckwyld</b></h3>Many have considered this the best Priest and Shaman weapon in the game for PvP due to its high amount of damage and mana regeneration.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thebrassthief</b></h3>This is the Druids wet dream. Any Druid. ANY kind of Druid can get benefit. I don't even have to say anymore. IMO, if any other class gets this over a Druid, it is travesty (and I know other classes get this over Druids -_-). If I ever see Naxx with my Druid, all my DKP will be saved for this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3118</b></h3>Lets not split hairs. This is a great druid piece, to be sure but there are better healing items. Hiding behind the +dmg/healing and lame MP/5 is 300+AP. There. I said it. Druids love cat form. I don't feel bad about druids not getting this item over other classes. I don't feel bad about shadow priests getting +shadow damage gear after warlocks. If I had a paladin or shaman on raid with a Lok I'd expect them to bid on this piece. Feeding feral dreams is not what keeps Naxx progression.<br /><br />Now that I sounded plenty mean, I want to reiterate that it truly is a (the) druid weapon. I think people get jealous of how insanely good this one piece is. It'd bring out the same feelings as if <br />Herald of Woe<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19357">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19357</a><br /><br />had 105.6 DPS. Warriors would say &quot;hang the intel, thats an amazing warrior weapon.&quot; Druids have a hard job and take a lot of flak - go you, Bearface McGee.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6812</b></h3>Blizzard adding +ap to feral forms on items was a nice solution to druids not getting the use of a weapons dps, but the way it has been implemented on items causes allot of problems. The hammer of bestial fury is a great tanking item, and this is a great priest/shaman/paladin +damage weapon, clearly superior to Hand of nef. <br /><br />In my opinion a much better solution would have been to give druids attack power in cat/bear form based on whatever weapon they are using's dps, but then again I don't work for blizz. <br /><br />Because it is one of only 4 items in the game with +ap in forms in the game, it is hard to take this away from eager druids however,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sheanna</b></h3>This is an amazing druid weapon. Blessed Qiraji Warhammer eclipses it slightly in pure feral dps and tanking, but for PvP and other hybrid orriented situations, this is tops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7779</b></h3>That is an insain weapon for a feral druid IMO. simply WOW. its too bad i saw a shaman with it a couple weeks ago :(.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Drew4567</b></h3>Although this weapon is aimed directly towards a druid, some guilds may feel that a shaman could use this for healing as well. The attack power, however, would be useless to any other class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>crescentwindx</b></h3>At the time of posting, this is also the best main hand weapon for a Shadow Priest in the game. Bar none.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6833</b></h3>As a feral druid I would not take this over a moonkin/pure hybrid build druid and instead take the AQ40 warhammer.<br /><br />Whilst this item does indeed scream druid, you have to realise unless it has &quot;class:druid&quot; written on it, you will be seeing it in the hands of a shaman/paladin/priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>35664</b></h3>pure druid weapon. the best for feral druids</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well this is definitely for Druids only; Blizz did a good job this time ensuring that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found out where this thing comes from etc<br /><br />According to <a href="http://wowwalkthroughs.free.fr/NaxxramasBoss.html" rel="nofollow">http://wowwalkthroughs.free.fr/NaxxramasBoss.html</a><br /><br />This item is dropped in the Abomination wing off of Grobbulus <a href="http://wowwalkthroughs.free.fr/Boss/Grobbulus.html" rel="nofollow">http://wowwalkthroughs.free.fr/Boss/Grobbulus.html</a><br /><br />Which is VERY good news seeing as he is a very early boss in the instance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This weapon is so OK that you dont need to swap weapons anymore. Place Sartura's Might next to it and you got yourself +140 healing and about +90 damage on spells. Mix it up with AQ setitems and you are in PvP completely allround. <br /><br />Nevertheless, for pure balance or pure feral this item also is for now a very very good choice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You all seem to be either in a very very bad guild or in one that won't see the inside of Naxx in a lifetime.<br />I am 200% sure, that no other class in my guild will spend dkp on this, as long as there is a druid, no matter what specc, in the raid.<br />This is, at least, the ultimate Druid PVP weapon for ANY Druid, because a druid is supposed to use all his forms in order to maximize his performance.<br />PVEwise Resto and Balance Druids already should have a better weapon, so this should then go to a Feral Druid. But in fact, this is just insanely awesome for every Druid, that uses the full potential of his class, and no other class should be allowed to bid on this, as long as there is a druid guildmate that still desires it. Being in one guild also means being respectful to each other. If a Priest would bid higher on this, than a druid, it would still go to the druid. At least, that's the way we handle it in my giuld.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This one drops in addomination wing the second boss Grobbulus is the one holding it :p. This fight is atleast easier than patchwerk!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it's very usable by any a priest, druid, shaman, or paladin.<br /><br />quite. useful. Feral druids take all of the weapon into use, but oh well. I'd take this mace. It is an upgrade from Lok'amir. However...if I was in a raid, and my feral druid friend was there and this dropped - I wouldn't want to be the one who &amp;*!@s on him.<br /><br />sure classes can use it - but if you have a feral druid with you - you'd probably let them have it. unless you're a %^&amp;*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>- excellent graphics<br />- awesome stats<br />- truly &quot;epic&quot; name<br /><br />Now if only you wouldn't have to go to Naxxramas to get it...*sigh*<br />Not that I wouldn't work for it, but still...<br /><br />Well, sooner or later one will end up there. When I reached lvl60 with my druid I said to myself: &quot;Ha, I'm never gonna end up in BWL or anything like that.&quot;<br />Well, I'm starting to collect T2 now ;)<br /><br />Just take one step at a time and you can reach anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a feral druid.<br /><br />I think I just creamed in my pants a little...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For anyone who thinks that this should be for a priest, pally or shaman, please just wait until all the druids in your guild have it. If you still want it fine, but until then this is a druid weapon. <br /><br />I am a balance/resto druid, but I have gear sets for every situation. I PVP a lot, and I use all my forms every day. I heal for boss fights, but otherwise I am usually casting or going feral for damage. I have gotten #$%^ in the past for rolling on the staff of dominance, talon of furious concentration, and pretty much any non-class specific item that doesn't have healing on it. I'm not trying to be mean to other classes, but before AQ40 and there are very few options for feral and balance druids that are druid specific. If you let a druid take this weapon, it will satisfy almost any spec, and eliminate the need to bid on other non-class specific weapons that may be more appropriate for the other caster classes. I would use this mace in every situation, except possibly tanking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If I was a guild leader, I'd slap anyone who tried to take this ahead of a Druid. It balances out any spec they have decided to take. +healing for feral, +damage and +ap for resto, +healing and +ap for Balance spec. It is the perfect Druid mace, like Benediction/Anathema for Priests but even better. All other classes will just have to &quot;make due&quot; with any of the other amazing epic items from Naxx and AQ40. So sorry. :(<br /><br />The order should go like Druid -&gt; Shaman/Paladin -&gt; anyone else who wants it. Period. To do it any other way is not only ridiculous, but taking a dump on the class this was obviously intended for. And if you think that's reasonable just to make your greedy guildmates happy, then maybe your Druids would be better off somewhere else. <br /><br />I say this as a shadow priest, who often had to deal with rolling on contested gear. This is up there with Sash of Whispered Secrets to me personally as a &quot;Boy I would like it but I'm not a prick&quot; kind of item because the HP regen/shadow damage combination is way more useful to a warlock. (That and I got a Mana Igniting Cord anyway of course. :P)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Every just remember that this drops in Naxxramas. To the 98% of posters here, for or against druids' right to this weapon, they will not be seeing this content for probably another 6 months or longer, while they are still fighting through MC, or stalled on Vael. So, the only people who are going to be seeing this are those who have been playing a mighty long time. In the raiding guilds that do Naxxramas, they have one intention: clearing and getting Naxx on Farm. Hence, every item will go to the most deserving, most raid-beneficial person in the raid. The primary MT will get EVERY piece of Dreadnaughts before any other warriors. And, as a guild, if they deem that a druid will get the most benefit from this, a druid will get it. I can actually see some druids (modest ones) willing to pass this to other classes if they are Resto specced, since spare the AP, some classes can benefit more from those stats. However, if the raid has a feral, balance, or any hybrid druid that RAIDS AS A FERAL, BALANCE OR ANY HYBRID, then its a given that they will recieve this. If you raid with 3 druids that only heal, Innervate priests and /dance when the tank is full or they're regenerating, then they would likely think twice about getting this for raiding. Because this far into end-game, people know their classes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>right.. because this is the best druid weapon for both feral and healing.. you lie</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to give people a good basis of comparison:<br /><br />A druid using the End of Dreams effectively has a 73 DPS weapon in bear form and a 77 DPS weapon in cat form. That's much more than Zinrokh, more than The Untamed Blade, and almost as much as Ashkandi. It gives them the DPS of an epic 2-handed weapon while keeping the offhand slot free for a stat item (now if only Blizzard would add a feral offhand).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone who is rolling or spending dkp for this and is not a druid needs to die.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The only way ANYONE besides a druid should have this is if EVERY druid in the raid has one. This is the best 1 handed druid weapon in the game. AND ALL OF YOU SHAMANS THAT I SEE WEILDING THIS<br /><br />YOU SUCK!<br /><br />I have yet to see a druid with this mace</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Druid Mace<br /><br />This druids mace :DD<br /><br />anyone who takes this before a druid should delete there account<br /><br />and ty blizz for nerfin the stats to make it less tempting to non droods /hug</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So they don't let feral druids into end game but they let shadow priests interesting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just because you have a feral druid in your guild that doesnt know wtf hes doing and doesnt know how to play feral doesnt mean feral druids cant dps<br /><br />ACTUALLY why is it always feral druid's damage vs. rogues'? I mean what not compare feral druids against mages, warlocks, hunters and fury warriors? i'd say if a feral druid can out dps a person in the raid of one of these classes then he/she deserves to be in the raid<br /><br />one last thing SKILL&gt;GEAR but if you don't have gear your &amp;*!@ed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Our guild believes that this weapon is definitely a drood weapon, but other classes can use as well. To compensate, our guild has this rule:<br /><br />Droods can apply for the priority at the cost of all other PvP weapons in Naxx. If you want to get this mace when you have less DKP than Pri/Pal, you would not be able to bid on Midnight Haze, Brimstone Staff &amp; Soulseeker, etc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Over all the stats, I've gone crazy over the name...The End of Dreams. The peacebloom-smokers at Blizz HQ (a.k.a. Dev team) really deserved their salaries, imo. Truly epic weapon, truly epic name. 'Nuff said.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>...And I still want this mace. I don't want to grind lower city rep to exalted to get a dorky blue mace; I want this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As you can no doubt tell by looking at the stats, it is one of the best damage 1h weapons in the game. That 305 attack power is utterly meaningless, even when it comes to determining its item level. This weapon will go to whatever caster jolly well wants it who can use it. Besides, raiding Druids may want to look into some staves, perhaps a Widow's Embrace or a Scepter of the False Prophet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>after you read this you will laugh :O<br />last week there was our first dropp of end of dreams. by the way i have collectet some moonkin equip over some month but i do not have the right to get staff of shadowflame. so i decieded to wait for end of dreams. finally he dropps and i get him for 1256 dkp. normally you can get ~100dkp every raid day. i asked some druids how many dkp they bet on it. the only druid bet 100 dkp. after some asking i find out that a paladin leecht me for 1100 ^&amp;*!ing dkp. it were not a problem if it was 200 oder so. but 1100 dkp are 11 raiddays and we only raid 3 times s week. our normal raidleader does not have internet at the moment. last week the raidleadership decided someone new. and he actually said to me that end of dreams is a pvp item and everybody who can wear it has the right to get it and wants to have some fun in pvp with it. i will not challenge his opinion that he said that this is a good pvp item for paladins and priests, but it was our first drop and with the attackpower it is like there stand druid on this damn item.<br /><br />so i wanted to ask, is there any raid who give end of dreams at paladins if there are druids who want to take it? (i repeat it again ;) it was our FIRST drop)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>so at all, priests should better go on grand marshalls warhammer, still better with 135 healing and 6mana/5secs and let druids take this nice mace</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This AP bonus for druids is not something to give priority for. All points about feral druids tanking in raids does not mean anything because AP does nothing for tanking. This is nice for pvp or dps:ing. It's just that a druid can get use of this in feral form too, not just casting. <br /><br />A druid cannot benefit from both bonuses at same time. You spam moonfire and get nice bonus to it, or go catform and do melee damage or you get healing bonus when healing. But the dmg&amp;heal bonus does not help in feral form or the AP bonus in caster form. It's no reason for giving priority. A priest gets full benefit from this same way that a druid gets. You get bonus no matter if you heal or dps.<br /><br />This AP bonus is just blizzards way to enable this dps piece for feral form too, not just casting. It's not a druid only weapon. If Blizzard intended that, they would have restricted it to druids only.<br /><br />I am a priest and when this drops, I'm going to dump a $%^&amp;load of dkp to get it. It's also a pretty common drop in opposite to lok'amir so don't cry if you dont get the first one. We have 6 bosses down in Naxx so should be there soon :) Can't wait!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the AQ40 mace is trash compared to this. No class but a druid can use this to its fullest.<br /><br />this is by far the best druid item short of the legendary staff. Period.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The End of Dreams, is a druid weapon. I know alot of Priests shamans and loladins would want this weapon aswell, because of the spell damits. Im a resto specced druid, and if anyone took this Mace before all the druids in the raid has it i would /gquit right away.<br /><br />And what is the point about the AQ warhammer?, the warriors can get the pugio, which they should dual wield in the offhand if they want to do damits... DW fury will out damits a 2hander anyday, so dont even go there. We have a warrior with TF and Pugio, nobody is even close to him on the damage meter. he tanks Onyxia with DW and is the number1 damits dealer, even he doesnt do much damage in phase 2. So dont say warriors need the AQ warhammer.<br /><br />And for those saying only 1 enchant per weapon, so they can just change weapon while in combat, are u serious? in BGøs i change forms like 5 times every minute, no way in hell u cna change your weapon that many times, and be efficient. <br /><br />Anyways, this weapon is for druids, then the rest. not the other way around.<br />Just let the druids be happy for once, and give them The end of Dreams</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow this is the craziest thread I have ever seen. If you are not a Druid maybe you shouldn't guess whats best for a Druid case this is the best item in the game other then the staff of Medivh. If your a pally or a Shammie use this<br /><a href="/classic/item=22942/the-widows-embrace">The Widow's Embrace</a> do people say the +AP in Bear and Cat forms don't mean it shouldn't go to a druid first?<br />Also if you have never seen a Druid tank in a 40 man instance its because your guild has decided not to do that (silly really) and for the guy that says a druid cant block a crushing blow! well neither can a warrior! so think before you talk silly. My guild does use Druids as tanks and yes on some bosses they are the MT, the armor and HP are way easier to heal (I know cause I am the guy healing them). So if you guys are silly enough to let a pally or a shammie roll first on this, it will only slow your guild that much more from clearing an instance faster. In the end it will be up to your guild cause there is no way you are going to get this without a good guild...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Many people think &quot;Balance druids, what a joke! They can't get close to the mage's and warlock's dps!&quot;<br /><br />Our sucky gear makes us suck. It's like a glass wall we can't get passed. The better the gear we get, the better we become. Unfortunately, it's 3 times as hard to get the optimal gear as other classes.<br /><br />Druids, being virtually the most gear and spec dependent class in the game, have horrible itemization(not you resto people). That just doesn't make sense. Finally, Blizz comes out with an AWESOME overall druid weapon, and I hear priests say they could use this more effectively than a druid. That just pisses me off.<br /><br />This weapon benifits balance druids, moonkin more specifically, more than feral and resto druids. +320 AP in Moonkin form is a HUGE increase in our mana regeneration. Spell Dmg/Heal and the stats, well that's self explanitory.<br /><br />Shadow priest can get a HELL of a lot better weapon than this.<br /><br />P.S. If you haven't seen a druid use all of his forms, watch this video: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6410143840993150437&amp;q=Balance+Highway" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6410143840993150437&amp;q=Balance+Highway</a><br /><i>Note: The video was made way before the 2.0.3 patch</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a 'complete' weapon for both druids and priests, being useful to all forms/roles. It provides a bonus to all spells, as well as being useful for feral forms.<br /><br />However, given the nature of the item, the fact that you can switch weapons in combat, and particularly the nature of druid armor itemization, I would say that this item is primarily suited to spell damage.<br /><br />Druid: <br />Feral - If you want to use this for feral, you're going to want a feral enchant and you're going to want to wear feral armor. Because of this, the character as a whole will be unsuited to spellcasting, and so the non-feral aspects of the weapon aren't very useful. Especially considering that you can switch weapon in combat, and that the weapon can only have an enchant suited to <i>one</i> role, the Blessed Qiraji Warhammer ( <a href="/classic/item=21268/blessed-qiraji-war-hammer">Blessed Qiraji War Hammer</a> ) from AQ40 is much better for feral.<br />Balance - well suited to balance, throw on a spellpower enchant and there's probably not much better that you can get.<br />Restoration - there are significantly better 1h healing maces, and these are made further better by the healing enchant you can place on them.<br /><br />Priest:<br />Healing - there are significantly better 1h healing maces, which are also better suited to the +healing enchant.<br />Damage - well suited to both holy and shadow damage aspects, probably no better option available, and possibly this is where the weapon is best maximized (since of the four classes that can use this, the priest class is biggest on the damage spellcaster side of things due to not having a physical aspect).<br /><br />Paladin/Shaman:<br />For healing, again there are much better 1h maces.<br />For physical damage, this weapon is very lacking.<br />For an elementalist shaman - well suited to the spellcaster focus of an elementalist.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You know, I would not mind if others rolled againt me on this weapon IF we Druids were allowed to roll on any item that we can use. But alas, this is not the case. <br /><br />Just so you know, Druids do not equal healbot. <br />1.)Only lazy players believe that druids can only heal. <br />2.) Druids are complex classes, not everyone can play a druid - so if you have not seen a druid change shape thoughout a battle; you have been playing with druid who really does not understand their class. Druids were under developed, talent trees were very point heavy, abilities were weak. Also, those who couldn't multitask were forced into healbot roles. <br />3.) Healers are rare, so Druids (and Pallys) are forced into this role for raids - we should not be penalized for helping our guild. We should be rewarded! <br />4.)Q: So what do we do when we want to solo or farm for money/professions? Are you going to pay for everything, if so sign me up!<br /><br />Ok that being said just know that there are many of us druids that used most if not all forms in a battle for solo up to 40 man raids. We fill-in gaps when something goes wrong/or someone does not play their role well. Because of that we many times have 3-16 slot bags full of armor and weapons. when we change our weapons in battle, it starts the global cooldown. Every second counts - so not switching a weapon is VERY benneficial. Druids should always have first roll on this mace period. Unless we were able to roll for any other +spelldamage, +crit, +intel, +strength, +agility, +healing, +AP Cloth/Leather/weapon that drops that we can equip... Think on that for a bit.<br /><br />Thats what i thought... <br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 20th 2006 9:56am by malzon</i></div>

There are good daggers and swords for you priests/paladins/shamans, please give priority to druids who knows how to play other than healer role too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First thing is first though. Hunters I swear I'll start hunting all of you down if you don't stop acting like idiots when it comes to weapons you CANNOT USE!<br /><br />Okay. I've read over a hundred posts on here and alot of them saying feral druids suck and can't tank/dps or that the 305SP to feral combat forms doesn't mean sh*t. Time to get pimp slapped.<br /><br />Okay on page three some dumb ass said warriors can out survive bear druids LOL. Here's my response to that incase no one goes back and reads for a good laugh.<br /><br />&quot;Wait let me get this right. You're talking about combat survivability? Dude you @#%^ing n00b. I shouldn't even give you the honor of this bu...*back hands you*@#$%^ stfu. I've seen a lvl <b>30</b> druid take down a lvl <b>40</b> warrior in a duel. Hard to <b>charge</b> or <b>intercept</b> when you're <b>rooted</b>. OMG warriors have no way out! Unless you're a gnome LOL.((Gnome love)) Ohh wait lets just make this better. <b>Bash</b> since I'm a <b>feral druid</b> that's five or six secdons to Keep you stunned to shift and heal or I can *gasps* <b>Bash</b> you <b>root</b> you run the @#%^ away out of <b>charge</b> or <b>intercept</b> range in travel form heal up with HoT spells moonfire you once Nail you hard with Starfire Which OMG warriors never get arcane resistance. Then back to bear form. Wait OMG better yet @#%^ the bull sh*t I'll just use <b>Frienzied Regeneration</b> and turn my rage into a massive ammount of health every second. Warriors can't do that.*gasps*OMG I'm out of rage. My current feral tree left me five points so I put them in Furor. I'll just do a rapid shift to caster then back to bear form. Easy rage. Then top it off with Demoralising roar to reduce the damage you do then enrage to add more rage putting damage back on par. Holy @#%^. Can warriors do any of this? Nope you have to give up health to gain easy rage. Damn you're just screwed if a good feral druid wants to maul your ass. I hope a druid eats you for breakfast lunch and dinner. Shut your mouth before I send you to the n00b home for the &quot;gifted&quot; players.&quot;<br /><br />(edit) for those of you I know are going to @#$%^ at me about the legendary staff beign nearly impossible to get, SHOVE IT! Look further on and see what a feral druid has to do for good feral sets. WHICH STILL HAVE HEALING AND SPELL BENIFITS!<br />As for Priests needing healing items. I play a priest. Gues what. We get MASSIVE items that do over 100+ healing. And if you're holy lets throw a bonus on there for spirit instead of healing and get a better boost than a pissant 55. That's if you keep your spirit high. If not change to shadow and shut up. Even shadow priests get better staves. Starting with OMG Benidiction/Anethema. Then there is a staff in BWL and OMG the legendary staff that OMFG shaman can use TOO from Naxx. So you want to !@#$% about priest healing gear blow off. There's better staves than this mace And believe me no druid/shaman/Paladin/Mage/Warlock is going to contest you for the Eye of Divinity.<br /><br />For you Paladins. OMG I love you NOaladins. Just another secondary healing $%^&amp;* class. Stick to what you're good at. Standing there and casting varius buffs. Yeah once in a green moon((more rare than a blue)) a GREAT player comes along and makes a paladin that should be worth of the title HERO in the WC game series. To those paladins I give you the utmost respect and gratitude for a job well done*bows respectfuly to those VERY select few*<br /><br />Okay. Now heres where I drop the Bull sh*t and start coming to the Point. Feral is not just a PvP tree. It's THE survival tree for druids who Solo or don't want to play the healing !@#$%. You say to ignore the AP boost of this mace and I say pull your head out of your ass so you can breath Richard Cranium((Richard head if You don't catch the meaning)). Do you have any damned clue what hell feral druids have to go through for GOOD feral epic gear. First there are the items from Cenarion Circle rep. The Unending life set which OMG doubles as feral/Caster gear. OMG! The AQ hammer is great but a pipe dream at best. Then there is the Hammer of Beasial Furry. Luckily I'm on an RP server so if we beat the horde to the green dragons Sweet. But still a ^&amp;*!@ because of the low Spawn rate. I've only seen Emeris ONCE since the release of the Dragons of Nightmare. Then there are the five Brood of Nozdormu items. WoW hope you have a few months to contribute to that slow climb or are the only person in your guild hitting BWL that is worried aobut the BoN gear. Other wise yeah. Long road to travel. Then lastly and most sadly the PvP gear. A joke at best. Hardly worth being called EPIC. And the MANY MANY hours of farming horde just frankly isn't worth it.<br /><br />In short for you priest shaman and paladin wanting this mace step aside and let us druids through. We're tired of being steered in one direction. LET US HAVE OUR GEAR! Ohh also this mace isn't just for PvP.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 9th 2006 at 2:27pm PDT by KaldoreiDruidOakshadow</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The other stats scream casting, priest, pally, shaman. But with the feral AP bonus of over 300, it's meant for druids, but that shouldn't stop other classes from wanting to use it due to high spell damage/healing, mana regen and good stamina/int bonuses.<br /><br />Druid gets this item if someone to prioritize.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i think the reason people go for how good this is for feral is becuase of the massive amount attackpower it gives. dont ignore the spell dmg! this also great for a moonkin druid too. 95 more dmg on wrath..!:P and i think thats alot even on healing too:P its good to see blizzard distributing this item to naxxramas, since, from what i've heard, druids have been cheated on which items they get. cant get any +dmg equipment since its mostly cloth and warlocks and mages seem to have priority on that and that even a priest might say he wants it for pvp... i dunno, im just ranting...:P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Paladins, Priests and Shamans who are allowed to have this mace over a Druid who wants it is just stupid...<br /><br />I have the first in my guild and server, and the top guilds that kill Grob give Druids priority of this weapon over other mace classes.<br /><br />I use it for healing with Sartura's Might (and as part of my feral kit too, having almost 300+ healing and 1300AP isn't bad right?) - cos hell, less than 5% drop of Scepter of the False Prophet off C'thun is too far off to wait for :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>my hunter would own with this kk?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my opinion, this weapon is designed as a way of proliferation blizzard's redefinition of how the druid class operates. As a extremely gear dependent class, the druid has always suffered due to its inability to change its equip while in combat: a druid in feral gear cannot heal or cast, a druid in cenarion and Stormrage cannot cast or melee, and a druid in moonkin gear cannot melee or heal. As of late, Blizzard's itemization in regards to the druid class has attempted to alleviate that problem. Blizzard's solution is simple: for a hybrid class, make hybrid gear. That is why pieces such as Genesis and the newly redesigned pvp rank 13 set are what they are: balanced stats for raw attack power, stamina, and mana with mild +spell damage to improve casting. The druid no longer has to wear full-out rogue gear to be good in feral forms, the druid can not acquire hybrid gear that allows them to melee and dps effectively.<br /><br />THIS MACE REPRESENTS THAT! The ability to cast and dps on a single weapon is paramount to a hybrid druid build.<br /><br />This weapon is also designed to help scale feral dps with other melee classes. Ublike rogues and warriors who can acquire new weapons with higher and higher dps, the druid is stuck at a set dps for each of its feral forms. This weapon is designed specifically to keep feral dps somewhat competitive with other melee classes.<br /><br />If you are not a druid, and you somehow delude yourself into thinking you deserve it - you probably aren't in a guild good enough to be in naxx anyways.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK...I dont see why people argue about this mace...its for a druid first, thats all there is to it. It is good for you guys, but you have other items you can get that would work just fine. Serious if you want it because its good for damage as a priest or paladin or shaman...you want it for pvp more than raiding...we are all healers when it comes to naxx...yes there are some of us who dont do that, ive seen videos of druids tanking nef blah blah, but id say 95% of us are healers, so when this drops, you may want it just as bad as a druid, but it just gets more use for a druid, simple and plain. There are many other good healing weapons, like this.<br /><br />Hammer of the Twisting Nether <br />Binds when picked up <br />Unique <br />One-Hand Mace <br />36.77 - 120.77 Damage Speed 1.90 <br />(41.5 damage per second) <br />+8 Stamina<br />+11 Intellect<br /><br />Healing Spells +55 <br /><br />Requires Level 60 <br />Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 238.<br />Equip: Restores 8 mana per 5 sec. <br /><br />Go get it...I dont see an argument with this weapon unless it drops like 7 times and all your druids have it...suck it up and use a sword...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can some one explain to me why people keep trying to view this as a healing weapon. It is not a healing weapon. Its a dps weapon. Comparing this with sartura's might to the augur staff from AQ is dumb. The Augur staff is +healing only, not +dmg/healing. If you want to compare something to the Augur staff compare the mace from Faerlina, +161 healing on that mace, thats a healing mace.

LET'S MAKE SURE NO SORRY DUMBASS RUINS THIS THREAD.<br /><br />THIS IS A DROOD WEAPON KLOL?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So many flaws in so many arguments. *Sigh*<br /><br />First off, there's better items for situational uses for both Priest and Druid. There's no denying that. I think what everyone's arguing over is this weapon's &quot;All In One&quot; factor, added with the fact that it's a 1h weapon. With that cleared up, I don't see how anyone can say Druids SHOULDN'T have priority on this item.<br /><br />As I stated, it's the &quot;All In One&quot; factor. Priest want it because it's the highest +Spell Damage on a 1h Weapon. That doesn't mean it's the best weapon for a Shadow Specced Priest - it means it's the best they can get with one hand. But wait! There's a +Healing Spells bonus on it as well! DUAL USEAGE! So lets take all this into consideration, and look at why Priest want it:<br /><br />- Highest +Spell Damage for a 1h Mace.<br />- Healing bonus atributes allowing for multiple functionality.<br />- Additional stats (5mana/5sec, Stamina, Intellect) also provide helpful bonuses.<br /><br />Okay, now that that's been discussed, we can move on to Druid. As with Priest, Druids have access to multiple weapons that can provide better benefits in situational useage. Again though, it's all-in-one here! That's the name of the game. With the recent 2.0 Patch, Balance Druid is now a more viable option than ever before. I'd say the +Spell Damage more than qualifies as being useful here. The +Healing is a no brainer as well, what with all the healing Druids have to do. Finally, we have the +Attack Power that's only avaliable to Druids in a shapeshifted form. So lets look at all the benefits this weapon provides for a Druid:<br /><br />- Spell Damage bonus for the large number of both nature and arcane spells avaliable to Druids.<br />- Healing bonus for, uh, healing.<br />- Large Attack Power bonus that are ONLY accessable in Shapeshifted forms.<br />- Additional stats - all of which provide useful bonuses for Druids.<br /><br />Now, looking at the &quot;All in one&quot; factor, it's clear to see Druid makes more use of this weapon. Any other factor at this point is a nonissue. Seriously. It DOESN'T matter. Since there IS a better weapon for every aspect the End of Dreams provides stats for, the ONLY reason to have it is because of it's multiple functionality, and with THAT in consideration Druids win simply because they can put it to better use. End of story.<br /><br />I keep hearing all these statements by people saying, &quot;There's better weapons for Druids.&quot; as if there's not for Priest. Another boss in the SAME Raid drops the Brimstone Staff that grants you +113 Spell Damage/Healing Bonus AS WELL as an additional +14 to your spell's critical strike rating, +16 to your spell's hit rating, and +31 Stamina +30 Intellect, and a base DPS of 60.9. THAT is what you Priest should be drooling over. Not a damn 1-handed Mace that provides an attack bonus to a function you can't even preform.<br /><br />I say this to you: If Druid can simply &quot;get a better weapon than this&quot;, so can a Priest. That argument is flawed, presents no logic at all, and is simply some poor excuse fabricated by a Priest to obtain this.<br /><br />A few other things I'd like to point out as well, just to discredit these pathic arguments a bit more. There seemed to be quite a few people pointing out how little a Druid would be making &quot;full&quot; functionality of this weapon. &quot;Druid is subpar DPS.&quot; Well there sunshine, I don't exactly see Shadow Priest topping the DPS charts in Raids, while a number of Druids have been able to out-DPS well geared Rogues. Not always the case, I know. But then again, a lot of people suck at this game - Especially a job as complicated as Druid (Well, complicated when compared to the likes of Rogues and Mages). It's easy to see see why every Druid isn't capable of massive DPS.<br /><br />However, the truth is, 90% of Druids and Priest alike will be healing in raids, making that the only &quot;true&quot; 100% useful stat on this item. The rest will be used on occassion in Raids (Moonfire blast, Priest DPS on occassion, etc.), but not constantly. That makes this mostly a PvP item, and that's where it really shines, and puts Druid No.1 on the list for this item.<br /><br />Yes you CAN switch weapons in a fight, but in the heat of battle, are you really going to say, &quot;Hey, I'd better unequipped my +STR/Stam/AP Staff for my +Healing Staff when I shift out to cure myself so it'll have a more potent effect on me.&quot; No. No you're not, and you know it (Okay, so maybe a few crazy PvP'ers will). Let alone, switch between 4 different weapons everytime you assume a certain form. This weapon covers all the bases, and it does a REALLY good job at it. Not the best, but in terms of functionality, this weapon provides damn good help in all situations.<br /><br />Even if a Druid isn't specced a certain way, they're still going to find these attributes helpful. You don't have to be Balance Specced in Moonkin Form to find the ~95 Damage to your Moonfires helpful. What about us Druids forced to spec Resto for the sake of our Guilds? Should our DPS/melee capabilities fall flat because we weren't allowed to spec Feral? Well, the additional +AP now helps us make up for that. It's little things like that you Priest aren't aware of, and want to screw us out of because you want a 1h DPS weapon for Shadow Spec.<br /><br />In closing, I'd just like to point out something on a more personal note. Druids already have a lot of crap. Seriously. My 60 Rogue has his normal armor. Aside from it, he has a handful of NR and FR gear for raiding, as well as a few extra pieces to help mix and match his gear depending on the situation. Overall, I'd say he has 2 1/2, possibly 3 sets of gear (in terms of the amount of pieces).<br /><br />My Druid has no less than 6. We have the healing set for raids - possibly numerous pieces for the same slot. Then we have a PvP set. Additionally, we have pieces geared for tanking, DPS, casting/dmg, and hybrid gear. Not entirely full sets for all of those, but a number of pieces for those purposes. Not to mention the FR/NR gear we have to get as well. The sheer number of things we have to obtain is ridiculous.<br /><br />I know, I know . . . It comes with the territory. You know what Druids like though? We like those few pieces of gear we get that are ACTUALLY effective hybrid pieces. This is one of those few items. Call me greedy if you will, but it'd be nice to finally not to have to carry around half a bag full of various weapons for a situation I may or may not encounter at that time. But hey, Priest need their 1h DPS Maces, right!<br /><br />p.s. With Patch 2.0, all aspects of the Druid got a major boost, making this weapon even more effect for all their forms.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah the bottom part of the weapons EQUIP: List pretty much says a priest can NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER roll on this UNLESS... EVERY druid in the raid has one (haha) OR some druid may be retarded enough to actually pass on this (only a druid who is resto only and has GM/HWL mace would do that, I should think)... 360 atk power in forms? Heh, they may as well add the word druid to the weapons text and not even ALLOW anyone else to even wield it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As previous people have said before, this IS a druid priority weapon.<br /><br />If you compare it to the Blessed Qiraji Augur Staff, the equips are practically the same.<br /><br />The End of Dreams<br />Binds when picked up<br />Unique<br />One-Hand	Mace<br />44 - 120 Damage	Speed 1.90<br />(43.2 damage per second)<br />+18 Intellect<br />+18 Stamina<br />Requires Level 60<br />Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 95. <br />Equip: +305 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear forms only. <br />Equip: Restores 7 mana per 5 sec. <br /><br />combined with <br />Sartura's Might<br />Binds when picked up<br />Held In Hand	Miscellaneous<br />+6 Intellect<br />+6 Stamina<br />Requires Level 60<br />Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 51. <br />Equip: Restores 5 mana per 5 sec. <br /><br />brings you to <b>146 healing and 12 MP5</b><br /><br />with <br />Blessed Qiraji Augur Staff<br />Binds when picked up<br />Unique<br />Two-Hand	Staff<br />132 - 227 Damage	Speed 3.00<br />(59.8 damage per second)<br />+24 Intellect<br />+23 Stamina<br />Requires Level 60<br /><b>Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 143. <br />Equip: Restores 15 mana per 5 sec. </b><br /><br />so if you are in line to get an Augur staff (regalia), instead of waiting through all the priests, just go for EoD, granted it is druid priority in your guild.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 24th 2006 at 7:35pm EDT by ahconfusedshoe</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I guess this is a triple bladed druid weapon. +Damage for moonkin. +Healing for resto. AP for ferals. It's nice seeing Blizzard give druids some love. They have been long overdue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Why is this not a class item only? Only druids can use the main effect of the weapon the 305 Ap in form. <br />I am so tempted to ask in my guild, once the druids no longer need this, if i can take it on my paladin, because of the high amount of spell power there is on it.<br />Aswell the 7mana per tick is a nice feature to it too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just got this, Timecop &lt;Fervor&gt; dwarf priest on crushridge, i am getting spell damage on this beast</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TriksterHD</b></h3>I've seen BiS lists saying that Shadow Priests get priority on this, even over Druids. Boomkins are better off getting Brimstone Staff and Ferals have like 5 other weapons that are considered as good as this.</div>
