BUT I FOUND A SOLUTION AND DID IT ON MY OWN. Quite proud actually :)\n\nRemember:\nRemember to have a Soul Shared to call for your VoidWalker or Imp. when the time comes.\n\n1. Climb the mountain behind the tree. When looking straight at the tree (Coord 31,31), start climbing the mountain on the far right. Try to get as high, then go to the left (Goal: Sneak behind the tree). You need to do some strategic jumping. If you succeed, you will arive just behind the tree, without being detected. Smooth!\n\n2. From where you stand now (with the mountain wall behind your back), you will see a guard on the right. You have to take him out, but first call for your Voidwalker or Imp. Make him STAY up the mountainside until you need him.\n\n3. Attack the guard with a spell, so he will come to you. Put your Voidwalker\/Imp on him. Attack him with full power (He will be lvl 20). Be sure to attack him in a way that he will not get far if he tries to run away, and in that way not call for other guards.\n\n4. Luckily no other guard has detected you. Now for the easy part.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this with a friend and he said he had to get REALLY close to it to 'open' it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Heartswood is found at 31,31 in Ashenvale, just north of Maestra's, as stated by the CosmosUI map. There were approximately 8 caster mobs, most accompanied by pets. The mobs are approximately lvl 20-22. After clearing all the mobs, I had to stand up on a branch/root thing on the front side and a little to the left before I could click to &quot;open&quot; the tree. Yes, you attack the tree to open it, I have no idea why. Anyway, best of luck. ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Myself, it took time to find this solution.<br />I knew I didn't have the chance to do all the Voidwalkers etc. on my own, then extract the Heartswood, being only lvl 22. BUT I FOUND A SOLUTION AND DID IT ON MY OWN. Quite proud actually :)<br /><br />Remember:<br />Remember to have a Soul Shared to call for your VoidWalker or Imp. when the time comes.<br /><br />1. Climb the mountain behind the tree. When looking straight at the tree (Coord 31,31), start climbing the mountain on the far right. Try to get as high, then go to the left (Goal: Sneak behind the tree). You need to do some strategic jumping. If you succeed, you will arive just behind the tree, without being detected. Smooth!<br /><br />2. From where you stand now (with the mountain wall behind your back), you will see a guard on the right. You have to take him out, but first call for your Voidwalker or Imp. Make him STAY up the mountainside until you need him.<br /><br />3. Attack the guard with a spell, so he will come to you. Put your Voidwalker/Imp on him. Attack him with full power (He will be lvl 20). Be sure to attack him in a way that he will not get far if he tries to run away, and in that way not call for other guards.<br /><br />4. Luckily no other guard has detected you. Now for the easy part. Try to mark a guard that is nearest to the tree, or someone real close. The guards around will be drawn to your VoidWalker/Imp....NOW IS YOUR CHANCE.<br /><br />5. Looking with the mountain wall behind you. Go to the right of the tree. Right click on it (Actually attacking it). Take the Heartswood.<br /><br />6 You can actually get away without anybody seing you, from where you came, or you can run as fast as possible out and try to get as far as possible before you get killed, and then resurect on a safe distance.<br /><br />Congrats...You have the Heartswood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's really easy to solo, even without dropping down from the mountains. Just go due south of the tree, and carefully pull mobs one at a time, using curse of recklessness so they don't run. Dont waste time with the ones west of the tree, only get the ones in your way. Once you clear the tree, grab your stuff and hearth out. I didn't die once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Level 21-22 is a perfect level to do this quest, its located at 31,31 and all you need to do is fight the mobs one by one, use your pet like a voidwalker to keep them at bay</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did this quest on lvl 20 without any probs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't know how you could find this hard at lvl.20. I simply killed all enforcers in a beeline, cleared a path and grabbed the item I needed. I didn't die once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this one is easie, just kill them one py one, or use fear to the pet so u can kill the caster first. the fastest way to kill them is to use DOT then ur wand. that will kill the enermy within 10 secs (u need a good wand of course)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have stood on the root to the left side and i still can not select the tree.&nbsp; Tried several times and went on various roots, etc. but still nothing to select.&nbsp; Any one else having an issue?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did this myself at 20 without going around the &quot;back way&quot; or anything; just killed the other summoners out front of the tree then went around to the side and took out the three excavators guarding it.&nbsp; All of them are blood elves and are therefore, apparently, immune to fear, which was fine.&nbsp; I think, though, that the Heartswood Tree isn't the huge one but rather the small one off to the side of it; you can't hack at it from the one side which is why I think that's the case.&nbsp; Either Blizzard made the wrong tree the target or there's some other gltich but that's what I think the deal is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you all made this sound way to hard, i had to kill 3-4 lvl 19-20 mobs and stand directly infront of the tree, wack it, and walk away. took me about 3 mins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone said the heartswood tree was north west. It's not it's north east. I spent about an hour on the beach looking for the tree.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is piss easy at lvl 21, soloed it with my voidwalker, just killed the guards and took the item, np, no deaths</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is easy, I was lv 20 and did it my self. If you kill to locks between the big tree and the heatswood you can kill all the guys around the tree and grap your item</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>at level 22 - I stayed on the right side very close to the mountain and killed the mobs one by one - killing the pets first and the master then.<br /><br />To get the heartswood, the easiest is to get behind the tree and right-click on the root (somewhat lighter brown color) rather than the tree itself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just a big heads up,&nbsp; i was a little confused.<br /><br />its a lil bush around the big tree.<br /><br />run around the tree until the gear goes solid grey.&nbsp; i thought i had to run up to the platform to get this.&nbsp; not the case.<br /><br />not hard,&nbsp; 23 warlock.<br /><br />zb.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>thanks to all the comments I would have struggled on this one without them.<br /><br />I did this with a good lvl20 warlock (Belinda)<br />She's got lots of good quality armour with loads of extras and with careful pulling managed it fairly quickly.<br /><br />Thanks for all your comments which has saved me hours (according to some of you!)<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing my own sexy sucumbusthingy !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found it at 31,31</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Rofl I killed like 3-4 mobs and (used) hit the three and completed. Healthstone to SW ftw</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is a piece of cake. I solo'd it at level 21.<br /><br />Just pull one mob at a time, then go get the tree. Don't run in and aggro all 6234328 mobs guarding it at once.<br /><br />The hardest part of the whole quest for me was getting to the coordinates I got from Thottbot. I fell off a really high cliff and died behind a tree and couldn't get to my corpse until I ran all the way back up the cliff and fell down to my corpse.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This was a very easy quest after about 30 mins of running around trying to find the ruins. I only had to kill 3-4 mobs loot the heartwood and hearth.&nbsp; the ruins are north east of the outpost.&nbsp; They will show up on the map after you discover the outpost.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this was easy, all i did was kill one mob and the VW and then i &quot;attacked&quot; the tree from like a mile off. <br /><br />all you have to do is stick to the wall kill one mob and your close enough to get it. no ieda why you guys say you have to be close to it, you dont.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All you have to do is<br /><br />1.Have your VW out<br />2.Make sure that you have SS and HealthStone<br />3.Sneak as far as you can toward the tree<br />4.when they start to attack, use VW sacrifice (you will die)<br />5.Rez with SS<br />6.There will be only 1 that attacks you kill him<br />7.loot the tree</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>BUT WHERE IS THE TREE<br />i get how to do it but where is it? i dont have coorddinates can anyone pls help me out?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This was one of the easiest quests I've ever done. <br /><br />31,31 = THE TREE<br /><br />Head straight for the tree and kill 2 mobs, 1 VW 1 Lock each. <br /><br />There was even a chest by the tree to make this quest even better.<br /><br />Like the others said, if this quest is hard for you, re-roll, or just stop playing all together.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>31,31 in ashenvale, a tree called Heartswood</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you come from astanaar don't take the first path north. if you discovert maestra post it's te lowest ruine (it take a few seconds to loot it so don't run in it and take it)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 25th 2006 at 11:40am EDT by Moniak</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Level 20 lock + vw. The melee mobs around the tree are single pulls. Just tab each with a curse, put the vw on it, kill as usual.</div>

Logged him out, brought my Warlock back in....strolled over to the Heartswood.<br /><br />Cheating? Nope....it was as if I had a lvl 44 hunter grouped with me. ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The distance away from the tree you can be and still get the item is so awesome, makes up for having to go thorugh barrens D=</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lawpriest</b></h3>Everyone puts coordinates to find stuff, but most of us don't have that. Anyone putting information about finding things need to make it so anyone can read it and find what they're looking for.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Omanom</b></h3><b>Where is it!</b><br />In Ashenvale there is a place called Maestra's Post. Maestra's Post is south of the Darkshore/Ashenvale border. If you head directly North East of Maestra's Post you'll find a small structure on the map (looks like two pylons with a tiny rope between them), this is <i>The Ruins of Ordil'Aran</i>. In that area you will find a tree you can interact with called &quot;Heartswood&quot;.</div>
