<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hey, i'm a rogue engineer.&nbsp; most of the stuff i make is only usable by me.<br /><br />this appears to be something that blacksmiths can make.&nbsp; the question:&nbsp; can a non-blacksmith use this item?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yea i recently found this plan in a chest in Sm in the grave yard and not knowing how rare it was auctioned it off, but luckily i had no buy out on the item but only got about 19 gold from it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I heard a rumor that you can apply this to your offhand weapon, and it still makes it impossible for your main hand to be disarmed.&nbsp; Can anyone confirm or deny this please?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got one from a guild mate, he said it wouldn't work on offhand. So i got it on main hand weapon.<br /><br />Later I tested it with a warrior, he couldn't disarm me when I held the chained weapon in offhand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've seen the price of the recipe go up to 150g on eredar since the recipes are so rare, i want the recipe so badly but i can't afford that much : /</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got it yesterday in Uldaman (server=Runetotem), in one of the chambers not too far away from the Temple of Doom room. It was dropped by a non-boss opponent.<br /><br />None in the party I was in had ever heard of this recepi, so the excitement was high. Luckily for me, I was the only BS in the party, so it went to me (in return of a solid promise to make chains for all the other party-members).<br /><br />Even tough the selling-price (recepi) on AH is high, I believe it is better to learn it, and sell the chains in AH afterwards. It has to be said though, that you have to be BS (190) to put them on. Or know someone who is BS (190) who will do it for you!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If a warrior fights vs other warrior the first thing to do is disarm, what is a very stupid and strong spell but finally i discovered this chain, its very cool to kik ass vs humans warriors and for pvp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hehe...i know it's been said a dozen times in this thread but i figured i'd say it again just incase there was any question.<br /><br />Bought one in AH and had a RL friend that does blacksmithing throw it on one of my weapons.&nbsp; He didn't think that the effect would work in the off-hand. So i equiped it in off-hand and we dueled (i'm 47, he's a 60 warrior)<br /><br />IMMUNE<br />IMMUNE<br />IMMUNE<br /><br />/waves bye-bye to being disarmed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes if you attach the Chain to your offhand the effect still carries on through to your main hand. only your main hand can be disarmed.<br /><br />I am alliance on Firetree making these for 6g a pop. Friend got the plans drop in Uldaman and gave to me because i am a blacksmih, only he didnt know how much the plans go for.<br />username is &quot;Bonesrob&quot; Firetree-Alliance<br />This is one of the most useful attachments to put on your weapon!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On Garathos, horde, i've seen this in AH twice for over 300 gold.&nbsp; Otherwise i've not seen it for sale and pretty much, since i want it, will have to go find it.&nbsp; I'm not paying that much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got the plans off the AH for 25g. I've only seen them before for over 100g so I'm assuming that someone didnt know what they were worth. Well, good for me, bad for them.<br /><br />Whisp me or send me some mail if you are interested in buying one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>for warriors the chain is not needed if you use the arms tree of your talents. theres a talent where you can become immune and still get enchants on your weapons.<br /><br />And where is the best place for this to drop?<br />ive never seen the plans and would love to learn it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A Drywhisker Kobold just East of Hammerfal dropped it. thank god I came on here to check what the market value is for one of these things!<br /><br />horde:zuluhed server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Would such an item override a preexisting BSmith work like Iron Counterweight? Or is a better plan to attach the chains to 1h weapons and keep Counterweights on 2hs?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can make these on server frostwhisper, horde side. Whisper me in game if ou want to buy one, or email me on christiand92@hotmail.com.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Notice the item says it Requires Blacksmithing. Any BS with 190+ skill can apply this to any weapon via the Trade Window. It can be be added to others peoples equipment the same way an Enchanter would apply enchants to an item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I do know that it will overide any enchants that you have on the weapon, so I assume it would do the same for counterweight. I have the chain on 2 of my weapons and I can tell you that it's worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Good question, Lord Korgull, and one that I'd like an answer to also, if anyone reading this knows...<br /><br />Or is the chain and counterweight like enchantments and armor kits, for instance, and you may only have one or the other on any one given item?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>it can't exist with a counterweight</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if you place a steel weapon chain on EITHER main or off hand , or on a 2 handed weapon, you will be IMMUNE to disarm by either NPC or player in PVP on any weapons you are currently equipping.<br /><br />eg:<br />julies dagger off hand with barman shanker weapon damage...it is impossible for me to be disarmed by anything in the game.<br /><br />it will replace any other enchantments you have on the weapon, such as weapon damage, beastslaying...etc.<br />BUT,<br />you can still add poison, sharpening stones , etc as these are not enchantments.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just picked the plan up on Drendan server AH for 1g50s, are these things still usable?</div>
