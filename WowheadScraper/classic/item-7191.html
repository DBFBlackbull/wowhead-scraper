I made the simple target dummies, and tried several locations and techniques to increase the loot rate of fused wiring. Finally, I thought I had the best way: In Westfall, the northern murloc camp at the coast. If I collected 3 or 4 of the murlocs, dropped a Target dummy and ran away, I got a fused wiring pretty often, I thought. \n\nMy boyfriend did not belive in this strategy, and said that it was just coincidence. We dropped target dummies everywhere, and the droprate was similar. So the term \"Murloc theory\" was born, and sneaked into the language of our family. So if someone makes a statement now about a correlation based on guesses, small amount of repetitions or plain gut feeling, it is very fast revealed as a \"Murloc theory\"! And it has also made our kids more aware of that not everything is as it seems :-)\n\nHere are some of my favorite Murloc theories (rejected) about Fused wiring drop rates:\n\n1. The drop rate is best if the level of the beasts killing the dummy is slightly lower than the dummy level. If they are too high level, the dummy is smashed so hard that the wiring is destroyed.\n\n2. Newly made, \"fresh\" dummies have a better drop rate than old dummies. This can be because the wiring is stuck in old dummies by rust etc.\n\n3. The drop rate increases if someone else made the dummies, eg. Blizzard want to stimulate cooperation.\n\n4. The drop rate increases with the skill of the engineer making them. Skilled engineers are better at making dummies than low lvls.\n\n5. The drop rate is better close to large cities, and especially near AH and anvils. Maybe because it is there they are going to be used afterwards (but that could also be because they are fresh, see theory 2....)\n\n6. And, the original one: Dummies killed by murlocs, and especially those north in Westfall, gives more fused wiring than usual (but that can also be because they are closest to Stormwind, see theory 5....)\n\n--------------\nBut the final conclusion are: The drop rate of fused wiring is about 1:7, it is like rolling a dice with 7 surfaces, and it doesn't matter where you are and if someone hits the dummies. Make a stack of target dummies and go fishing, cook food or melt copper and fire a dummy whenever they are ready.\n\nGood luck!\n\n[i]El�nil, Head of Murloc Science Department[\/i]\n\nPS: These forums are flooded with \"murloc theories\", so don't belive everything you read! :D","date":"2006-09-12T05:09:47-05:00","rating":103,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Just remember one thing:\nIf you roll a seven-sided dice you wont roll a seven every seventh time.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've gotten this from the regualr and advanced target dummy. Just make a bunch of them, plant them somewhere (even in town) and wait a few minutes 'til they expire. Then loot their &quot;corpse.&quot; <br /><br />But even off of target dummies they don't drop often. But it's safer and faster than running around Gnomeregan.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So I read all of the messages on here and decided to give it a go...<br /><br />I bought all the materials required and made 20 Advanced Target Dummies.<br /><br />I used them all and had enough parts to make another 9 (minus 10 leather which I bought too). Used the 9 and had enough parts to make another 3 and after using those 3 I had enough parts to make another 2.<br /><br />so... after spending 11g and watching 34 dummies explode, I have:<br /><br />7 Fused Wiring<br />2 Heavy Leather<br />6 Bronze Framework<br />6 Iron Strut</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got one from my exploded rocketboots,<br />yet another advantage over gnomish engineering hehe<br />I'm curious about future explosions</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>came to thottbot to figure out where im gonna find a fused wiring, and after doing some searching here i tried the 1 option i read about &quot;make a compact harvest reaper and loot it after it goes up in smoke&quot; it netted me 2 iron struts 3 heavy leather and 1 fused wiring. First try!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found a fused wiring in Gnomeregan. It was a grime-encrusted object, which I washed.<br />I knew how rare they are (my server is Shadowsong) and I made 5g on it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here's an idea.&nbsp; Instead of blowing 5G a pop on these stupid items, do this: buy a ton of gold power cores on AH for cheap(got 20 for 1G), build target dummies and harvest reapers, and let them get killed.&nbsp; Then salvage parts and you should get fused wiring quite often.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>DONT buy, DONT grind Shredders in STV, DONT grind Arcane Nullifiers in Gnomeregan! Just grind Deadmines a LOT of times.... u get all the mats there for target dummies... Copper, Tin, Linen and Wool u can easily get in Deadmines and in the Goblin Foundry u can make all the target dummies u want. Then at VanCleef or another boss use them so they get killed and u dont have to w8 like 3 minutes. Also, the green items from Deadmines earn quite good too :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can confirm they still drop off Advanced Target Dummies. Got 1 off the first one I used.<br /><br />Used it in Silithus btw.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had never bothered worrying about these until I got the plans for Goblin Jumper Cables, I took the materials I had in the bank and made 12 of the lowest level target dummies hoping to get one fused wiring. I got the one I needed and five more by the time I dropped them all and the ones I made from the materials they dropped, probably 24 or so dummies total, guess I was lucky. Waiting for them to get to my Auction House character in mail now. Checked them out when I was starting this and there was one up for 3g bid no buyout, and stack of two for 7-14g, this is on the Steamwheedle Cartel RP server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First time i ever got one of these it droped from a target dummy but i sold it to a vendor as I stupidly thought it was a usless item! Then 2 levels later i get the plans for the dragon trinket look up fused wiring on AH and there was 1 going for 8 g..... :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I made 33 Target Dummies to level my engineering skills, these were my drops<br /><br />22 Linen<br />1 Wool<br />29 Copper Bolts<br />18 Bronze Bars<br />11 Copper Modulators<br />10 Fused Wiring</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just bought a stack of 5 of these for 15s and then another stack of 2 for 30s<br /><br />So basically got about 70g worth of items for 45s o.0</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I made 16 advanced target dummies, and got about 5 fused wiring from them.<br /><br />As well as the wiring, I would get more materials to make more dummies.<br /><br />Instead of trying to farm them somewhere I think that's the best route to go. <br /><br />Build advanced target dummies (I just stayed in town, set them up and waited the 15 seconds for them to expire to loot them)<br /><br />Used a few, sold the rest for close to 10g each.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just thought I'd add my 2-cents. I think Fused Wiring is the best/easiest money maker if you are patient. AND helps you level quicker!<br />(results may vary)<br /><br />1 - Take an Alt and lvl him quickly to 85 Engineering, and learn Target Dummies.<br /><br />2 - 'Home' him in Thunder Bluff. (Bank, AH, Anvil are all close)<br /><br />3 - Have your Main (or Mid-High lvl Alt you are running at the time) supply him with about 10g.<br /><br />4 - All this Alt does is buy Copper Bars, Linen Cloth and Wool Cloth in Bulk. Look for good prices! Have the Alt make STACKS of Target Dummies. (10 per stack).<br /><br />5 - Send the TDs to the charater you're running the most. USE THEM! For me as a hunter this gives me easy acces to mobs 3 to 4 lvls above me because I can balance the Threat with my Pet/Target Dummy.<br /><br />6 - I get fused wiring about 1 every 4 to 5 dummies. Sometimes better, sometimes worse.<br /><br />7 - Once I get a stack of 5 I either send them back to my Alt in TB, or I put them up myself depending on where I am at. <br /><br />Notes:&nbsp; Save your wool cloth. I can justify buying the copper bars every time, wool cloth can get expensive, but is easy to farm.&nbsp; Also, I am not greedy. I find that if I use the Trade channel and sell 5x stack for 20g (which is usually well under the AH price) that I never have to wait more than 1 minute for reply. My 2 cents, but it's a system that works well for me! Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As an engineer, I was short of fused wiring all the time. I made the simple target dummies, and tried several locations and techniques to increase the loot rate of fused wiring. Finally, I thought I had the best way: In Westfall, the northern murloc camp at the coast. If I collected 3 or 4 of the murlocs, dropped a Target dummy and ran away, I got a fused wiring pretty often, I thought. <br /><br />My boyfriend did not belive in this strategy, and said that it was just coincidence. We dropped target dummies everywhere, and the droprate was similar. So the term &quot;Murloc theory&quot; was born, and sneaked into the language of our family. So if someone makes a statement now about a correlation based on guesses, small amount of repetitions or plain gut feeling, it is very fast revealed as a &quot;Murloc theory&quot;! And it has also made our kids more aware of that not everything is as it seems :-)<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite Murloc theories (rejected) about Fused wiring drop rates:<br /><br />1. The drop rate is best if the level of the beasts killing the dummy is slightly lower than the dummy level. If they are too high level, the dummy is smashed so hard that the wiring is destroyed.<br /><br />2. Newly made, &quot;fresh&quot; dummies have a better drop rate than old dummies. This can be because the wiring is stuck in old dummies by rust etc.<br /><br />3. The drop rate increases if someone else made the dummies, eg. Blizzard want to stimulate cooperation.<br /><br />4. The drop rate increases with the skill of the engineer making them. Skilled engineers are better at making dummies than low lvls.<br /><br />5. The drop rate is better close to large cities, and especially near AH and anvils. Maybe because it is there they are going to be used afterwards (but that could also be because they are fresh, see theory 2....)<br /><br />6. And, the original one: Dummies killed by murlocs, and especially those north in Westfall, gives more fused wiring than usual (but that can also be because they are closest to Stormwind, see theory 5....)<br /><br />--------------<br />But the final conclusion are: The drop rate of fused wiring is about 1:7, it is like rolling a dice with 7 surfaces, and it doesn't matter where you are and if someone hits the dummies. Make a stack of target dummies and go fishing, cook food or melt copper and fire a dummy whenever they are ready.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br /><i>El�nil, Head of Murloc Science Department</i><br /><br />PS: These forums are flooded with &quot;murloc theories&quot;, so don't belive everything you read! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To get fused wires, I just carry around some <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15910">masterwork target dummies</a> . Anytime that I agro to many monsters, I just throw one down. It helps me survive a fight, and it drops a fused wiring. I haven't kept track of how many I've used, but it's more than a dozen, and every single one has dropped one. Maybe I'm just lucky, I don't know. Masterwork target dummies are pretty expensive, but selling the fused wirings, or at least not having to buy one if I need one, offsets the cost. Fused wiring are used in making <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=39126">Field repair bots</a> which come in handy, and explode after one use, so, you will need a lot of fused wiring if you plan on raiding.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you ppl say that it drops more off the advanced target dummies but realy it has the same chance as a basic one. ok so instead of paying mad gold to make the advanced ones just pay the same ammount of gold to make about 10 times more basic dummies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>They should make fused wiring stackable, takes up too much space in the bank and they're not something you'd throw away or sell just to make space.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just did a quick test. Made 10 advanced and 10 regular target dummies. After recycling parts I ended up with 5 more of each. So, out of 15 of each, I got 3 fused from the advanced, and 5 from the regular. That's a pretty small sample, but it shows that they have roughly the same drop rate. Since the mats for regular are about 1/3 the price (50s and 1g50 on Elune), that's the way to go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Venture Co.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have recently made the discovery that having very high level mobs smack an Advanced Target Dummy greatly increases the drop rate on fused wiring.<br />My usually drop from the advanced dummies is about 1 in 8.<br />If I have a ZG or AQ20 mob smack one, their drop rate has been about 66% (2 out of 3) for me. Note that it has to get hit by the mob to get the increase. Most of the time throwing by a running snake in ZG will get a hit, but the guaranteed method is to put it right next to a rooted or frost nova'd mob, then they definitely get hit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK - as of 1.10 to farm fused wiring (obviously for repair bots mainly but used in other engineering recipes) just make advanced target dummies, and deploy them. In one hours time I get 7-8 of them. Not only that, but the target dummies also drop the pieces needed to make more advanced target dummies, so I just stand by the anvil and deploy, loot, create. The only thing it never seems to drop much of is heavy leather - bring 2 extra stacks with you and you should be fine. I got bored one day while waiting for bwl and stood there doing that all day, spent about 15g in parts, harvested over 50 fused wiring and made about 250g ove the next week slowly listing it in the ah.</div>
