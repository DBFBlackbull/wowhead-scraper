It would probably be more worth your time to just check the AH and buy him there or wait until you happen to see Timmy wandering around.","date":"2006-11-07T13:25:38-06:00","rating":18,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":3,"id":45066,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Appie","body":"WTB this at xavius EU (I'm horde) pay good contact me. marlonbenjamins@hotmail.com","date":"2007-03-02T10:29:35-06:00","rating":-3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":4,"id":45901,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Aerowix","body":"[small][s]Lil Timmy's route in Stormwind might help\nhttp:\/\/img300.imageshack.us\/img300\/4262\/littletimmy8hf.jpg[\/s][\/small]\nAbove link has expired, please view the npc page for Lil Timmy's route.","date":"2007-03-04T06:41:35-06:00","rating":60,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2015-07-06T14:31:08-05:00",3,"Aerowix"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":65393,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"39668","body":"I found it in the Neutral AH for 5 gold.

Definately worth any price on the Auction House. Though, I was especially lucky to find it for only 6g on the Neutral Auction House as a Hordie.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5783</b></h3>For an Ally, it's easy to camp Timmy's spawn spot and buy it cheap. My experience on the Horde side shows that it's best to ask through IRC or realm forums for someone to put it in the neutral AH for you. Otherwise you may wait really long before this pretty cat shows up and then the price can still be very high.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5016</b></h3>Timmy spawns in Stormwind near the bridge between the Trade District and Old Town. His spawn timer is very long so if you are camping his spawn point be prepared to sit there for hours on end. If you are frequently in Stormwind you will probably run into Timmy every now and then. If you are an ally then you can usually find the kitten on the Alliance AH fairly cheap. It would probably be more worth your time to just check the AH and buy him there or wait until you happen to see Timmy wandering around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>39668</b></h3>I found it in the Neutral AH for 5 gold. Selling this pets in the Neutral AH could be an easy way to make golds since their price at vendors is 40 silvers. Unluckily they are cute but useless and not so many people would spend 5g for them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nahri</b></h3>Ive sold about 10 of these to horde through the neutral ah and some even to alliance for 5g. <br /><br />1. Someone is always lazy enough to pay it<br />2. They are cute.<br />3. Lots of pet collectors in the game buying them up</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rover</b></h3>this is a pretie cool pet. what makes it even cooler is that it scalled a kitten right.................well its acually smaller than the real average pet cat. like it should be. its about half the size smaller. its really cool. now im a pet collector and im not buying this 1 up. but then again i also only collect 1 form each kind not every pet ion the game. i think its cheaper and funner to do it the way im doing it!!!! its really fun to collect pets i think you guys should too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found him at 1:45 AM at the bridge between trade district and old town. He walks along the canal around the old town, over the bridge to the dwarven district. Again along the canal to the cathedral district, where he takes the southern route around the orphanage. When he leaves the cathedral district on the opposite side, he turns right and walks again in the canal district until he hits the wall und despawns.</div>
