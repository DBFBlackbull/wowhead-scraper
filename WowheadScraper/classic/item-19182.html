<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those that are trying to get 1200 tickets with no profession, you can only turn in 125 vibrant plumes.&nbsp; After that you cant do the tier 4 quest anymore except for tier 5. Then its off to grinding 450 evil bat eyes or glowing scorpid blood.<br /><br />25 turn-ins * 12 tickets = 300 tickets<br />25 turn-ins * 5 vplumes&nbsp; = 125 vplumes = 300tickets<br /><br />900 tickets left<br /><br />900 tickets / 20 tickets = 45 turn-ins<br />45 turn-ins * 10 eyes for 20 tickets = 450 eyes<br /><br />Is it worth it?&nbsp; Thats for you to decide.&nbsp; All professions should get a chance of getting the epics.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can't figure out how to pick a fight with the Darkmoon Faire guys. I knew you couldn't:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * attack them direct,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * toggle &quot;at war&quot; then attack<br /><br />Thinking about what happens in Booty Bay and Gadget, I hoped I could:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * duel a horde, and get DMF to defend<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Attack a flagged horde and get DMF to defend<br /><br />But trying all of the above in Mulgore did nothing. So nothing I can think of works to get Darkmoon Faire npcs to attack me.&nbsp; If someone knows a way to reduce Darkmoon Faire rep, please let me know.<br /><br />BTW: I think a DMF npc attacked someone one time while I was in Goldshire. I was low level at the time and didn't take much notice, plus that was several patches ago so it doesn't mean much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So if i have one char with herb / alch and i would like to give thorium widgets from my other char to one with herb/alch can he turn thorium widgets still in to get tickets?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My level 60 Miner / Goblin Engineer just got 200 tickets from Rugged Armor Kit turnins, I don't know if there was a tweak, but I'm able to do all the turnins.&nbsp; Except the low-reputation ones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I want to save up 1200 tickets for the Amulet. If I don't get all 1200 tickets for the current faire, will the tickets carryover till the next faire, or do they expire with each month's faire?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't see the 'Steam Tonk' controller pattern for 40 tickets. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=54308">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=54308</a><br /><br />So is this pattern purchase out right as it's own Prize (meaning this database is missing it), or is it a random prize from the RANDOM draw of 40 tickets (which seems wasteful)...anyone?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So you exchange items for tickets that give you reputation with Dark Faire, what benefits do you get for having a high reputation with them?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't see a lot of point in working for weeks to get enough tickets for the Amulet or the Orb, but I have had a lot of luck with the Greater Darkmoon Prizes. Got Soulkeeper once (worth 50g at AH), armor that would have sold for over 20g if my alt didn't beg me for it, and other great items.<br /><br />If I was a rogue, I'd do most anything to get that Amulet, amazing stats for a rogue but there's nothing very good for priests.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>45 Tickets seem enough for me. One Flower and a Greater Darkmoon Prize - just to try it. The rest is junk... There is nothing of value at the Darkmoon Faire besides those 4 Darkmoon Card. And I'm to low to use them or to hunt for those Cards...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If anyone knows, how do you get 1200 tickets? Do you just farm the materials and when the fair comes, turn in a buttload? Also, when and for how long does the fair come into town for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, the newly un-nerfed Amulet looks pretty nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The reputation gained for each quest has gone up to 250, limiting the number of times you can do the lower level turn-ins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>FARMING: <br />5 small furry paws = 8 tickets, 500 neutral. <br />5 torn bear pelts = 8 tickets, 1100 neutral. <br />5 soft bushy tails = 8 tickets, 1700 neutral. <br />5 vibrant plumes = 12 tickets, 2500 neutral. <br />10 glowing scorpid blood = 20 tickets, unlimited. <br />10 evil bat eyes = 20 tickets, unlimited. <br /><br />CRAFTING: <br />Engineering(5) <br />5 copper modulators = 1 ticket, 500 neutral. <br />7 whirring bronze gizmos = 4 tickets, 1100 neutral. <br />36 green fireworks = 8 tickets, 1700 neutral. <br />6 mechanical repair kits = 12 tickets, 2500 neutral. <br />6 thorium widgets = 20 tickets, unlimited. <br /><br />Blacksmithing(5) <br />10 coarse weightstones = 1 ticket, 500 neutral. <br />7 heavy grinding stones = 4 tickets, 1100 neutral. <br />3 green iron bracers = 8 tickets, 1700 neutral. <br />1 big black mace = 12 tickets, 2500 neutral. <br />8 dense grinding stones = 20 tickets, unlimited. <br /><br />Leatherworking(5) <br />3 embossed leather boots = 1 ticket, 500 neutral. <br />3 toughened leather armor = 4 tickets, 1100 neutral. <br />1 turtle scale legging = 12 tickets, ? neutral. (this one is unconfirmed) <br />3 barbaric harness's = 8 tickets, 2500 neutral. <br />8 rugged armor kits = 20 tickets, unlimited.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For Carnival Boots, or Jerkins, or the other one's that don't have a &quot;more&quot; quest, can you turn in multiple times to get more tickets, or is it a one time shot? Some of those are a better bang for the buck, and easier than farming just for Rugged leather.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is to do 360 thorium widgets and 120 runecloth. Have an engineering friend make them for you for cheap or for free. Should not cost more than 201 gold if you buy the mats right or farm for them yourself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>save save save</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just do 320 thorium widgets with engineering :P<br />u just need like 960 thorium bars and 320 runecloth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>when the faire leaves town you can still use the tickets for next time.. or if you go to mulgore.. just save up.. and you have enough for the big stuff :) or if there gets more valuable stuff.. hope a weapon would come in some patch soon xD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me about 3 months to get enough rugged leather for armor kits. Atm I've got 136 rugged armor kits in my bank, a beasts deck, and 840 darkmoon tickets, waiting for the next faire. Got tired of farming leather a couple of days ago so bought the last 300 leather.<br /><br />1200 tickets<br />60 turnins<br />480 rugged armor kits<br />2400 rugged leather</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i have 45 tickets at the moment. i got mine from 1 paw run 2 plume runs and 1 bat eye run... it took me ALL DAY, how do people get like 1400?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hirokumata</b></h3>is there any addon that tracks item of consequence for quests to obtain these tickets?<br />so you dont dispose of them by mistake</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moonstaker</b></h3>In Season of Discovery, the turn ins for Darkmoon Faire seem have changed, due to the much lower (at current) level cap and removal of max level loot-tables rendering the higher level turn ins unobtainable.<br /><br />100 Points off of Friendly, and I am still able to turn in the base level items for tickets, which would normally turn off around 1.2k-1.5k Neutral.</div>
