<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know what the recycle time is for these recipes?&nbsp; I'm tired of people putting these on AH for nearly triple the price.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where is this '' Leatherworker '' that sell's this recipe? is he the horde?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sometimes its just the number of people farmin the area (Swamp of Sorrows), but the recycle rate is about 30-45 minutes as my guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i'm alliance and he was green to me , and all the other humanoids around him were in yellow</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>is it from a alliance dude ore horde?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This NPC is friendly to both Horde and Alliance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can't say about restock rates but I went there and he didn't have the pattern. I ran around the swamp and came back and he didn't have it. I went back to Stonard and just checked out the camp, went back and he didn't have the pattern. Then I ran back and forth between Stonard and the Harborage to find a good path because I expected to be back often until I got the pattern. On my 5th visit to the vendor, the last one for the night, he had the pattern. Altogether I was in Swamp of Sorrows for about 25 minutes. I guess I was lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He is at 26,31</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got there and he had the pattern on the first try, lucky for me, no one ever goes to Swamp of Sorrows on my server :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just got mine at 4:00 central time. i bought 2 off him and plan on useing one and selling the other.<br /><br />Alleria</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I have been waiting for well over an hour.<br /><br />If anyone on my server has it, I will pay you!<br /><br />Please!<br /><br />Server: Akama<br />Horde<br />name: Kutyo</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>is it still there after the patch?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was there today and i bought after waiting for 10 min.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>Where can I buy this pattern?</b><br />Masat T'andr, a draenei, sells this pattern. He is located at 26,31. Either get Titan or cosmos, otherwise &quot;26,31&quot; will mean very little to you. At this time you can get TitanPanel from <a href="https://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php" rel="nofollow">www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php</a> and you can get Cosmos from <a href="http://www.cosmosui.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmosui.org/</a> For those purists out there: 1,1 is the top left of your map, 100,100 is the bottom right of your map, and 50,50 is the exact center of your map.<br /><b>I am playing as the horde. Can the alliance buy this?</b><br />The vendor isn't PvP so I think the horde and the alliance can buy this pattern. At this time he does not have any guards so anyone should be able to walk up to him and interact with him without being attacked.<br /><b>How often does this pattern restock/respawn?</b><br />It seems this pattern restocks/respawns once 30 minutes to a hour based on when it was last bought.<br /><b>Does Masat T'andr sell anything else?</b><br />He sells a bunch of leatherworking and tailoring supplies that you can get from any tailoring supplier. He also sells a Brilliant Red Cloak ( <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14999">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14999</a>) and a Well Oiled Cloak (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1032/tablet-of-agitating-totem">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1032/tablet-of-agitating-totem</a>). If you are willing to do some PvP until you are a Sergeant, you can get Sergeant's Cape ( <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=39966">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=39966</a>). I would prefer to have the Sergeant's Cape instead of what he sells. I don't remember what the equivelent cape is for the horde.<br /><b>Why aren't you using the right tags for the links and urls to stuff?</b><br />You should thank thotbott's stupidity for that. Thotbott would try to redirect any link I put in this post when I tried to use a tag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you have alts, just leave one with the mob selling the pattern and while you play other chars, check back a few times by logging with the char u got there... i actually checked, no pattern, got on thottbot for something 5 min later checked again, there it was...<br /><br />gl</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I first found the pattern on my initial trip, but didn�t have the money to buy it with my alt and had to quickly hearth to Duskwoods �the closest mailbox�. Needless to say it was sold by the time I made my short trip back, but one thing I did notice in the periodic check ups that I made to the vendor there after is that he would stop selling limited items �the 2 capes he had� even before a buyer would purchase them, which gave new rise toward the thought that no one might ever have purchased the pattern before me and the vendors only really play a waiting game with their sales.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can annyone pleace tell where this is... ive been in stonard and the harborage but can find anny leatherworking spuplier! :'(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The worst thing about camping this vendor is the insults you have to listen to while waiting.&nbsp; I was really tempted to kill that Draenei guard just to get some peace!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is one of those items that is WORTH paying double/triple for (in this case, up to 10G) for this for several reasons:<br />1)If youre not high enough level to deal with the ONE Location this is sold at. (Even moreso if youre on a PvP server and have to deal with the frequent high level Alliance/Horde traffic in the contested area).<br />2)The spawn time is a pain in the butt, so if its 10G or less just get it from the AH if you see it. Otherwise you could be in for a long wait, leaving you to deal with #1 again, or even worse when there are other people camping the vendor waiting for the pattern to respawn. Especially if its members of the opposite faction, oh joy, wasted trip and death, yum.<br />3)Most Important: Time is Money--why waste the time and money travelling if its below 10G? I will always buy something from the AH if the price isnt TOO greedy. Ive seen people post this for like 50G and THAT is too much--and too greedy so I go get it myself. But if you see this for around 10G? Dont bother taking the trip and run into the crap I just did, just buyout and be done with it, with none of the hassles!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I picked this up at the vendor the first time, without having to do the quest. plus I was a LVL 47.<br /> maybe I got lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Confirmed...just a rare spawn...anyone have any idea as to the spawn time?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hmmm, I had this pattern dropping in Un'goro. Do not remember from what...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>spent a few hours checking every 15 mins... thanks wow yet anotehr pointless timesink</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>to buy this item u have to complete the quest give by anouther npc within the village not sure of his name magtug or something but after u complete the quest the item apears in the store and u can only buy 1 8( so much for anouther get rich quick plan.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Immediately after turning in the quest to collect the Draenethyst crystals, I went to Masat to sell my junk loot and saw he had this pattern, when he did not before.<br /><br />However, seeing as he only has one at a time, you probably have to firstly complete the quest and then catch him at a time when someone hasn't recently bought him out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>FYI: This information is incorrect. 1) I'm not high enough level at 49 or 2) It was changed at some point in time. Either way, don't waste your time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well i got it off of dragonkin i beleve in swamp of sorrows so i guess it can be droped :P good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well i see alot of folks with good ideas about how to obtain the recipe but i just whent to the vendor as a level 58 and atempted to buy it. He didnt have it for sale so i did the quest for Magtoor and still no luck. I then managed to park a level 20 there for a day and a half and sure enough there it was. I then attempted to return with my main and it was gone. This tells us that it is just a rare spawn and first come first serve. <br /><br />Edited, Tue Feb 14 12:29:04 2006</div>
