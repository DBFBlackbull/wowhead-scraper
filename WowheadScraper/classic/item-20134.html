You have to clear out Rattlegore's room out to start the quest. Best place to have the party is the corner directly to the right once you enter the basement.\n\nThere are three different kind of Spirit colors that spawn out.\n\nBlues - Easy mobs. AoE the first 10ish that spawn, then a named comes out to the party. After that, you can take your time and drink\/eat for a few rounds until another named comes out solo. You can Earthshock the curse, which if it lands curses you increase damage against you by 90.\n\nGreens - Drop a Disease Cleanse totem, the ghosts spam a disease that lowers your Stam by 102 I believe it was. Pull the corner near the gates first, making sure you don't aggro the center mobs. Then pull the center, then the last corner. A named comes out after the pulls.\n\nPurples - Grounding ground grounding. And focus fire. You have about five seconds until they start aggroing you, so staying in the corner won't help as much. Try to keep one shackled until you have everything under control, and keep throwing Grounding totems down, as the shadow bolts hurt. They keep spawning every so often until the Deathknight fight.\n\nDeathknight - Easy fight. Sometimes mind controls people, but you can purge it off. And sometimes throws out shadowbolts, which the grounding totem can negate.","date":"2006-11-07T11:44:52-06:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Various people have different ideas about the ideal group composition to do this quest.

Yes it is hard but is still completely possible if you take your time and know a few tricks.\n\nI've done this quest several times now with different groups and haven't failed yet. Your group doesn't have to be decked out in great gear to do this. My groups have been geared in blues normally.\n\nQuests:\n[60] Material Assistance: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=7667\n[60] The Darkwreaver Menace: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=8258\n\nParty Build (my preference)\n1 priest- Healing, Shackle, Shadow Resistance(the first time I did this we found out our priest was shadow specced after we started, we still made it) 1 warrior- Tank so that the other shamans can dps down whatever he is attacking 3 shaman- 3ankh=3attempts if needed, totems for buffing ecspecially having 3 grounding totems at once explained later on Of course this isn't the exact build you have to go with, I'm just saying this is what I've used without failure and I think you'll see why as you follow along.\n\nBefore You Start\nAnkh for each shaman, 1 stack of lvl 55 water\/food per member from a friendly mage, Pots if you can afford them (we never used pots though)\n\nI'm going to attempt to draw out this scenario for you to help you understand what I'm trying to say. (got the idea from a dankish site) Rattlegore's Room- \"Great Ossuary's basement in Scholomance\"\n\n'X' = Where party stays most of the time.\n'D' = Where I've place the Divination Scryer each time(basically as far away from group as possible)\n'1'\/'2'\/'3' = represent a location of 3 elite ghosts\n________________[door]___________________\n\n|_x_________________________________1_|\n\n|_____________________________________|\n\n|_____________________________________|\n\n|_________________2___________________|\n\n|_____________________________________|\n\n|_______________________________D_____|\n\n|_3___________________________________|\n\n_________________________________________\n\nNote: Plz get your group to alt+tab and read this before going in.\n\n1. Clear the entire room before starting (obvious I know)\n\n2. Rest up etc. and get everyone into position 'X' as far in that corner as possible.\n\n3. Have 1 shaman go place the Scryer as far from the group in the opposite corner as possible 'D' and run back.\n\nNote: Again, do not leave that corner your in 'X'\n\n4. The event has now started, you will be facing wave after wave of ghosts. These really aren't that bad, keep your totems down to buff up your group. Priest can shackle if really needed. Make sure the Warrior keeps aggro of any ghosts on top of the group. All three of the shaman should focus on the warriors target and dps it down. You will easily go through each ghost one at a time while several ghosts are pounding on your tank. Earthbind totem here is really helpful, the reason for this is the ghosts can create illusions of themselves and Earthbind totem gets rid of those illusions.\n\n5. Generally you should have enough time to mana\/heal up between waves of ghosts. Just be ready to drink\/eat as soon as you kill the last ghost of each wave.\n\n6. The last wave of green ghosts will put a curse on the group that causes players to take more damage when hit. This curse lasts 10minutes. Finish off this last wave. At this point the 9 elite ghosts should spawn in the locations 1\/2\/3 of the room as displayed on the map I made posted above. Now you are safe to rest up your char. and yourselves. The 3 groups of elite quests will not come over to your group positioned in corner 'X' unless provoked, so go ahead and take a break to wait out the curse. Doing this will greatly increase your chances of success.","date":"2006-12-05T12:50:06-06:00","rating":48,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":2,"id":6168,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"bizang","body":"7. The Hardest Part- 9 Elites\r\nDo not kid yourself that you can take 9 elites or even 6 elites at once. The biggest problem is that these ghosts have a very very large aggro radius. This creates problems because most people will try to get their timing right to try and pull group '2' of the ghosts but instead pull all 3 groups. Everyone says the key to this is 'pulling' but I strongly disagree, as a matter of fact you don't want to pull, you want to rush in.\r\nThat's right, I said 'rush in'. Watch how the ghosts move and notice how far apart group '2' and '1' can get. What your going to do is have your priest shield your warrior run over to group '1' while hugging the wall(do not 'charge' in, avoid anything that will make your aggro range bigger). Once you see that your warrior has aggro of the group '1' ghosts and didn't pull group '2' also, go ahead and have your whole group hug the wall and run over to him. Priest shackle one ghost and everyone else focus on 1 ghost at a time. Again totem as needed, and yes these ghosts hit fairly hard.\r\n\r\nNow you should have destroyed group '1' and only have 6 more elite ghosts to go. Eat\/drink up. Move everyone back to position'X'. Have your warrior stand at the door or against that wall in a position he can see group '2' and '3'. It will be his job to pull group '2' into the corner you fought group '1'. Make sure you warrior isn't to trigger happy on doing this, but if he does mess up and pull both groups just let him die. Rez him and try again. Once your warrior has only group '2' in the corner where group '1' was go ahead and run over to him and take care of the group just like the previous.\r\nNow you are home free! Rest up and go take out group '3' without worries of groups '1'\/'2'.\r\n\r\n7.5 You should finish off the last set of elite green ghosts in the X corner. After you kill the last group of green elite ghosts, an Aspect will spawn. Shackle him immediately, take some time to get mana back (reshackle until you are ready), then kill the Aspect. After you kill the Aspect more purple ghosts will spawn. KILL THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE! If you do it right, you should never have more than 2 ghosts spawned at a time, shackle one, DPS the other, keep the grounding totems coming (and level 1 earth shocks work awesome here). If you don't kill them fast enough, they will continue to spawn in to where you could have 6-7+ elite ghosts to deal with and it's pretty much game over. Then, when the second Aspect spawns, shackle him again, regen mana, and prepare for the boss fight. Once you kill this Aspect, the Boss will spawn and immediately aggro.\r\n(Thanks for this section -- Skraggy Level 60 Tauren Shaman -- Guild:The Tribe -- Realm:Aggramar)","date":"2006-12-05T12:51:18-06:00","rating":37,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":3,"id":6172,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"bizang","body":"8. Boss fight\r\nLong easy fight. Seeing as how you have 3 shaman make sure each of you is keeping your Grounding Totem down. The boss has some pretty heavy shadow bolts that do the majority of his damage and the grounding totems will take care of that. Keep a positive outlook and take this guy down, you've already passed the hardest part that almost everyone else wipes on.\r\n\r\nSideNote: The Boss also MC's occasionally. Have the shamans ready to purge, and use your level 1 earth shocks like crazy to interupt his Dominate Mind spell (SpellAlert mod will show you when he's casting it). (Thanks Skraggy)\r\n\r\n9.

Anytime he sees a 1-2% crit item he thinks \"useless\" without realising multiple 2% crit chance items could make you crit once every 3 times you cast an LB etc..","date":"2005-11-27T16:25:57-06:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"eltestor","importedSubject":"2% crit is  useful for elem builds."},{"commentv2":1,"number":19,"id":2701036,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"LOL, thats some nice looking shammy!","date":"2005-11-27T16:25:57-06:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SpiRiTcRuSheR","importedSubject":"OMG"},{"commentv2":1,"number":20,"id":2701050,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Finally got around to doing this last night.\n\nParty was\n\nMe&nbsp; - Heavy Resto (0\/14\/37) Shammy\nWarrior - Protection\/Ams\nPriest - Shadow\/Disc\nPriest - Disc\/Holy\nHunter - Marks\/Survival\n\nAll members were equipped in standard instance blues\/set items (no gear from anywhere higher than DM\/UBRS) me and one of the priests had 1 Epic (Hide of the Wild)\n\nHad some problems summoning at first but found the spot eventually.

Again, shackle one, once it is near you, just keep shackle ready. Once you kill this group of the&nbsp; wave, your tank hugs wall again.. walks back to left then walks forward till that group of wave aggros onto him.. he walks straight back to wall.. then&nbsp; straight back along wall back to the corner. You will do this for each wave that appears like this one. \n&nbsp; One wave has singles scattered in it, you MUST kill all these as fast as possible or they keep respawning. It is safe to move out of corner to draw them to you on this wave.&nbsp; I believe there is 7 waves all together?&nbsp; \n\n7. Make sure to keep the aggro off the priest\/mage\/warlock whichever ones you are using.

Reason being Blizzard understands we eat mana like a stoner in a twinkie factory, therefore instead of giving us a little more mana to meaninglessly blow through they gave us Spirit to regain what we spend.\n\nMissing the Intel for that .1% to crit?  The Helm gives you +2% to Crit with Spells.\n\n+13 Strength translates to a small nod to shield blocking and +26 attack power.\n\n+14 Stamina?  Who the hells going to complain about Stamina?\n\n+1% Crit to Melee, if you have points in the Enhance tree you should have +5% to crit already, so this is a fair amount.\n\nAs for the looks, I love it.  Everyone looks at it and thinks \"ZOMG BATMAN!\" or as I play a Female Orc much like the one pictured, \"ZOMG CATWOMAN!\"\n\nThe only reason you think this is because of the movies, comics and cartoons.  I'm a HUGE Batman fan, but when I look at this I see what I figure Blizzard intended.  The helm is really covered by the skin of a black panther.  Easy enough observation and conclusion as Shaman are spiritual leaders and attuned to the natural world.  Panthers are just flowing with those primal mystical energies and it matches the stats on the item.\n\nOthers like to complain about the large blue\/purple gem in the center, and I say \n\n\"Skyfury Helm\"\n\n`nuff said.\n\nSo stop complaining and start understanding how your Shaman should work.\n\nOn a side note - I've had three of these.  The first time I ran the Quest I was given two.  I sharded one, kept the other.  I then threw a +8 Agility Enchant on it and after the lvl 50 Shaman Quest came out I could once again recieve this Quest.  Not being a fool I snagged it and led a party of Two Shaman, Two Mages and one Priest to help a friend get his and snag a third helm to throw either a stam or armor enchant on for my Tanking Set.\n\nEdited, Tue Nov 15 09:27:51 2005","date":"2005-11-15T14:59:24-06:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Crispian","importedSubject":"Skyfury - Accept - No - Substitutes"},{"commentv2":1,"number":41,"id":3081458,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"http:\/\/img387.imageshack.us\/img387\/9660\/image21vy.jpg\n\nThis helmet comes from the Shaman quest \"Darkreaver Menace\".

You have to clear out Rattlegore's room out to start the quest. Best place to have the party is the corner directly to the right once you enter the basement.<br /><br />There are three different kind of Spirit colors that spawn out.<br /><br />Blues - Easy mobs. AoE the first 10ish that spawn, then a named comes out to the party. After that, you can take your time and drink/eat for a few rounds until another named comes out solo. You can Earthshock the curse, which if it lands curses you increase damage against you by 90.<br /><br />Greens - Drop a Disease Cleanse totem, the ghosts spam a disease that lowers your Stam by 102 I believe it was. Pull the corner near the gates first, making sure you don't aggro the center mobs. Then pull the center, then the last corner. A named comes out after the pulls.<br /><br />Purples - Grounding ground grounding. And focus fire. You have about five seconds until they start aggroing you, so staying in the corner won't help as much. Try to keep one shackled until you have everything under control, and keep throwing Grounding totems down, as the shadow bolts hurt. They keep spawning every so often until the Deathknight fight.<br /><br />Deathknight - Easy fight. Sometimes mind controls people, but you can purge it off. And sometimes throws out shadowbolts, which the grounding totem can negate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bizang</b></h3>I don't know how many shamans I've seen without their SkyFury helm and it saddens me. Yes it is hard but is still completely possible if you take your time and know a few tricks.<br /><br />I've done this quest several times now with different groups and haven't failed yet. Your group doesn't have to be decked out in great gear to do this. My groups have been geared in blues normally.<br /><br />Quests:<br /> Material Assistance: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7667">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7667</a><br /> The Darkwreaver Menace: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8258">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8258</a><br /><br />Party Build (my preference)<br />1 priest- Healing, Shackle, Shadow Resistance(the first time I did this we found out our priest was shadow specced after we started, we still made it) 1 warrior- Tank so that the other shamans can dps down whatever he is attacking 3 shaman- 3ankh=3attempts if needed, totems for buffing ecspecially having 3 grounding totems at once explained later on Of course this isn't the exact build you have to go with, I'm just saying this is what I've used without failure and I think you'll see why as you follow along.<br /><br />Before You Start<br />Ankh for each shaman, 1 stack of lvl 55 water/food per member from a friendly mage, Pots if you can afford them (we never used pots though)<br /><br />I'm going to attempt to draw out this scenario for you to help you understand what I'm trying to say. (got the idea from a dankish site) Rattlegore's Room- &quot;Great Ossuary's basement in Scholomance&quot;<br /><br />'X' = Where party stays most of the time.<br />'D' = Where I've place the Divination Scryer each time(basically as far away from group as possible)<br />'1'/'2'/'3' = represent a location of 3 elite ghosts<br />___________________________________<br /><br />|_x_________________________________1_|<br /><br />|_____________________________________|<br /><br />|_____________________________________|<br /><br />|_________________2___________________|<br /><br />|_____________________________________|<br /><br />|_______________________________D_____|<br /><br />|_3___________________________________|<br /><br />_________________________________________<br /><br />Note: Plz get your group to alt+tab and read this before going in.<br /><br />1. Clear the entire room before starting (obvious I know)<br /><br />2. Rest up etc. and get everyone into position 'X' as far in that corner as possible.<br /><br />3. Have 1 shaman go place the Scryer as far from the group in the opposite corner as possible 'D' and run back.<br /><br />Note: Again, do not leave that corner your in 'X'<br /><br />4. The event has now started, you will be facing wave after wave of ghosts. These really aren't that bad, keep your totems down to buff up your group. Priest can shackle if really needed. Make sure the Warrior keeps aggro of any ghosts on top of the group. All three of the shaman should focus on the warriors target and dps it down. You will easily go through each ghost one at a time while several ghosts are pounding on your tank. Earthbind totem here is really helpful, the reason for this is the ghosts can create illusions of themselves and Earthbind totem gets rid of those illusions.<br /><br />5. Generally you should have enough time to mana/heal up between waves of ghosts. Just be ready to drink/eat as soon as you kill the last ghost of each wave.<br /><br />6. The last wave of green ghosts will put a curse on the group that causes players to take more damage when hit. This curse lasts 10minutes. Finish off this last wave. At this point the 9 elite ghosts should spawn in the locations 1/2/3 of the room as displayed on the map I made posted above. Now you are safe to rest up your char. and yourselves. The 3 groups of elite quests will not come over to your group positioned in corner 'X' unless provoked, so go ahead and take a break to wait out the curse. Doing this will greatly increase your chances of success.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bizang</b></h3>7. The Hardest Part- 9 Elites<br />Do not kid yourself that you can take 9 elites or even 6 elites at once. The biggest problem is that these ghosts have a very very large aggro radius. This creates problems because most people will try to get their timing right to try and pull group '2' of the ghosts but instead pull all 3 groups. Everyone says the key to this is 'pulling' but I strongly disagree, as a matter of fact you don't want to pull, you want to rush in.<br />That's right, I said 'rush in'. Watch how the ghosts move and notice how far apart group '2' and '1' can get. What your going to do is have your priest shield your warrior run over to group '1' while hugging the wall(do not 'charge' in, avoid anything that will make your aggro range bigger). Once you see that your warrior has aggro of the group '1' ghosts and didn't pull group '2' also, go ahead and have your whole group hug the wall and run over to him. Priest shackle one ghost and everyone else focus on 1 ghost at a time. Again totem as needed, and yes these ghosts hit fairly hard.<br /><br />Now you should have destroyed group '1' and only have 6 more elite ghosts to go. Eat/drink up. Move everyone back to position'X'. Have your warrior stand at the door or against that wall in a position he can see group '2' and '3'. It will be his job to pull group '2' into the corner you fought group '1'. Make sure you warrior isn't to trigger happy on doing this, but if he does mess up and pull both groups just let him die. Rez him and try again. Once your warrior has only group '2' in the corner where group '1' was go ahead and run over to him and take care of the group just like the previous.<br />Now you are home free! Rest up and go take out group '3' without worries of groups '1'/'2'.<br /><br />7.5 You should finish off the last set of elite green ghosts in the X corner. After you kill the last group of green elite ghosts, an Aspect will spawn. Shackle him immediately, take some time to get mana back (reshackle until you are ready), then kill the Aspect. After you kill the Aspect more purple ghosts will spawn. KILL THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE! If you do it right, you should never have more than 2 ghosts spawned at a time, shackle one, DPS the other, keep the grounding totems coming (and level 1 earth shocks work awesome here). If you don't kill them fast enough, they will continue to spawn in to where you could have 6-7+ elite ghosts to deal with and it's pretty much game over. Then, when the second Aspect spawns, shackle him again, regen mana, and prepare for the boss fight. Once you kill this Aspect, the Boss will spawn and immediately aggro.<br />(Thanks for this section -- Skraggy Level 60 Tauren Shaman -- Guild:The Tribe -- Realm:Aggramar)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bizang</b></h3>8. Boss fight<br />Long easy fight. Seeing as how you have 3 shaman make sure each of you is keeping your Grounding Totem down. The boss has some pretty heavy shadow bolts that do the majority of his damage and the grounding totems will take care of that. Keep a positive outlook and take this guy down, you've already passed the hardest part that almost everyone else wipes on.<br /><br />SideNote: The Boss also MC's occasionally. Have the shamans ready to purge, and use your level 1 earth shocks like crazy to interupt his Dominate Mind spell (SpellAlert mod will show you when he's casting it). (Thanks Skraggy)<br /><br />9. Congratulations!<br />Are you serious? Just go get the helm already! <br /><br />DISCLAIMER<br />I wrote all of the above out of memory. There's some other waves of ghosts in there somewhere, but I don't remember how many etc. I have done this in this manner 3 times and never had serious problems. One of the times I did this it was for a lvl 60 &amp; 59 friend. I found out you don't even have to be lvl 60 to complete and get this helm. Next time I do this quest I'll take more careful notes and will update this guide with more information. If you have suggestions for me I'll kindly take them and update this. I'm only speaking from my experience here and would like others input.<br /><br />Let Me Know If This Helped You!<br />After using this guide please post with your results and opinions.<br /><br />**ripped from Trixly post**</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9304</b></h3>For a PVP shaman this is a very nice pre-MC piece. A 20/31 PVP Shaman is going to focus on increasing there melee primarily and secondly spell critical strike chances. <br />In regards to the above post... break down the math? <br />The blue set helm will give you an additional shock 300 - 500 dmg a fight right? <br />If you combine this piece with a collection of +crit gear that a 31/20 shammy would look for then it will help you get your %crit high enough to crit windfury consistently, drop a SS on top of that and a Earthshock, you are looking at 2000 dmg on the low end... possibilities are huge. <br /><br />Now I do coincide that this piece ALONE will not make a huge difference... however, you are not looking at the larger picture. How will this piece fit with my build and how will this piece work with the rest of my gear. <br /><br />If you have a spattering of Str, Sta, Agi, Int, Spr and +crit spell/melee then you are just going to spread yourself thin. Add this piece together with Blackhand, Warpwood, Deathdealer BP, Bloodsoul Gauntlets, plus talents and you've easily got 20% crit. With that you will almost always land a windfury proc/ss combo in a fight. <br /><br />In my opinion, if you are a hybrid or a PVE Shaman then no... this piece isn't worth it. If you are a PVP shaman looking for +crit (like myself) then this piece is invaluable! +2% to spells and 1% to melee! A blue would never have more than +2% w/o comparable stats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a Shaman only item, as it is a reward from a Shaman only quest.<br /><br />It requires 5 manning Scholomance, as well as an Azerothian Diamond and a Pristine Black Diamond.<br /><br />So that means hunters (praised be the lord) don't get to roll on this, which they'd probably do, in spite of this item's not having any Agility and having Strenght instead. <br /><br />This is one of the very few Shaman items designed for Enhancement shaman.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is the new reward for the old Shaman quest. The old helm was called the helm of Latent power.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The item shown above is correct. Its a shaman quest&nbsp; wich recruires killing a boss in Scholomance. As a prequest u need to deliver 1x prisinte black diamond and 1x azerothian diamond. Than u get the quest and u need to kill a boss with a low drop chance on the skull u need to deliver for the quest.<br /><br />u can get the followup quest from the shaman trainerin the room in front of Thrall's room.<br /><br />-Okk lvl 60 shaman Sunstrider</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The following are true facts about this helm : : <br /><br />1): It is a shaman only quest that requires you to 5man scholo.<br /><br />2): You must use the item you get from obtaining the quest to even summon the boss to get helm.<br /><br />3): When the boss dies he drops his HEAD not this helm - you turn in his HEAD to get this HELM<br /><br />4): Hunters should be NERFED and need to have FOCUS or ENERGY for attacks instead of mana - I'm so tired of hunters having better stuff than some shaman, mages, priests, and druids.<br /><br />5): Hunters get thier OWN quest to get thier epic BOW. So they don't deserve this helm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Some tips from a vet of this event:<br />- After starting it, move to the corner directly across from the entrance to the basement.<br />- If you keep your 5-man party in that corner, at least 3 or 4 breaks in combat will allow you to drink and rebuff.<br />- If for some reason you wipe and cannot rez the party, to get a new Divination Scryer, abandon the quest, then get it again from your trainer in Org.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>2% on it's own doesn't add a lot (Homer was right on that) to your overall dmg. However, if you stack +crit items and pick the right talents, you can EASILY break the 20% crit chance barrier (possibly even 30% with high end gear) with lighning bolts. Heck, you can gain 11% chance to crit from talents alone if you go elem/restore. <br /><br />If you use Homer's logic, you would would only crit for around 5-7% of the time with your spells. Why? because he would never bother to stack the items and talents because he looks at them as &quot;parts&quot; rather then their potential as a &quot;whole&quot;. Anytime he sees a 1-2% crit item he thinks &quot;useless&quot; without realising multiple 2% crit chance items could make you crit once every 3 times you cast an LB etc..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>LOL, thats some nice looking shammy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finally got around to doing this last night.<br /><br />Party was<br /><br />Me&nbsp; - Heavy Resto (0/14/37) Shammy<br />Warrior - Protection/Ams<br />Priest - Shadow/Disc<br />Priest - Disc/Holy<br />Hunter - Marks/Survival<br /><br />All members were equipped in standard instance blues/set items (no gear from anywhere higher than DM/UBRS) me and one of the priests had 1 Epic (Hide of the Wild)<br /><br />Had some problems summoning at first but found the spot eventually. Stayed mostly in the north west corner.<br /><br />Managed to pull more mobs than was advisable a couple of times but between Frost traps and 2 shackles mostly kept it under control. Rested by shackling the 'Aspect' ghosts and waiting on regen when we needed to (only needed this on the last spawn before the Deathknight) Combined with Mana Spring/Tide totems we only went OOM once or twice (yay for pots)<br /><br />Only casualty was myself (and the hunters pet :P)due to aggroing the Deathknight straight away at low health after the last aspect mob. Party drew him away and continued the fight while I ankhed/drank and joined the fray again to finish him off.<br /><br />Event was a challenge but not quite the nightmare I was expecting from some of the comments above. Seems one of the few fights i've been in where mana conservation is the key to victory rather than straight dps. I also cant emphasise enough how helpful having two priests for shackle was.<br /><br />Helm is nice but not much use for a heal spec (I prefer the 27 int of Horns of Eranikus for that) so i'll more likely wear it for posing/grinding/pvp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did this with a shadowpriest, protection specced warrior, warlock and 2 shamans. I think this is the best party because a warlock has more hp than a mage but still has good AoE spells. Locks can also soulstone which is gonna come in quite useful when doing this quest. Because if you get into the room and place the item in the middle the gate closes, so if you die you can't go in there again. So soulstone and reincarnation is gonna save you if you wipe. And just stand in the corner on the right when you come through the gate. We wiped twice on the green ghosts, but finally managed and i got my helm :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Guys remember you can try many other classes, A PRIEST IS NOT really that needed...yer shackle is nice...but its not needed...when you have top players or even good players who listen to you it can be done. <br /><br />Group i had was<br /><br />1) Warrior - Full Valor<br />2) Druid - Full blues<br />3) Me - Blues and Epics<br />4) Shaman - Blues and Epics<br />5) Mage - PVP gear<br /><br />well our gear might have played some role...but its the player u get...our tank was a killer and good...the druid was a good off-tank and healer, we 2 shamans were specced resto and enchanement so we did melee and heal at the same time. Mage just did her job...finished it easily</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>BATMAN HELMET</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, luckily for me, there are a few great guildmates who helped me to get this helm. <br />Take your argent dawn trinket if you want to get stones.&nbsp; <br />Make sure you have plenty of heal pots and mana pots guys.&nbsp; Heck if you have one take yourself a repair bot for the basement, just in case. :D<br /><br />60 Warrior<br />60 Priest<br />60 Mage<br />60 Shammy<br />60 Shammy<br /><br />1.&nbsp; On the way to basement,make sure you take your time before hand and make good pulls and dont make nooby mistakes (hangs head in guilt).&nbsp; Also, don't sheep mobs at the back.&nbsp; They tended to wander real far to the next groups and added some disaster to our group before we ever reached the bottom.&nbsp; Don't hit sheeped mob or shackled mob on accident (bad me). :D&nbsp; <br /><br />2. Stand on steps outside of Ossuarry (sp?) to pull single constructs, one at a time!, until all but the ones on side walls are dead. You can move into room, at that point, or just keep pulling to stairs, your choice. <br /><br />*side note 'skin of shadow' bop, dropped off the constructs* 2 back to back. It's for a quest you get from Inn at WPL (don't know the name of it)<br /><br />3. Shackling is a must for the waves so your guys can remana, heal.<br /><br />4. We found that it was best, after killing all the constructs, one at a time, to stand in the right corner, from where you first walk in.<br /><br />5. You place the scryer in middle towards back. Once you do this, the gate LOCKS and you CANNOT get back in if you wipe as group and have no rezzer inside of room. Make sure you have at least on guy able to pop incase you wipe.<br /><br />6. Make sure your group is ready when you place the scryer because the first wave shows immediately and every one comes at your group. (my bad guys, but great recovery).<br /> When the second wave arrives, your all standing in the closest right corner, you MUST stay there or you will aggro the rest of the wave. Have your tank stick to the wall.. walk back to the left of the gate, and just pull the firt mobs by walking, the mobs will aggro on him without him shooting or hittting.&nbsp; Soon as they do, he backs up all the way to the corner, still hugging the wall. Again, shackle one, once it is near you, just keep shackle ready. Once you kill this group of the&nbsp; wave, your tank hugs wall again.. walks back to left then walks forward till that group of wave aggros onto him.. he walks straight back to wall.. then&nbsp; straight back along wall back to the corner. You will do this for each wave that appears like this one. <br />&nbsp; One wave has singles scattered in it, you MUST kill all these as fast as possible or they keep respawning. It is safe to move out of corner to draw them to you on this wave.&nbsp; I believe there is 7 waves all together?&nbsp; <br /><br />7. Make sure to keep the aggro off the priest/mage/warlock whichever ones you are using. Priest dies and you have no shackle for the last mob of each wave..&nbsp; gonna be pretty tuff.&nbsp; I would off tank as enh/ele shammy.&nbsp; Thank goodness for other shammy and priest healing. :D<br /><br />8. The Big Guy, :D&nbsp; Your group is all healed all full mana, then you kill the last mob of the wave, fast so your ready for the Reaver.&nbsp; He Mind Controls, so be ready for it, (I think fears too?)&nbsp; I think I'm the only one he got with it, attacked my guildies. :D Everyone blasts him for everything they have, keeping tank healed in process and the shammy since your doing quest for the helmet. :D&nbsp; Less you have a pop still.<br /><br />9.&nbsp; Once he's dead, MAKE SURE YOU LOOT HIS HEAD OFF BODY, after you roll for what he drops. :D&nbsp; For Paladins a green horsie :D is there, I'm horde so don't know more than that on it.<br />&nbsp; <br />10. Turn head back into shammy at Orgrimar in Thrall's place, get your bat helm. :D<br /><br />11. Thank all your mates or group who helped you get this helmet. :D<br /><br />With our weird pulls, noobish mistakes on my part, it took us .. mm 3 hours or so, but I am sure it can be done a lot faster, so good luck to whoever attempts it.&nbsp; For me it was my first purple so I love it no matter what. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Our party make-up was 3 Shaman, 1 Warrior, and 1 Priest. The only time we died was on the 3rd wave with a miss-pull (got the middle group after us!)<br /><br />The only advice that I can give is that you NEED a tank and a priest. The other 3 can be whatever you want (preferably shaman so 3 people can knock out the quest!)<br /><br />And for the non shaman out there, help us out with this one! It was possibly one of the most fun and intense battles I've ever taken part in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got the skyfury helm in a really odd way.&nbsp; We got through all the waves of ghosts and to the end boss.&nbsp; Our group wiped and we had to run back.&nbsp; As you know you are locked out of the room leading downstairs on the way back in.&nbsp; Well for some reason I sat by the gate and jumped up and down....and sure as hell if I didn't aggro the boss!&nbsp; He came charging at me, ran through the gate and we killed him upstairs!&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This Helm is the Ultimate (pre-MC) no matter what your Build.<br /><br />Some of you are crying for the Spirit to be changed to Intel but look at our set pieces - very Spirit Heavy. Reason being Blizzard understands we eat mana like a stoner in a twinkie factory, therefore instead of giving us a little more mana to meaninglessly blow through they gave us Spirit to regain what we spend.<br /><br />Missing the Intel for that .1% to crit? The Helm gives you +2% to Crit with Spells.<br /><br />+13 Strength translates to a small nod to shield blocking and +26 attack power.<br /><br />+14 Stamina? Who the hells going to complain about Stamina?<br /><br />+1% Crit to Melee, if you have points in the Enhance tree you should have +5% to crit already, so this is a fair amount.<br /><br />As for the looks, I love it. Everyone looks at it and thinks &quot;ZOMG BATMAN!&quot; or as I play a Female Orc much like the one pictured, &quot;ZOMG CATWOMAN!&quot;<br /><br />The only reason you think this is because of the movies, comics and cartoons. I'm a HUGE Batman fan, but when I look at this I see what I figure Blizzard intended. The helm is really covered by the skin of a black panther. Easy enough observation and conclusion as Shaman are spiritual leaders and attuned to the natural world. Panthers are just flowing with those primal mystical energies and it matches the stats on the item.<br /><br />Others like to complain about the large blue/purple gem in the center, and I say <br /><br />&quot;Skyfury Helm&quot;<br /><br />`nuff said.<br /><br />So stop complaining and start understanding how your Shaman should work.<br /><br />On a side note - I've had three of these. The first time I ran the Quest I was given two. I sharded one, kept the other. I then threw a +8 Agility Enchant on it and after the lvl 50 Shaman Quest came out I could once again recieve this Quest. Not being a fool I snagged it and led a party of Two Shaman, Two Mages and one Priest to help a friend get his and snag a third helm to throw either a stam or armor enchant on for my Tanking Set.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Nov 15 09:27:51 2005</div>

It is a new reward meant to replace the Helm of Latent Power, which is certainly a poor reward for such a difficult quest. If you deleted your Helm, don't worry, you can still get the Skyfury Helm by going and talking to the quest giver provided that you have already completed the quest.<br /><br />Although it lacks in intellect, it is certainly an awesome helmet for healing. Tonight in Zul'Gurub I pulled off <i>four</i> critical heals in a row with my Lesser Healing Wave, not to mention tons of others. Not bad at all for PvP either.</div>
