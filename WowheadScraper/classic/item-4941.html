<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>13169</b></h3>Once the glue runs you, you may want to invest in Engineering and get the Net-o-matic. Once you try the glue in pvp, and it runs out.... you wont know how you lived without it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>is it possible to make this stuff?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It doesn't seem like it.&nbsp; I sure wish it was because it rocks in PvP.&nbsp; Oh well, I think engineering has nets, so they should be pretty similar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ya, and while you're at it, make you're way over to Brill, and get the quest that gives you 'slumber sand' as a reward too.&nbsp; The looks on peoples faces in PvP when a rogue, net's them with glue, and later puts them to sleep for 20 seconds is priceless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Horde only, is there an alliance version of this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Because you can farm yours.<br /><br />We cant. We get 10 and thats it, unless we buy them from others.<br /><br />You can get as many as you want long as you put the time into it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Looks like you ve been super stickied or put into slumber with sand :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the large rope nets are a pain in the ass since they dont stack in the inventory. but i guess farming just a full bag's worth while waiting in queue would be a productive way to pass time... we also get magic dust (30s sleep) which is also farmable, and way more useful IMO since im an engineer and can sleep -&gt; death ray -&gt; win.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lol..I got this from the quest, and knew it would come in handy..just sold it on the AH for 13gold. Easy to farm...im not sure if there is a required level to get the quest, but if there isnt, just keep making characters, and have a higher level friend just keep running you through the quest...If there is a level requirement, then still farm this item, but it will take longer..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To my dismay this is now bind on pickup in 1.7 <br />So my lvl-1 alt is sitting on 8 stacks on this stuff he was holding for my main and now has to vendor it. Joy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Monsters greater than the intended level for this glue will be highly resistant to the sticky effect: either fully resisted or breaks very quickly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can this be used, for example: cast it on a Deviate Stinglash, start taming process... Yay it didnt have a chance to kill me so i win!<br /><br />or will the Stinglash (lvl 16-17 elite) just mock me for my pathetic efforts and break out of the glue like nobody's business?<br /><br />I'm making a troll hunter on Dunemaul in 2 weeks (my new computer is on the way): gimme a holler if you wanna quest together or something</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On MTs who happen to be tanking World Dragons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No-brainer upgrade from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=54333">Netherweave Net</a>.&nbsp; Lasts more than three times as long!<br /><br />Dunno exactly how the resistances work, but I was able to successfully glue one of Drakkisath's personal bodyguards in place (in Upper Blackrock Spire).&nbsp; Drakkisath himself is immune, however, so don't waste a glue on him like I did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this with my Orc hunter, took it Blood Elf starting area and used it in our battle with Lurzan and Knucklerot, two 21 elites, and it worked on them.&nbsp; Also used it on the 30 elite panther in Thousand Needles, solo'd him at 29 b/c of this stuff.&nbsp; I really wish there were some way an Alchemist or Leatherworker (glue, think about it...) could make it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, here's some advice: DO NOT DELETE OR SELL THIS STUFF!&nbsp; It still works at level 60 and beyond, and is wonderful for PVP.<br /><br />To give an example, I was questing in Outlands yesterday when a level 70 hunter decides to try and gank me.&nbsp; I see him coming, and immediately open up with a fear on him, and net his pet with this.&nbsp; I continue to chain-fear and dot him, and once the net breaks on his pet I use the Gnomish Net-O-Matic on it again.&nbsp; Eventually the hunter is immune to fear but by this time he's getting low on health.&nbsp; He's trying to get into shooting range and his pet breaks free of the net.&nbsp; I deathcoil the pet and intercept the hunter with my felguard after he wingclips me.&nbsp; This goes on for a bit longer (he is level 70 after all), the pet starts beating on me and he gets some shots in after scattershotting me, but I use healthstone/healthpot to survive just long enough.&nbsp; Next thing you know, dead hunter.<br /><br />Moral of story:&nbsp; This works great on noob wanna be gankers.&nbsp; I was literally seconds away from death when the hunter died, and rooting his pet his pet early on saved my life.&nbsp; The glue also works well for rooting rogues, warriors and paladins who are mostly lacking in ranged attacks.<br /><br />FYI, I was a 60 demo lock at the time.&nbsp; The sad thing is, some noob ally warlock killed me immediately after I got the hunter, but I died with a huge smile on my face :D<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Also good for rooting other players who are trying to get away from you!&nbsp; Can be used in BGs as well.&nbsp; Too bad you only get 10 of them...but the Net-O-Matic (engineering only) and Netherweave Net both have similar effects.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Oh jeez. There goes my free 6g once in awhile! BOP!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If its bind on pick up then you cant give it OR sell it. What are you guys talking about? making a bunch of lvl 6 chars isnt gonna do anything either. They all will just have 10 of the glue.................</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Has anyone ever tried selling this in the Tanaris AH?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone tried this one in pve? any mobs this would be imba on? (thinking mc mobs/boss adds).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you want to PvP at least semi seriously then this is a must. Esp for a caster. Think of a mage using this and pumping out what 400 dps? Thats like a free 4k damage, plus it gives cooldowns a chance to end. This item wtfpwns everything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>does anyone know if you can buy this, or better yet, something else that can do the same thing. As a warrior, other players tend to run and do ran shots, 10 sec is all i need to kill them (or run from them if their higher !)<br /><br />i mean, i would pay gold for this, its well worth it !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>is this a repeatable quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This sells for gold, thou I would never sell it, its WAY too usefull on pvp server. It's a root for non-root classes!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yea. Too bad its BoP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This item really helped me out when I was taming pets around my same level on my Hunter. The quest is really simple and can be safely completed solo around level 6. It reduces the amount of damage a Hunter will have to take during the Taming process by keeping the target pet a safe distance away from the Hunter for at least 10 seconds, which is a large help. I highly recommend keeping this handy whenever you are going to change pets are attempt to tame pets close or equal to your level.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Why stop at lvl 6 just to get the glue? If your gonna farm this with expedible alt characters, then go ahead and farm the slumber sand too, lvl 9 quest.</div>
