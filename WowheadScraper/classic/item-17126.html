<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Mathias Shaw in Stormwind gives this letter to you. I'm not sure at what point he gives it to you, as I hadn't talked to him in many levels, and went and talked to him at 56 and he said there was a letter available. Seems to be buggy though - he actually only gave the option and the letter to the 56 druid I was grouped with, and not to me as a rogue, which is a little strange...<br /><br />Update on this: I paged a GM, and eventually got a reply e-mail: &quot;I believe Mathias offers the letter to all players even though they will be unable to finish the quest if not a rogue.&nbsp; I have seen this myself in game.&nbsp; As to aquiring the quest yourself many quest Npc's will only give out their quest if previous Npc's have been spoken with.&nbsp; You may want to try asking your peers in general chat or check the forums at worldofwarcraft.com.&quot; So, peers, any ideas? The druid I was grouped with has not done any quests nor talked to any NPCs except the ones that I have talked to, and I have been unable to find anything on other Mathias Shaw quests...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Pretty sure I was given this by a Rogue trainer in the Forlorn Cavern in Ironforge.&nbsp; As a lvl 43 druid ^_^.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was making room and through it out. can i get agian?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Alright, cant remember how I got it, but it was either from a rogue trainer (Prolly UC), at lvl 24, or in mail. Info about the quest. Easy to do at 24, dont need to be able to remove trap on chest, just detect it, and walk past and keep going to the manor. There talk to the NPC, and he will ask you to STEAL insignias. I&nbsp; do suggest you do just that, and pickpocket them. You can pick pocket all the stupid guards there, get 30 insignias (Aswell as half a douzen cheap lockboxes, wich you cant (Or rarely get) when killing them.)<br />And when you turn in those insignias, you get friendly with manor (30 insignias, and it is max sadly). Should also get the quests in tarren mill at the same time, 2 you can do there I believe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You talk to the UC trainer and he will have an option &quot;Give me that&quot; When you click it will add the letter to your inventory.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a rogue, got the letter at around level 20, unfortunatly, can't remember where, Think it was beside rogue trainer in either orgimmar or undercity. Anyway, got the pendant, again, can't remember where,, sorry, but after finding the manor, i approached the proper fella, but it would not let me continue the quest. Tried putting it on me, tried putting it on him, tried everything, would not let me continue. Sent a messege to blizzard, advised me can't help with in-game help?, consult the forums,,,lol,,,<br />any ideas?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok the trick is you have to enter the tunnel and use detect trap and you will see the chest to the left. walk up to it and that is the right of cunning go to ravenholdt and turn in the quest that is all that is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I recieved the letter to go to si-7 then got the seal to go to find Ravenholdt Manor saw the man at Ravenholdt recieved the quest to go pickpocket some seal i picked 100 brought them back got a&nbsp; job well done by the guards nothing from the top dog. what are you supposed to do with 100 seal that no one at Ravenholdt would take?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can get to Farhad to turn in and I have the seal but it will not let me turn it in when I select to turn in quest instead of train.&nbsp; Is anyone else having this problem?&nbsp; Does anyone know what I need to do to turn this quest in?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Help please. I did everything in this quest and the problem came when I went to turn in the seals to the guards. I had put some in the bank and some were in my bag, I only turned in the ones in my bag which did not total 30. I had to go back to the bank to get the rest, then I returned and turned the ones from the bank in. The blue ? went off over the guard and I received nothing.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got this letter from someone in SI:7<br />i found the place and have the seal of ravenholdt<br />i go to turn it in but he wont accept it.<br />also ive never seen a trap but ive always seen the chest adn when i open it a lvl 33 elite comes out. ive killed him once with some help from a warlock and he just disappeared.<br />I also went back to the master rogue and he asked if id met mathias, the guy in the chest, but it still didnt complete teh quest.&nbsp; I really dont know what to do, can someone please help me.<br />thanks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where do the horde get the letter from?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You get the Elegant Letter - which starts The Manor, Ravenholdt quest - from your Rogue trainer. I got mine from Osborne the Night Man in Stormwind. Hillsbrad is in Horde territory. I suggest checking the world map on <a href="https://www.worldofwarcraft.com" rel="nofollow">www.worldofwarcraft.com</a> in order to find out where you have to go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finally found out how to get the letter back after I thru it away.<br /><br />Abondon the Ravenholdt Quest.<br /><br />Go see &quot;Osbourne the night man&quot; at SI:7 in Stormwind.<br /><br />Select give it to me!<br /><br />Look in your bag and the elegant Letter will be there.<br /><br />Once You open the letter to begin the quest.<br />the &quot;Seal of Ravenholdt&quot; goes into Your bag and the Letter disappears.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got it on one of my rogues, but I think the rogue trainer in Orgy just gave it to me. Anyone know exactly?</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
