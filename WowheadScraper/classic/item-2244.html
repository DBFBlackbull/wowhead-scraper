Fortunately the more people that [i]need[\/i] the item, the worse their chances of winning the roll; you can turn this to your advantage by offering proportionally smaller individual sums to buy out their rolls.\n\nMost important is to remember first of all that it [u]is[\/u] a game, and that if you don't get the item this time, you can buy it off the AH next week, and secondly that despite it being only a game, there is a real player on the other end playing the rogue you're about to deny the Krol Blade...\n\nIt's become pretty clear to me over the years that not only is social currency to be valued more highly than gold, but that the latter is much easier to make back.","date":"2006-01-15T15:11:47-06:00","rating":22,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"The mage only needs the krol blade to put it on AH, so he can get his epic mount.\n\nThe rogue needs it to use AND he can put it one AH, so he can get his epic mount.\n\nKrol blade should only be needed on by people who intend to use it.

It's hands-down the best pre-60 rogue weapon in the game thanks to its slow speed, high damage, and +1% crit ability.<br /><br />Goes for anywhere between 175 and 300 gold on Draenor-Horde.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1841</b></h3>The only good thing about this sword is the required level, which is amazingly low. Unless you want to get it immediately, at level 51, or you are very rich, it's not worth the money. It's around 300g now but it used to be around 800g.<br /><br />But if you're not in a rush, you can get yourself a Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge which has a tiny bit higher damage, no stamina stat, 3 strength less but best of all, it's free. ;) <br />Another good thing, once combined with Dal'Rend's Tribal Guardian, it forms a set giving you a nice +50AP bonus which further makes it a lot better then the Krol Blade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7069</b></h3>For it's level, it's a nice weapon - but is quickly outdone by other weapons when you hit Level 60. Sadly, people see it as &quot;Wow, it's Epic - must be better than other Swords&quot;.<br /><br />Sword of Zeal is a better main hand weapon for a Rogue for a pure Combat build, pre-raiding Epics.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Asher</b></h3>I agree with the previous posts. It's just another one of those items that Blizzard threw in there and decided to give it an epic category. While it may be tempting to use right away, try your best to hold off on it unless you have no other options. At this level, you can probably go for Dal'Rends as a previous poster said. I would once again try and turn a nice profit off this and put the money towards an enchant on a future weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2969</b></h3>Dropped by the elementals, North-West (top left corner) of Silithus, for me. <br />Sold it for 371g on Aggramar-EU</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>toaae</b></h3>Just got this yesterday for my lvl 51 rogue. Now let me give you a reason why to buy it:<br /><br />Most the time, this thing will be horribly overpriced (like 300g+), but I lucked out and found it for 125g buyout. Considering that theres heaps of gold in Outland, and I had 150g+, I decided to go for it. It's a huge DPS increase (espiacally since I'm lvling with hemo; the slow speed gives me some sick numbers), and at lvl 51, I doubt I'll find a better weapon.<br /><br />So, if you ever see it cheap, have the gold, and are lvl51-53, get it. It's nice to have, deals an insane amount of damage for it's level, and looks cool too. If it'll bankrupt you, or you are in the upper 50s, just skip it. It's a good weapon until about 60 or 61, but in outland you can better.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If its cheap, your rich, and in the low 50s, get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>19583</b></h3>What most people fail to realize is how low the required level is. Sure, it was (and still is) a crap 60 weapon, but if you get this at 51, it's absolutely fantastic, and WILL make you level an awful lot faster. <br /><br />Now that BC is out and items such as this will become much cheaper, this is a great option for a leveling rogue. I'm trolling the AH myself to get this for my 51 rogue using thrash blade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Catoria</b></h3>I had one drop off a carrion devourer today, WooT!!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>39909</b></h3>The Problem is that you want to save your gold for an epic mount. If you are a fast leveler and don't spend too much time at the AH or profession leveling you will not have too much gold. I just picked up an Outland LV 58 Green and it has 7 more dps. The trash blade should be good enough for a rogue until that level, trust me save your gold, u will need it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4636</b></h3>This sword looks very nice the only thing is that it seems that it is quickly made out dated, that is my only concern. I would say if it drops and is better then use it, but I think it is a waste of money.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>46945</b></h3>Maybe I just suck at finding weapons, or something else. But for me this weapons is 6dps over both my weapons that I currently have. I'm a level 57 Combat Rogue.<br /><br />Although I would probably wait until it's cheap to get, but still I might end up getting it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Random world drop.. only if the mob is 55+</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay here is the arguement, Why?&nbsp; All you gain is 1% crit which can be found on many weapons right?&nbsp; So why a blade that will greatly increase a melee characters attacks.&nbsp; And plz don't say that Hunters are melee, their only pseudo melee try only really allows them to run away and get more arrows in me.&nbsp; Then we are harrassed for rolling on a Preciesly Calibrated Boomstick.&nbsp; well +14 agl is something I can use to, based most hunter arguements for having every rare drop known to man.&nbsp; Yes anyone can use, but there is a line where your personal benifit is outwayed by someone elses and you should pass the buck.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ya this sword is not just for me, but I am sure that I will benifit from the damage increase more than a hunter would.&nbsp; Just makes sense.&nbsp; Hunters don't need all weapons because they can use, they should use the ones that help thier one good trait out, ranged attacking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>60 pally here, if this thing drops it goes to a warrior/rogue, period. One of the best 1handers for rogues in the game, and hunters want it for 1% crit and 5 sta. What a joke. With the &quot;if I can equip it I'm gonna roll on it&quot; attitude, good luck finding instance/raid groups (at least, once you do this in a raid group). Rogues have attacks based on the damage of their weapon, and I think warriors do to, making this WAY better for them than for hunters, even if the hunter is a &quot;melee hunter.&quot; Besides, it's not debatable that hunters use ranged for the vast majority of the time. You don't see warriors/rogues rolling vs hunters for the best bows in the game, but with hunters having this type of attitude, maybe they should. Hell, I can wear chain, I'll start rolling on chain items too. Some items are better for certain classes than others, and this is one of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What is with all freakin Barney soundalikes on this post with their &quot;if anyone wants to roll go ahead-its just a game&quot; - dumbasses.&nbsp; Alright I have both a Hunter and a rogue 45/51 and this blade definately should go to a rog/war way before a hunters.&nbsp; It is definately true hunters on the posts are bull*!@#tin their way in reasoning to get this wep because it is a purp.&nbsp; If you gonna melee, dont make a hunter and honestly i dont see that many hunters willing to go &quot;melee&quot; against another class yet - u wingclip kite them.&nbsp; Honestly if a rogue rolls on an epic bow and won all u dumbass hunters who wrote you wont mind are either full of &amp;*!@ or complete retards who wont be able to help any group.&nbsp; Of course the rogue/war who rolls on the epic ranges over hunters are also complete dip^&amp;*!s.&nbsp; Point is, if this drops wars/rogues get priority but aside from that hunters may roll.&nbsp; Pretty soon were gonna see buncha hunters tankin while rogues are shooting from the back.&nbsp; God ppl need to learn how to play the damn game along and have some common sense.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've always found discussions surrounding BoE epic items interesting due to the fact that everyone focuses on how the <u>item</u> could be better used by one class over another.<br /><br />Has anyone considered that perhaps a mage <i>needs</i> 900 gold? When put in that context, suddenly the argument becomes that a rogue <i>needs</i> this Krol Blade more than a mage <i>needs</i> an epic mount. Clearly, statements like that are absurd.<br /><br />Obviously each group should establish their own rules regarding these situations prior to the drop so as to avoid any unpleasantness, but this is generally overlooked. Personally gold isn't a huge issue for me, and I'd much rather be congratulating a rogue on his new, useable item than congratulating a mage on winning 900 gold. I would hastily pass on this item if a sword rogue was in the group.<br /><br />Of course, if rolling rules haven't been discussed, an oft-used strategy by the party member who desperatly wants it the most is to pay off the other members who also feel they <i>need</i> it. And I don't mean anywhere close to full value, most people will take a small guaranteed sum of money over only a <u>chance</u> to win an epic. Fortunately the more people that <i>need</i> the item, the worse their chances of winning the roll; you can turn this to your advantage by offering proportionally smaller individual sums to buy out their rolls.<br /><br />Most important is to remember first of all that it <u>is</u> a game, and that if you don't get the item this time, you can buy it off the AH next week, and secondly that despite it being only a game, there is a real player on the other end playing the rogue you're about to deny the Krol Blade...<br /><br />It's become pretty clear to me over the years that not only is social currency to be valued more highly than gold, but that the latter is much easier to make back.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is basically a huge sack of gold, cunningly disguised as a sword, for 99% of all people who see it drop. And if you are still using this at lvl 60, eek.<br /><br />Sell it, lvl up and get a Mass of McGowan instead. Same dps, same top end dmg, 3 extra STR, 5 extra STA, and only 120g or so... instead of 500g+</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what do you think a good enchant for this would be?<br /><br />my first epic drop!<br /><br />i am a lvl60&nbsp; warrior (MS build)...&nbsp; sometimes MT sometimes OT.<br />&nbsp; .....and yeah, i'd like a better weapon, but i dig this so far.&nbsp; and my rolling skills suck, so till i get something better - this will have to do.<br /><br />lifestealing?<br />is fiery a waste in the higher instances? <br /><br />what do you all think?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was just going around was bored with my 60 epic mage and i just killed some.. suddenly i got a krol blade.. me: wtf&nbsp; &nbsp; krol blade: AH me!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the day after i was grinding the same place and i got another! me: wtf another?&nbsp; &nbsp; krol blade nr2: AH us both! and i sold em both for around 750-800g and i twinked up a 19 rogue for like all of it ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is without any doubt the best sword in the game for ss rogues in their early fifties. &quot;Outland is better!, outland is better!&quot; scream the mentally challenged, well no duh!, but u gotta be lvl 58 to get there geniuses, and its not that easy to just &quot;level up&quot; from 51 to 58 to get to outland anyways.&nbsp; What this sword does for me at 51 with this on my main hand, my Hanzo on my off, agility enchants on both, is to own lower to mid level dungeons!.&nbsp; I don't have another lvl 70 lying around sending me money, I do not buy my gold off the internet, I get my butt out in Scarlet and Uldamon and make that gold, and this allows me to makes 5-7 gld per hr in just dropped silver, excluding drops that I auction.&nbsp; I know in Outland the monsters drop like a gajillion silver, but re-read the top again.&nbsp; whenever I see like 3 or 4 lvl 40 sumthin warriors/hunters/mages etc. walking into Armory I laugh! Ur gonna waste an hr, u'll each get maybe 1 gold, maybe 2 greens each, and only 1 person can get to keep the rare blue if it drops, the rest of the party will stew about it.&nbsp; Repeat, this sword, enchanted right, complemented by a fast off hander for instant poison purposes that is also enchanted right, complemented by as much agility bonused gear u can get ur hands on, combined with the right combination of assasination/combat points(14/27/0 myself) and tempered with the common sense to not bite off more than u can chew, will allow u to make gold alot faster than most toons ur lvl and will allow u to have the gear in place to get u ready to tackle outland when u hit 58...:)</div>

The entire run was amazing for us. I'm a 59 pally (Soon to hit 60), and still using a Hanzo Sword, since I haven't been able to get anything else. But, the other guildies were nice enough to let me have this thing. It's butt ugly (Seriously looks like a kiddie cartoon weapon), but a nice upgrade from what I had.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For those of you that say this is not good for a fury weapon.. In my opinion your wrong.<br /><br /> Think about it, crit, crit, and crit some more.. And as for fast weapons, why? <br /> Think about it this way.. Not only do slower weapons generate more rage, but flurry is 30% increase attack speed. Which means the slower your weapons the more you get out of that 30%. <br /><br /> On a 1.50 weapons speed weapon, 30% IAS brings you down to.. 1.13 with a real bad rage build speed, BUT..<br /> You take that 2.80 speed and add that 30% IAS your looking at a 2.10 attack speed with getting the most out of rage build not to mention the crit rate + on the weapon. <br /><br /> Off hand a thrash blade with the Krol main hand.. and you have a wicked combo in weapons..</div>
