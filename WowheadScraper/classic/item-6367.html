It's pretty easy to farm one. Just get a water breathing buff or item and swim in a circle opening traps. It took me about 30 minutes to get one. If you are alliance on a PVP server, I'd suggest farming these in off hours when horde are less likely to be in the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2789</b></h3>Well I guess I'm the unlucky one then, I lost track of time but when I finally got it I had 250 shellfish in my bags -.-<br />random is random ;P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6039</b></h3>Don't farm these to sell, you'll waste a lot of time. Just get yours and move on, cause there's probably about 10 horde druids trying to farm these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5909</b></h3>Attempted to farm one of these for over 2 hours. There were also HORDE farming in the area. we kinda made a round robin looking. and got NONE. If you have a lot of time or if your gaining exp by killing the mobs in this area then by all means try to farm one. BUT otherwise you might be better off buying on AH. I would say 1-200 chance but then again I opened 200 and got none.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6460</b></h3>Once you are lvl 44 you can obtain a better fishing rod. The quest is attainable at 44 but requires you kill 15 mobs between lvls 48-50. However these mobs are non-aggro turtles, it should be a breeze to party with someone for a few minutes, kill the turtles, and go collect your nice fishing rod. Not nearly as time-consuming as opening a bazillion shellfish traps.<br /><br />Get thee to Revantusk<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7815">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7815</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>chillyman</b></h3>How unfortunate. I myself have picked up so many of these by grinding shellfish that I suppose it would have been be wise to sell them at the shared AH. Last time I found one of this I have to leave it behind because my bags where full and i didn't want to waste time. Btw, horde gets payed for the shellfish...<br /><br />Alliance fanboys don't.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8677</b></h3>I had read horror stories about people spending hours trying to farm for this fishing pole. I think it is much easier to farm the gold and just buy it off the AH. I bought mine for only 5g, so almost no time was investing in attaining this item. <br /><br />Check your AH and consider farming gold to buy it rather than searching shellfish traps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HappyKilla</b></h3>I guess the fact that I got this just 5 nets, and not only that but I stole it from a member of the opposite faction (killed him as he looted it), makes me a lucky S.O.A.B. :)</div>

There is an easier way to get it and it doesn't concern throwing away a few hours you'd rather have back:<br /><br />The Shellfish Traps respawn every 60 seconds.<br />Find a Bubbly Fissure with one beside it (there is one at loc(19,81) with two traps next to it), (or just be a druid/ warlock/ potiondrinker/ whatever to breathe underwater).<br /><br />Park your character in the bubbles, look on your screen once in a while, open the crate, and go back to whatever else you need doing (reading a book, watching a movie, picking your nose, etc.)<br /><br />Fishing like this might get you a few less per hour (about 50 traps an hour), but at least you can do something else at the same time.</div>

(lvl 35/45 area, out of the top of my head) Jump in the water at the harbour, and open the Traps you find all over the ocean floor. <br /><br />Traps give you lobsters that can be handed in at the dock in exchange to fish you (Horde) need for a quest. Traps might also trigger a lvl 35-ish mob to spawn right on top of you, especially if you open a trap you have opened already a short time before. How delightful. <br />o.0' <br /><br />Some people find the Pole within 2 minutes, others never find it, and a rare few get a handful of these in an hour. They are sold on AH irregularly (obviously more often during weekends), prices shifting from (as I've seen) 25 silver to 7 gold.<br /><br />Hope this helps you. Wonder where the comments went, this was all here before.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks to everyone's comments on here who made it fairly easy to find my brand new Big Iron Fishing Pole!&nbsp; And so here is my effort to pay it forward to someone else:<br /><br />I did the following loop of traps and once I got into the groove it was pretty easy:<br />1) Start at 21,81, which is at the base of a little hill.<br />2) Go south around the base of the hill, keeping the hill on your righthand side to the trap at 20,82.<br />3) You'll be looking into a canyon, so follow southwest around the left side of the rim of the canyon to the trap at 19,85.<br />4) From here you'll be looking into another canyon and if you look into the distance almost due west you'll find a fourth trap at 18,86.<br />5) Head due north, keeping the rim of the canyon on your right, and tucked away behind some ginormous sea anenomes you'll come to another trap at 17,84.<br />6) From here, if you look at your minimap you'll see Shadowprey Village to the northeast.&nbsp; Head straight toward it.&nbsp; Doing so will take you into a canyon.&nbsp; Look straight down and at the bottom of the canyon you will see another trap at 19,82 near a bubbly fissure.<br />7) Coming up out of the canyon, keep the canyon wall on your right and follow it toward the surface and you will come to a trap at 20,80 at the base of a familiar hill.<br />8) And from there just continue a few yards around the hill back to where you started at 21,81.<br /><br />I didn't care about grinding for cash so I usually just rooted the giant lobsters, since it was quicker than fighting them.&nbsp; After all the only reason I was doing this was to get the pole, so the faster I could get to the next trap and open it, the better.&nbsp; Sometimes I was actually too fast and I came to a trap location before it had respawned, but that was no problem since I just went to the next one.<br /><br />Aquatic form obviously was a huge help, but if you don't want to use a breathing potion, keep in mind that all of the traps except the one in number (6) are near the surface, and number (6) is near a bubbly fissure.<br /><br />I must have picked up 100-120 shellfish and several pairs of boots (and one green item), but I kind of wanted to see if I had the patience to not give up, especially since there are two for the taking in the AH right now for about 8g apiece, but it ended up not being too bad.&nbsp; And of course there's the added little perk of pride in knowing I worked for it myself.&nbsp; But I recommend talking on the phone or otherwise multitasking while you're doing this since it doesn't take a whole lot of brainpower and doesn't exactly keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />And now I'm going to use my new pole to finish my Nat Pagle quest!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Actually, there are underwater air supplies around the shellfish traps. Just means you have to keep going back to them...<br /><br />Took me about 2 hours to get mine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>on my old character, the first pole i got, took me about 5 traps. the second pole i got, it took me 2 hours straight of traps. I have -never- seen this pole drop off of the lobster guys, and have killed a million of them. I've also found out that generally traps that drop items like boots or weapons, have a better chance of dropping the pole then one that always spawns a drysnap or shellfish. <br /><br />I've seen the pole go for 50 - 100g in Orgrimar, havent check in Ironforge yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got 2 in 30 mins :) sold the second for 16g on ah :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me a bit. I probably checked about 60 traps or so. I didn't use and water breathing elixirs though, I just found a nice spot with 2 traps and an air bubble vent. It was in the northern part of the area with the traps.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Spent two hours...fruitlessly opening traps, went to AH and bought one for 20G.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As of Nov 3, '05 9am, it took me 35 minutes. I didn't count the traps I opened, but I got 42 shellfish, 5 Cuirboulli boots, 1 cross-stitched sandals, 10 spawned mobs, and then my big iron fishing pole. When the trap gives shellfish, it will be either 1 or 2. I would say it was around 40-50 traps for me.<br /><br />I know someone mentioned something about agro below, and maybe something's changed, but it was normal, these mobs were 14-15 levels below me and agroed me only once in 35 minutes because I swam through the mob. That's not including mobs spawned from the traps which agroed almost every time because of vicinity.<br /><br />When doing this you can use an enduring breath potion, or use the bubbly fissures, there's about 4 of them around the traps. You can make a nice circle and get nearly every trap without downtime, because of the quick spawn rate. Look at the map of the shellfish traps (click on shellfish trap above) and you'll see there's a small radius you can circle around to make the trip very efficient.<br /><br />I hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hi - looking to find the pole. Any ideas what I can do with the vast quantities of Shelfish I gather ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just got mine after half an hour of farming:-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Read the other comments on this listing for a full hunt description detail.<br /><br /> Stand at the end of the dock, or any of it's adjoining beaches in Shadowprey facing the ocean. Dive into the Sar theris Strand and head SW looking down for traps. <br /> Dive down: <br /> you better have breathing gas. You should know this, but for some lower levels that are perusing: Buy it at auction, spend some time waiting for a low price. There are people that sell it for silvers, and there are people that sell it for golds, so be careful. <br /> The humanoids are 32-34 at the beach and in the water around the pier, lvl 35 further out. <br /> It's all in the luck of the draw. I did get a number of rare items and made all my alts very happy fellows, paid my expenses for breathing gases and buffing potions, got my fishing pole, and profited 10g for that 4 hours. There was one persistent elf that was bound and determined to take my route from me and just as I was about to give up, I got my fishing pole from the last trap. I was on my last bottle of gas! But my expenses weren't that big, one of my alts is an alchemist so I get my potions and breathing gas at cost.<br />I wish there was a recipe for all these stinkin' shellfish!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got mine after checking about 70 or so traps. Took about an hour at most for me. Make sure you bring some water breathing potions. Or if you are a shaman like me you have a nice spell to use. :)<br /><br />There are also a few stranglekelp spawn points in the area for any fellow alchemists. <br /><br />Oh, and it's probably not worth it to farm these if there are already one or more people there, since there aren't a whole lot of traps. Though they are spread well, and spawn back reasonably fast.</div>

I got to the place where the traps are, then drank a potion and headed underwater (actually I had opened the first trap before remembering to drink the potion). The SECOND trap I opened had the pole. I literally hadn't spent even two minutes looking; I still had 59 minutes on the water breathing buff left. XD<br /><br />EDIT: Found a second one within 15 minutes.

Then I looked up the rod to see how much they sold for in case I got 2 (ever the optimist!)and saw one for sale with a b/o of 4g and a bid of 1g 50s so I put in a bid on the off chance.<br />Went to look for the rod and spent an hour underwater killing shellfish and getting everything but the rod! I think the drop is much lower than people think and you must be very lucky to get one.<br />Anyway I get back on land and looking at my post find that I have bought the rod! And have loads of shellfish which more than paid for it :-)<br />Moral of the story... while looking for the rod you will make enough to buy one.

So I openned a few more and picked stranglekelp. A half dozen traps later, I had two more big iron fishing poles! Whaaa?<br /><br />I wanted to stay in the water 'til I got all wrinkley, but I had to go. But four of those in about twenty minutes is just silly-lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First time I went after one of these I think it took my pally 2 hours of swimming around and hiding in air pockets. really annoying.<br /><br />Cut to tonight. <br /><br />One Elixir of Greater Waterbreathing and my rogue. Got one in 13 mins. And two more within 35 mins of total checking traps. All of my toons except one now have one and they dont Bind on Equip so you can trade them around. Or sell them. I was beginning to think they upped the drop rates until I read the guy's post before mine...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I spended like 4 hours underwater, used 4 greater underwater breathing elixires and got... like 300 shellfish, lots of old shoes and rusty cogs... I had to open like 400+ of this ^&amp;*!ing stupid traps! GOD! this SUCKS more then I can express... SCREW THIS FISHING POOL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Same here. I've been underwater for prolly close to 6+ hours total. I've checked tons of traps. Killed Lots of horde. Been kiled a few times by horde. Killed a Giant. Founds lots of boots, some engineering parts, and TONS of shell fish, But... No damn fishing pole. <br /><br />I think I'm going to break down and buy one... :(<br /><br />BAH!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Guess I was really lucky. I was out deep diving for the traps, had opened about 4 of them when the server took a dump. When I logged back in I was dead. Recovered my body and swam down to the first trap I saw. Opened and whatta ya know, big iron fishin pole was sitting right there. 5 tries and it was mine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>bought one for 1g at AH. beat that...<br /><br />PST on bleeding hollow if you wanna buy it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The shellfish are for a horde quest. You turn in five and get 50 copper and a bloodbelly fish (level 25 food). This is repeatable as many times as you want.... Turn in two of those fish for another quest at Ghost Walker post.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's no rep gain for this quest, so you can't use it to get a raptor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First time I tried I only had 30 minutes to kill and got nothing for my troubles. Sunday night (two weeks later) I downed a 1hr Water Breathing potion and picked up three in forty minutes. I was doing it specifically to get the rod for one of my characters, kind of a boring way to make money IMO. <br /><br />Edited, Mon Jan 2 16:11:32 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It took well over 12 hours on 2 different characters to finally get this pole, which was spend over 4 sessions, but I finally got mine. Since I had like 20 mins left on my pot, I decided to keep going until it wore off and got a second one about 10 mins later. At least I have it for both of my 60 chars now and won't have to worry about the other chars for a while. I think the random number generator being used is seriously unbalanced.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was helping a freind do the quest under the dock, because he kept getting killed by the mobs that come out of the crates. So while I'm waiting for him to run back from the GY, I open one, and there's the Big Iron Fishing Pole. I guess now I'll have to get his fishing up. It's great because it doesn't bind, and I can give it to another alt or sell it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got some good money on the ah selling one of these, unfortunately i didn't realize i'd create a new charecter who fished... Got one on about the 5th trap.</div>

If they do, I know how I'm getting my elite mount.<br /><br />Aggro range is a little ridiculous, I'm level 60 I should have to swim through the guys to aggro them.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hand in a set of five shellfish to Jinar'Zillen, who is standing on the dock in Shadowprey. He'll give you a bloodbelly fish in return. Completing the &quot;Catch of the Day&quot; quest, which is obtained in Ghost Walker Post in central Desolace, requires two of these fish.<br /><br />Anyhow, after about an hour and a half this morning, I received my fishing pole at the coords 21, 81.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I ventured in from Shadowprey thinking i was going to be there hours and planing on it too, killed just 45 crawlers and 53 pincers before picking my last crate which contained this beauty.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm beginning to think it's all a big lie. Spent 1/2 a level trying to get this. =( No luck. =( At least I'm getting xp's off the kills ... gonna try a bit longer and then just give up. =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this is a damn joke ive had 2 greens drop from these crates (both of which are ~0.1%) 4 of the rusty engineering parts (which are the SAME drop rate as the pole) and like 10 of each of the other drops (boots etc) not to mention well over 100 damn shellfish. im apprihensive as to whether the pole still actually drops...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So I make something to eat and grab a 6 pack, then sit back and prepare for a LONG farming session to get ahold of one of these. I land and jump in the water and head for the nearest trap. Pop it open and... viola, first trap gives me the pole. Consider me one happy fisherman.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can't bleieve my luck, got it at attempt nº 3 :)<br />As soon as I have time I'll get another to sell @ AH</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me 2 hours to find 1 pole. i'm not on a pvp server, nor am i alliance, so i had no problem as a lvl 44 taking out the 35 mobs. they were very annoying, and after about 200 shellfish and over 100 traps later, i finally got one. there is no particular trap this drops from. it's all chance. a very low chance. some people say they get them quickly, but i'd say that mine is just about the right drop rate. don't go into this with an extra 10 minutes one time. you have to have time to spend doing this. and again, mobs aren't hard, just annoying, especially when i feared them and the water became one gigantic moving mass of mobs all coming for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>That took so long but I got it in the end, 2 hours it took. I forgot to bring swimming or underwater breathing but found a spot where could swim from the air bubbles to the 3 traps.<br /><br />5 and 1/2 bars for XP killing them Drysnap Crawlers and pals, so while it was boring I guess it all helps towards the next lvl.<br /><br />One thing, when you do get it, don't do what I done and forget you still have to breath ;-) almost died after I got it. Time I got it was 19:40 game time not sure if that helps anyone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got one in the 5th or 6th trap for me, and while im there i grind, so i guess ill pull about 1-2 in an hour, then lvl every once i a while, great farming place</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The fisherman on the docks allows you to turn in 5 shellfish for 55s.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>An hour and a half so far, I figured I should post to increase my luck.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well i only farmed about 30min before my first one then an hour and a half of nothin went to mc ... came back 20min into farmming found one then another in the next crate ... then 30min after that found another one lol ... i think i'm lucky</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay, so I decided to try to get one... I found a nice little air fissure that had a couple traps continually respawning right next to it. I was there for probably about 10 minutes when I got my first one. About 20 or so minutes later (give or take just a couple minutes) I got my second one. This was all while repeatedly killing a pretty inept Tauren Druid that just wouldn't stay away from me... I'd use Hunter's Mark to warn him off, and he'd just keep coming. Anyway, got 2 of these in probably half an hour or so, more or less. Thinking of going for more for AH bait. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As many of u has noticed the magnificent fishing pole is dropping in price.<br />The explanation is simple - It's not soulbound - so number of fishing poles just keep increasing.<br />bdw the big iron fishing pole is a very good 2h when u got 300 fishing skill.</div>

My plan was to go and find a fissure that was right beside where a trap spawned.(I used 19.00,77.61) I looted the trap, moved to the fissure so i wouldn't drowned and then waited for the trap to repawn, then loot, and repeat. I timed the first 20 traps just to get an idea of the respawn timer, shortest time was 1 minute and 13 seconds, longest time was 2 minutes and 52 seconds. <br /><br />in the 70 traps I got <br /><br />1 green boot<br />7 grey boots<br />1 grey cog<br />72 shellfish<br />1 big iron pole<br /><br />just keep trying!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Struk</b></h3>So here we go again. If you haven't played classic before then with the exception of the pole from the competition in Booty Bay this is the best pole you will get on Alliance side.<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Location:</b> Desolace</li><li><b>Coordinates:</b> In and around 20,80</li><li><b>Looking for:</b> <a href="/classic/object=176582/shellfish-trap">Shellfish Trap</a></li><li><b>Aids:</b> <a href="/classic/item=5996/elixir-of-water-breathing">Elixir of Water Breathing</a></li><li>There is Bubble outlets on the seabed to avoid repeatedly swimming to the surface.</li></ul><br /><br />Easy enough farming rotation, respawn rate of the traps is few minutes at most.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MoonVoW</b></h3>Back in Vanilla, we farmed these to raise funds for our mounts. For nostalgia, we returned to so the same now, found everything the same, but we cannot get any of the cages to open. Has it been changed? We don't remember exactly what we did as Alliance Druids - except dying a *lot* doing this. I've read all through several threads like this one that talk about drop rates and patterns but not about specifically what to do to open them or if it has changed. Thoughts? Directions? Grateful for links to conversations I have missed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vile</b></h3>Spent about 2.5 hours farming traps, unlike the 5-6 bots that were there for 14+ hours. 175 shellfish, 2 green boots, and I junked the greys due to bag space. 0 fishing poles.<br /><br />The bots really suck the fun out of these. There were so many, my friend and I could barely do the quest ONCE earlier because we don't have swim speed potions or anything and the bots did (3 were Druids though). They would swim right in front of us and take them, then go back to the exact locations to sit and wait for cage respawns. We did get the quest done, and I was trying to find the pole for my friend during my farm because he was really excited about it.<br /><br />He's a BRAND new player so the whole bot thing was really disappointing to him. We will have to watch the AH for the overpriced ones or wait till Hinterlands.<br /><br />I know it's just a fishing pole, but you kind of want the new people to enjoy the game. I do anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>squiretoad</b></h3>Three full hours (I counted the breathing potions), and nada, zip, zilch. Oh, lots of useless lobsters (I'm Alliance, hardly worth throwing them away), a few other drops and a silver or so from the big lobster NPCs I'm killing, but damn all for fishing rods. Bah, useless. I'd have done spending 12G in the AH and rewarding some more patient soul. Lesson learned, bah.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>balmora90</b></h3>Took me a $%^&amp;ing 314 tries to finally get this one in SoM, was a really painful grind seeing how many boots dropped meanwhile (the ones on 3% chance) and i also got 3 junk parts (1% chance) + well over 200 shellfishes that sold for 35g on BB AH. Statistically you have around 67% chance to get it if u open 100 traps but oh well, odds are odds.<br /><br />Worth mentioning that the price of this rod is around 50g on the biggest server in SoM right now, so thats actually a decent way to potentially get some gold if u have patience. It's also not BoP so if u somehow upgrade it in fishing contest u can safely resell it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>njry</b></h3>To anyone attempting a Big Iron Fishing Pole farm in the SoD 25 level bracket:<br /><br />- be ready for a painful, slow, dangerous grind<br />- the gold reward from turning in the shellfish was removed, so that will reduce more incentive to do this, but i found the fish reward vendor price was able to cover my repairs<br />- if you are not undead or warlock using underwater breathing, you WILL want underwater breathing potions<br />- before you approach traps, plan your escape route<br />- not every trap can be looted without aggroing the nearby makrura patrols but most can if you wait for them to patrol far enough away<br />- putting a marker on the nearby makrura patrols can help you in gauging aggro distance before you go in to loot. i would also recommend an addon like 'rangedisplay'.<br />- get as far away as you can from the trap while still able to click it<br />- if the trap spawns a makrura, there is a brief moment after spawn where it can't aggro and you can use this to stealth, or blink away sometimes and make enough distance to not aggro.<br />- the spawned makrura is not going to be killable, just run<br />- use every defensive tool your class has and as much armor, health and possibly frost resistance you have available. if you do not strafe move so as to not present them your back, they will daze you and almost certainly kill you, so only use strafe movement to run away.<br />- as a mage i made sure to use frost armor, arcane int, dampen magic (for frost shock), mana shield and blink. regeneration chest rune could be used to heal when i get low after breaking aggro while still in water<br />- i found the spawned makrura would be despawned by the time i looped around again to the trap that spawned it.<br />- i'm probably 2+ hours in with no drop so like i said, this will not be fun.<br /><br />Happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eggsnbacey</b></h3>Definitely took me just under 4 hours but I finally got it. When you first enter the water from the path down there's two shellfish traps that are relatively shallow, straight ahead from there and a bit deeper is a bubbly fissure you can get air from. Surrounding that bubbly fissure is 3 more shellfish traps. You can grind these 5 traps efficiently without waiting for the traps to respawn and without having to use underwater breathing elixers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MDurm</b></h3>Just a little tip for anyone farming.<br /><br />At 19.11, 81.31 there is a bubbly air fissure between two traps. You can chill here between the two traps and the respawn is super quick. Probably less than a minute after you've looted both. It was the quickest way I found.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>metroboomkin</b></h3>Snagged the pole after freeing 247 shellfish and a pile of boots and sandals.<br /><br />As others have mentioned....<br /><br />It will be in the last trap you search.<br /><br />Use underwater breathing spell or potions for ease. <br /><br />Bubbly fissures near the traps at the bottom of the underwater canyons provide air to breathe, so consider that as an option if you're running low on o2. <br /><br />After circling the area a few times (hopefully you'll find it with haste and wont need to) you will develop a feel for the respawn times and locations and find an efficient strategy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Artora</b></h3>Context regarding this fishing pole for <b>Alliance</b> players, this is by far the best fishing pole in Classic when it comes to difficulty versus quality ratio.<br />The boost is 4x stronger than that of the <a href="/classic/item=6365/strong-fishing-pole">Strong Fishing Pole</a> (+20 fishing versus +5 fishing). The only upgrade for Alliance players is the <a href="/classic/item=19970/arcanite-fishing-pole">Arcanite Fishing Pole</a>, which requires you to win the Stranglethorn Vale Fishing Extravaganza.
