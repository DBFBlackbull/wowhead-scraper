<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I find it extremely useful for mining.&nbsp; If you zoom in with it, you can look for minerals much better.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances, you can only &quot;see&quot; minerals near you.&nbsp; When you use the spyglass, you field of vision increases, and you can detect minearals much further away.&nbsp; Excellent for when you are scouting out new areas too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>While it does break stealth, this is sometimes an invaluable tool for scouting out BG targets or alerting people to incoming. Not just how many, but what and who in particular without targeting. <br /><br />A good guild that can secure a vantage point, say the Mills for instance, can alert the BS, Mine and Stables/Farm to who is incomming and if reinforcements are needed. <br /><br />Alternatively, in the case of a zerg on any of the aforementioned, you can signal when your other groups should come up behind the line and disrupt the clothies.</div>

We were out of sight range, but could see them using spyglasses. 60's rode off, we'd come helter-skelter down the mountain and kill our victim again, leaving them all mystified as to how we knew...<br /><br />Also, useful to see if the other faction is camping the meetingstone before you get there. It WILL extend your sight 'range'.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This thing is godly for a priest.<br />Simply use it. use /target on whoever you want to find, then hit mind vision. saves a ton of time looking for someone or even enemy players. i can spy on corpses from a long distance.<br />You dont need to be an engineer to use it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you go into the main courtyard of Dire Maul, where the free-for-all pvp arena is, you will see several High Elf statues in various poses. On the Archer elf (third from the left, nearest to DM West entrance), you can use the Ornate Spyglass to view him, and you will see a smiley face on his belt buckle.<br /><br />These statues also periodically sparkle with a gold sparkles. You can sometimes see the sparkles without the spyglass, but the sparkles are easily visible with the Ornate Spyglass. <br /><br />Other eggs in WoW are listed on <a href="https://www.blizzplanet.com" rel="nofollow">www.blizzplanet.com</a><br /><br />Edited, Mon Jan 30 17:02:06 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This can be used by non-engineers. <br /><br />And yep, it does magnify things. You can target things, too although most will be outside any ranged attacks.<br /><br />It does not work with Eagle Eyes. I tried cast it and the effect broke. I think that any spell/ability use will break the effect (too bad).<br /><br />All in all, a silly but possibly useful toy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes, it's reuseable</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if ur fast enough as a hunter or shaman u can get eagle eyes or farsite off...in AB this can be used to acctualy view the opening move of the other side and if your group listens u can use it to your advantage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This item can actually serve a practical use.<br /><br />One day while levelling in STV, a mini-war was started near Nessingwary's (where else would one be? :) ). After the intial frantic mayhem, we horde regrouped on the graveyard side of the river, while the alliance regrouped on the Nessy side. I couldn't see them from the distance we were, and a few people also noted that they could not. So I whip out the Spyglass, and it does actually render further then what you would normally see.<br /><br />Not sure if this would be feasable in many situations (Battlegrounds?) but I do know that I'll always have it on me.<br /><br />I swear engineering is going to be the reason that I most likely won't be able to afford my mount when I hit 40.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone know if the spyglass is reusable? Or does it disappear after one use?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's more of a silly item than a useful item. Good for zooming in on dancing night elf females. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What this item does is basically work just like a telescope. You go into first person view, but very zoomed in, and you can see objects/mobs/players from a further distance than usual.<br /><br />People keep saying this is silly. Why's it silly? It's pretty damn useful.<br /><br />You know the whole I-can-see-you-but-you-can't-see-me principle.<br /><br />It's very useful in contested territory if you're not a shaman (farsight) or a hunter (eagle eyes). If you think there are enemy players nearby, you can whip out your spyglass and take a look around. You can see them to see what they're doing and where they are, but they can't see you. You can select things from that range, yes, but once you've put away the spyglass again, if they're outside your usual vision range, they'll be deselected.<br /><br />Edit: Made a part of my post a little clearer.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 27th 2006 at 7:59am EDT by Axidos</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I assume this works much like the hunter ability Eagle Eye, but that's usable only outdoors and this does not mention that. So I'm wondering if it's usable indoors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It'd be so damn nice if you could use it mounted as it would help tremendously in many situations but it's still good. Still wish I could use this to scout a pvp situation on my mount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this is great device and extremely usefull for people with gathering professions. when you use this, your track abilities/professions will see FURTHER on minimap, i use this all the time to see inside mines without ever going close, just look in direction and clicky, you can track things about twice as far as normal, in direction you are facing. if you are tracking demons, you can clicky this and detect demons twice as far in front of you on the minimap, its same for anything you track, humans, beasts, plants, veins. it DOES NOT require engineering to use, and has NO lvl requirement! if you want one, get moss agate and find an engineer, other things to make it ussualy arent a concern, the moss agate is one of the gems that isnt common. you can also use this to obviously see far away, but you can see mobs/targets further away then normal, so long as there isnt a fog or such in the way, you cannot see through those.<br /><br />Edited, Tue May 3 12:02:25 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Quench</b></h3>I was recently hiding from some Horde in EPL when I decided to test out some numbers with this on a banshee NPC. These numbers are nowhere perfect, because the NPC ran around in one place a bit and I grabbed these coords pretty hastily, but I decided to do this just to have a small idea on the distance of this item.<br /><br />I wrote down the coords of the Banshee, when I could use my 10 yd spell, when I last could see the banshee before it faded into the distance, and when I could last see the banshee in the distance while using a spyglass. Then I used the coords to find the difference between them and the banshee coordinates. With the differences I could calculate the difference of 1 yd and use it to measure the distance in yds.<br /><br /><b>Banshee Target Coords</b><br />73.1, 31.5<br /><br /><b>10 Yard Spell Coords</b><br />73.2, 31.2<br /><b>10 Yd Spell Distance Difference</b><br />0.31622776601683793319988935444327‬<br /><br /><b>Max View Distance Coords</b><br />74.2, 28.7<br /><b>Max View Distance Difference</b><br />3.008321791298265‬<br /><br /><b>Ornate Spyglass Distance Coords</b><br />75.2, 24.4<br /><b>Ornate Spyglass Distance Difference</b><br />7.4040529441651077377798893434632‬<br /><br /><b>1 Yd would be a tenth of the 10 yd spell distance.</b><br />0.03162277660168379331998893544433‬<br /><br /><b>Max View Distance:</b> Over 95 yds<br /><b>Ornate Spyglass Distance:</b> Over 234 yds<br /><br />If anybody got better measurements, I'd like to know! I'm sure I'm off by yds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Muherus</b></h3>This item increases the range at which your combat log detects enemies. Very useful in the open world, and in battlegrounds.</div>

        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
