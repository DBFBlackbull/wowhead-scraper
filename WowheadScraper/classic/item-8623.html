If he agros the random mobs or the &quot;event&quot; mobs then you fight. Half the time though he will run right past them and the mobs will never get an attack off and you can avoid most of your fights.<br /><br />Also if you run ahead fighting mobs there's an even chance the escortee won't join you so he ends up running to far ahead and you fail the quest anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Strangly.. a Sprite darter in Feralas dropped this. The quest started by this Item is very difficult to do alone, I reccommend a group or if you are level 50+ you should be ok.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>corners</b></h3>Makes sure your group turns in the first part of this quest. Otherwise one of you will be standing there unhappy when the escort starts and you weren't on the right part if it because you never turned in the first part before accepting and starting the escort.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xLunacyx</b></h3>At one point you'll get ganked by 3 lv48 scorpions. They can be very tough if you're on the lower side of levels. Getting time to drink water for mana can be tough as well, you'll have time to drink while it fights one of the many mobs on the pathway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>blizzard60</b></h3>Item to begin the questline found on a sandfury shadowhunter in the zul'farrak dungeon at /way 45, 61 behind the walls walking around in an area at the foot of the mountains. I'm sure this was random, so KILL EVERYTHING! GL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Squeej</b></h3>Niche piece of info for anyone trying to get this to drop...<br />I was trying to get this on my level 50 hunter on SoD via GY / Scarab runs. <br /><br />I did six runs under these conditions: <br />- In a party with my second account (the second toon was not in the instance)<br />- Loot was set to FFA<br />- Second account toon had the Beacon in their bags already<br /><br />Not a single chicken dropped in these six runs<br /><br />I switched loot method to Group Loot and kept the other conditions the same and on my next run THREE chickens dropped from one clear. <br /><br />Could be insanely good or bad RNG, or the drop could be tied to something weird like loot method. /shrug</div>
