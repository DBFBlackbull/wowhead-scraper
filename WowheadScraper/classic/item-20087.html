<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Most creeps in a mixed area, an area with various creatures or the same kind with different names, share spawn points.<br /><br />In other words, kill only wavethrashers, and a turtle, makura, or murloc may spawn in it's place as well, virtually wiping out wavethrashers.<br /><br />Kill everything in the area they are in: turtles, murlocs, makura, and the thrashers... and you will notice them spawning more often...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Good spot is 87,26.<br /><br />Farthest Northeast Beach..jagged reef.. believe <br /><br />near bitter ridge.<br /><br />On map its north of the phallic looking peninsula.<br /><br />Its the only place u can ride down to the beach from the NorthEast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I agree about the location, great place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can find plenty of Wavethrashers on the eastern coast of Azshara, instead of jumping off the cliff or swimming around.&nbsp; Coords 85,19-27.&nbsp; I found all 6 scales within a matter of minutes from the spawn there.&nbsp; Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I highly recommend using Hydrocane or some other type of underwater breathing and swimming around the peninsula mentioned here (Tower of Eldara).&nbsp; There are a ton of Wavethrashers in the water.&nbsp; I collected my scales quickly this way.&nbsp; Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Going up along coast to those cordinates proved nice idea.<br />Got loads of stuff and more wavetrashers then ever before<br />and more fun murlocs to hurt</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is in Tower of Eldara/Jagged Reef area (NE shoreline).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sorry, double post.&nbsp; The drop rate itself wasn't all that bad up there, and I wasn't competing to get them.&nbsp; Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The hydrcoane proving its worth once again :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yet another of Blizzard's cruel jokes, a.k.a. &quot;the Timesink Quest&quot; or &quot;Kill-Ten-Thousand-Mobs-For-Six-Drops&quot; quest.&nbsp; I've killed 20 of these things so far with 1 scale drop.&nbsp; The vast majority of these wavethrashers are indeed underwater.&nbsp; The fact that you can't &quot;eat&quot; or &quot;sit&quot; while swimming further exacerbates the crappiness of this quest.&nbsp; <br /><br />This quest is a bit less pointless than, say, spending $15 a month to catch imaginary fish...but not by much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just did this quest last night, and I've found that the Younger Wavethrashers are the best. I killed about 10, and got all my scales. Finding them, might be a problem. I swam from the eastern tip of the coast, all the way around to where the continent connects with Winterspring, and found maybe 6 of them or so, but on the way back, I found a few more and killed them. Every single one I killed dropped a scale.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>14 Kills 1 Drop x_X</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>About 20 thrashers so far and 5 scales of course last 5&nbsp; havnt had em :( still looking</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I helped a friend get these scales, and we killed about 20, no scales. I left the party, and they started to drop. Killing them in melee seems to do the trick. Didn't have the pet either, but not sure if that helped the droprate. Dunno if you can't be in party, but i basically killed thm all when in party. I guess you just have to drop them without help is all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, Melle the Wavethrasher. Drop chances increases. I killed around 10 with range, droped 1. I killed around 7 melle drop other 5.<br />The trick is Start the fight melle. Then let the pet take agro. Try not to range. <br />I dont no why but found it easier to kill when melle. <br />Dont forget to use Feign Dead in case you have low HP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After swimming around the Bay of Storms killing wavethrashers and getting one scale, I headed up towards the Tower of Eldarra as others have suggested.&nbsp; I took my other 5 scales in less than 10 minutes up there.<br /><br />If you see a&nbsp; lot of murlocs, turtles, and other mobs, try killing off some of those and hope for wavethrashers on the respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>LoL I cant even find them at all... :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're like me, you like to at least start the quest and grind and *!@#, before you resort to Thottbot.<br /><br />Bad idea, in this case.<br /><br />Listen to the other posters, and go North of the Tower of Eldara.<br /><br />In fact, go up there to let's say 88,17, and hit up the YOUNG Wavethrashers.<br /><br />They dropped it at a MUCH higher rate than teh regular Wavethrashers.<br /><br />I killed maybe 20 Wavethrashers to get my first 3 of the Q item, and I had to kill just 5 YOUNG Wavethrashers to get the last 3 Q items.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I must have been ungodly lucky. I got 6 out of 11 kills...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lornelawson.com/wavethrashers.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.lornelawson.com/wavethrashers.JPG</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>man this sucks ive killed over 12 and only gotten 2 then i found like a herd of them and i kill them (there were 7) and i only got 1 wave scale is there any certian way to kill them please help<br />HUNTER IN NEED</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is getting old fast :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This drop rate can only be described in one-way: ABYSMAL...1 in 14 as my average drop rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I hate this quest i have killed 24 wavelashers now and not one scale has dropped im goin right where everyone says but they just wont drop</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I start feeling like a submarine now with a very bad supply of oxygen to go sub-merged. Speed also feels like I'm on some patrol exercise. First person view increases the realism. This imagination I guess is the only way to stay sane while swimming the endless coast in search for the scales. And it's not really like they're many in one location.<br /><br />I started the sea patrol by traveling out to the flight platform for the runes quest killing some treshers en-route. An observation was that the Greater Wavetreshers seem to drop the scales more frequently than the normal and young treshers (I got&nbsp; 2 in 4 kills I think).<br /><br />Smart as I thought I was I made the patrol go back to the quest NPC because I thought I would get these drops on the way back. But no, endless line of killed treshers was leading me all the way up on the northern coast and I was starting to run out of patience.<br /><br /><b>Summary:</b> You'll need a lot of patience on this part of the quest chain, but it isn't half as pathetic as the Antler quest before this one. And don't do my mistake, go for the Greater Wavetreshers and remain in these waters (southern coastline).<br /><br />These monsters are mainly a bit deeper into the water, so you have to be a bit out in the water.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>these things cant be better than a 10% drop rate at best =/ that thing has to be wrong</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Young Wavethrashers probably drop the most scales, i killed about 25 of the Wavethrashers and gave up on them, but when i started killing the young ones, I got 3 in 5 minutes :) Gluck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I recomend killing the Young Wavethrasher's as well. Drop rate was great (much better than those antlers..) took me no more than fifteen minutes :) Plus got a gold pearl and a black pearl in the mix. <br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Edited, Tue Feb 28 20:18:20 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found the Young Wavethrasher easier too kill. There was about 1000 more of them than the Greater ones. They're north. Just look at the map. they are also easier too kill. It took me 10 minutes too get all 6. But when I tried the greater ones it took half an hour without success</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Only thing i found at 49.8 was tortoises, that was it :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>go to the very eastern coasts line and don't swim at all. If you swim you are going to be pissed off in no time because this quest sucks that way. There are a lot of reg wavethrashers on the beach on the eastern tip / coast.</div>
