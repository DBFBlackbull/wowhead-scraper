If you try to calculate the extra damage you will get dissapointed.\n\nThe Rank 9 gives 15 more damage on a backstab. Easy to see.\nNow if you have the Oppertunity talent you supposedly get 20% extra damage\n15*1.20 = 18 Damage\n\nSo 18 Damage more on a Non Crit backstab with the best possible talents. This is if the Oppertunity talent adds to this damage wich it looks like it does not.\n\nWith a Critical backstab you can get a bit more from this 15 start damage. Lets Calculate the maximum damage with best possible talents. Oppertunity and Lethality. Lethality gives you 130% crit bonus where you normally get 100% crit bonus.\nThe 18 damage from normal Oppertunity backstab with the 130% crit bonus\n18*2.3 = 41.4 Damage\n\nSo with the best possible build you will maximum get 41 more damage on your critical backstabs.\n\nBut honestly it looks like Oppertunity only works on the weapon damage and not the +210\/+225 extra. You can actually see the tooltip change from +150% weapon damage to +180% weapon damge when you put points in oppertunity but the +210\/+225 stays the same.

Thus it is not 180% + 225dmg, it is 180% + 270dmg(multiplied by 1.2 for the +20% from 5\/5 opportunity).\n\nHis formula for backstab criticals are as follows,\n\n[Weapon DMG + (AP * 1.7\/14) * 1.5 * 1.2 + 270rank9 or 252rank8)] * 2.3 = Damage done.\n\nIf you are a math newbie like myself, complete whats in the ( brackets ) first, then start from left going to the right in the [ brackets ] and finish by multiplying by 2.3 . \n\nUsing Perditions Blade with +5dmg enchanted and the Might of Cenarius ring +4dmg. With an attack power of 701 I will show you the math as I understand it.\n\n[146 + (701 * 1.7\/14) * 1.5 * 1.2 + 270] * 2.3 = 1578 High-end Backstab damage.\n\nNow i'll save you the extra math I did when keeping the dagger value the same and upping my attack power.\n\nIt goes like this, at 700 AP my high-end damage is&nbsp; 1578.\nAt 800 AP my high-end damage is 1628.\nAt 900 AP my high-end damage is 1678.\nAt 1000 AP my high-end damage is 1728.\n\nNotice the trend? for every 100 AP added my high end backstab gains 50 damage.\n\nAnd in case you're wondering, my high-end damage with rank8 backstab at 700 AP is 1536.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Omg! This totally rocks!<br /><br />I'm guessing it will drop on A'Q... Or else, we'd have something about the drops here in thottbot.<br />Can anyone confirm this?<br /><br />The dmg increment from the previous backstab is indeed only 15. But after the maths... I wonder if those +210 are summed with the damage after the attack power factoring in, or before the factor does multiply... Because a Backstab of +225 (increase of 15 dmg) sounds pretty dull if that's just a sum after all.<br /><br />From the description I assume it works like this:<br /><br />Let's use Barman Shanker as example, for the sake of popularity.<br />Weapondamage: 51-95 (Damagerange) <br />Attackpowerbonus: ((Your AP)/14)*1.7 (normalized value 4 daggers) <br />Backstab bonus: (Weapondamage * 1.5) +Attackpowerbonus+210 <br /><br />Assume AP is 700: (Agility+Strength and equip and stuff)<br /><br />Backstab (rank 8):<br />(51-95 * 1.5) + ((700/14) * 1.7) + 210 = <br />76.5-142.5 + 85 + 210 = 371-580<br /><br />Backstab (rank 9):<br />(51-95 * 1.5) + ((700/14) * 1.7) + 225 = <br />76.5-142.5 + 85 + 210 = 386-595<br /><br />I wonder how much that crits for, especially if you have those talents that increase the damage of the attacks from behind including backstab and ambush, and the talent that increases crit damage bonus! ^^<br />Don't know how those bonuses account for this...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This book is a joke from Blizzard. If you try to calculate the extra damage you will get dissapointed.<br /><br />The Rank 9 gives 15 more damage on a backstab. Easy to see.<br />Now if you have the Oppertunity talent you supposedly get 20% extra damage<br />15*1.20 = 18 Damage<br /><br />So 18 Damage more on a Non Crit backstab with the best possible talents. This is if the Oppertunity talent adds to this damage wich it looks like it does not.<br /><br />With a Critical backstab you can get a bit more from this 15 start damage. Lets Calculate the maximum damage with best possible talents. Oppertunity and Lethality. Lethality gives you 130% crit bonus where you normally get 100% crit bonus.<br />The 18 damage from normal Oppertunity backstab with the 130% crit bonus<br />18*2.3 = 41.4 Damage<br /><br />So with the best possible build you will maximum get 41 more damage on your critical backstabs.<br /><br />But honestly it looks like Oppertunity only works on the weapon damage and not the +210/+225 extra. You can actually see the tooltip change from +150% weapon damage to +180% weapon damge when you put points in oppertunity but the +210/+225 stays the same. So if Oppertunity does not add to the extra damage the formula is.<br /><br />15*2.3 = 34.5 Damage<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ====<br />Like I said. Its a joke from Blizzard. The diffrence between rank 7 and rank 8 backstab is 45 base damage. from rank 8 to 9 only 15 :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well all I know is I got this and it is nice. My backstab crits are hitting for around 100-150 more. It's pretty sweet that I was the first rogue on the server with it (dropped off of AQ20 first boss, who is a pushover) With backstab talents my lobotomizer hits for about 1000 avg backstab. So, eh, not bad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i wish this was ambush instead :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Going on Brogetta's calculations for backstab criticals I will explain as best I can for others.<br /><br />For starters, when people see the 150% + 225 damage they are forgetting that Lethality is applied to the critical bonus and thus it becomes 180% + 225 damage if you have 5/5 +30% in Lethality.<br /><br />Secondly, in Brogetta's testing he believes that Opportunity is also added throughout the equation. Thus it is not 180% + 225dmg, it is 180% + 270dmg(multiplied by 1.2 for the +20% from 5/5 opportunity).<br /><br />His formula for backstab criticals are as follows,<br /><br /> * 2.3 = Damage done.<br /><br />If you are a math newbie like myself, complete whats in the ( brackets ) first, then start from left going to the right in the and finish by multiplying by 2.3 . <br /><br />Using Perditions Blade with +5dmg enchanted and the Might of Cenarius ring +4dmg. With an attack power of 701 I will show you the math as I understand it.<br /><br /> * 2.3 = 1578 High-end Backstab damage.<br /><br />Now i'll save you the extra math I did when keeping the dagger value the same and upping my attack power.<br /><br />It goes like this, at 700 AP my high-end damage is&nbsp; 1578.<br />At 800 AP my high-end damage is 1628.<br />At 900 AP my high-end damage is 1678.<br />At 1000 AP my high-end damage is 1728.<br /><br />Notice the trend? for every 100 AP added my high end backstab gains 50 damage.<br /><br />And in case you're wondering, my high-end damage with rank8 backstab at 700 AP is 1536. A difference of 42 high-end damage upgrading from Rank 8 to Rank 9 for myself.<br /><br />Hope this post clears up your questions or concerns regarding the new rank of backstab.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since I have improved Ambush and improved backstab, I could kill a mage with Ambush + Backstab and maybe eviscerate, if I have this I can kill priests with it too.<br /><br />This crits for about 1000-1100 against against cloth with a reasonable lvl 60 blue dagger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the reason it says 180% instead of 150% is because of opportunity, which adds 20% more wep dmg, and guess what 20% of 150 is? thats right 30%. so its not lethality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>+15 damage is like adding 123 attack power to Backstab, and this isn't a ring or a trinket thats an equipment slot. Nor unlike other classes, using this backstab still costs 60 energy, while other class books cost more mana to cast. This item is amazing. Stfu please.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why do you get +30% in your tooltip of backstab (being 180% finally) with 5/5 in opportunity if that say +20% on backstab, garrote and ambush.<br /><br />And i have only the 5 points on opportunity and i dont have lethality.<br /><br />Why?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is something that takes up ZERO item slots, is always on, and will always add damage to a BS.&nbsp; As a rogue I want to be inflicting every bit of damage I can.&nbsp; I my normal attack I can usually get off 3 to 4 BS on a target.. that's 45 to 60 more damage just from BS.&nbsp; That might not sound like much, but it's been the difference between life and death a few times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Our guilds first success on Buru this dropped, of 4 rogues only 3 were dagger, crazy ass rolls: 20 mans are off DKP<br />rogue1:98<br />rogue2:5 (lol)<br />rogue3:98<br /><br />rogue1:89<br />rogue3:89<br /><br />rogue1:94<br />rogue3:<b>95</b><br /><br />The lucky rogue 3 was me!<br />15/28/5 combat build for max. BACKSTAB dmg already, so I'll be using this well regarless if its only 15dmg more. Current dagger is from 1st boss in AQ20, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Qiraji%20Sacrificial%20Dagger">Qiraji Sacrificial Dagger</a> Everything adds up, I'm always #1 2 or 3 on the dmg meters during MC runs, 4% to crit from items, 6% to hit and 310 daggers = the bigger the boss the more damage I do comparatively (perfect for levelling 60+ :))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So wait.. does this drop during the world event?<br /><br />If so, that would mean only one rogue on every server would ever be able to learn Backstab 9, right?<br /><br />That'd be something to brag about..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just Got it Tonight, Increases damage of weapon by 180% and adds 225 damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This dropped for a guild team in AQ about a month ago and i passed on it so another dagger weilding rogue could have it (I am a sword weilding rogue - or was). One month later and i now have a decent dagger and i'm kicking myself for not even rolling on this. I thought they'd be common but they seem rare. Judging by the damage now done by the guy who got the book it is clearly a very worthwhile addition for any rogue - i.e. the extra damage makes a noticable difference. It's basically like a permanent +15 enchant to a weapon for the purposes of backstab stabbing (though not to white damage obviously) - add that to your +5 actual enchant and your +8 dense grinding stone = a LOT of pain dished out with backstabs. Enough to make me re-think being a sword rogue if i ever got hold of this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>We got this off the first boss in AQ last night, first on our server (hordeside) to kill him. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm psyched that there are some new skill upgrades,, but this doesnt quite add up. The damage bonus is only 15 more than rank 8,, when rank 8 is 45 more than rank 7. Why not just wait till the expansion, then give it a more balanced upgrade? Of course I'm gonna rush in and snag this as soon as the event is over and my server calms down, but I coulda settled for the other skills for now.</div>
