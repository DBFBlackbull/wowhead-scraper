Eye of Divinity - You get this by defeating Majordomo Executus in Molten Core, the final boss before Ragnaros.  When you defeat him he submits and you are able to loot his chest.  There is a 50% chance that it will contain the Eye of Divinity, otherwise it will hold the Ancient Petrified Leaf which is part of the hunter epic quest.  Majordomo is a difficult fight and you will need to be in an experienced raiding guild in order to defeat him.\n\n2.  Eye of Shadow - You can get this by farming high level elite demons in Winterspring or Blasted Lands.  You will need a group of people to farm these demons, and the Eye has a low drop rate (however it has increased significantly since the last patch).  Alternatively, you can kill Lord Kazzak in the Blasted Lands, a 40-man outdoor raid boss; he drops the Eye of Shadow 100% of the time.\n\n3.  Epic Quest Encounter - Finally, after you have both Eyes, you are ready to do the quest that will complete the staff.  This quest is done in the Eastern Plaguelands.  You must have the Eye of Divinity equipped in order to see the quest giver.  The quest involves protecting several waves of peasants from attacks as they travel from a cave to the quest giver.  The quest, while hard, is not overly difficult as long as you bring the right tools to the fight.  You can find guides on how to complete this quest from a number of sources.\n\nAs you can see, getting Benediction\/Anathema is no small task.  The biggest roadblock most will encounter is finding a guild that can defeat Majordomo; I've just recently joined a guild that has him on farm status, so it's just a matter of time as I wait for my turn to loot the Eye.  Other than that you could technically complete the rest solo and with pick-ups.  However, if this is not an option for you, don't fret.  There are a number of blue staves available that can fill the rolls of Benediction\/Anathema while you wait for your opportunity to get this great item.","date":"2006-10-30T01:01:57-06:00","rating":84,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"You can team up with other priests that are also on the quest and both do the quest at the same time.

The drop rate is not very rare. About 50\/50. It's either the eye or the hunter leaf.\r\n\r\nAfter those two have been obtained here are some tips for completing the quest:\r\n\r\nFirst supply yourself with plenty of oils of immolation, mana pots, mana regen food etc. If you can bring a few friends to come along for auras\/buffs.\r\n\r\nIF you happen to know another priest who is on the quest you can do it together (just be sure you dont heal each other or the qeust WILL fail). Equip the eye of divinity to see the NPC (she is located just west of the live entrance to strat). If you do not have the item equipped you will not be able to see her.\r\n\r\nThe quest involves saving 50 peasants before 15 die. Downranking will be a huge mana saver here because the peasants dont have very much life. Also keep your abolish disease handy because they will be inflicted with this as well.\r\n\r\nThe hardest part is being able to keep an eye on the peasants health because of some bug\/or on purpose you can no longer see their health bars above their heads. But if you are quick with the renewss\/abolish disease you should be golden.\r\n\r\nI have heard as long as the AOE'er does not move, a mage or warlock can stand at the mouth of the cave and kill the mobs that come through there as long as they DO NOT move.

Get really good at monitoring your cooldown timers and use them as effectively as you can. \r\n2. Don't use flash heal *most inefficient heal mana-wise* unless absolutely necessary. \r\n3. Dispell and choose your rank of renew on citizen's damage taken. \r\n4. Choose your gear with the most +heal and mana regen. \r\n5.

You can't save them all so if 1 or 2 die, don't worry too much.....don't get all stressed about it. \r\n\r\nThe point I got out of this quest is that you need to use your timers and available backup tools as best as you can. You also need to think about how efficient your mana use is. It's just like any raid really.

Gear\r\n\r\nYour effectiveness as a healer is highly dependent upon your gear. You want lots of intellect, spirit and +healing spell gear to maximize your healing potential when grouped. So if your particular talent build calls for different stats, consider carrying additional gear to equip whenever you're asked to be the primary healer. This is especially important for feral-specced druids, who prefer strength and stamina to intellect and spirit.\r\n\r\n2. Know who's expendable\r\n\r\nAll classes bring something unique to a group. And your ultimate goal is to keep everyone alive. But unfortunately, the roles that people play in your group are not all equal when it comes to expendability. Your priorities, listed from most important to least important, include the following roles, generally played by the following classes:\r\n\r\nYourself\r\nMain Tank (Should NEVER NEVER EVER be below 60% hp)\r\nOff Tank's\r\nMELEE DPS\r\nRanged DPS\r\n\r\nSo really when were throwing heals on mages\/locks and not on rogue's were screwing up. Mages\/Locks\/Hunters should never get hit nor healed as much as rogues. Not only can they bandage but they dont have to even back up because tey should be 30 yards away from the target. Note the llist does change with each different encounter like AOE encounters.\r\n\r\n3. Use efficient healing spells\r\nYour mana is your lifeline as a healer (and the lifeline of everyone else). So manage it carefully. Different spells will heal more efficiently when used on different classes and armor-types. This is governed by casting speed, type of heal and potency.\r\n\r\nRenew - Great HoT and unlike most heals doesnt gain aggro right away should ALWAYS be 1 on the tank.\r\n\r\nFlash Heal - If you cast 100 heals, 99 of them will be flash heals. This talent is the most effective when your tanks getting beat on for 1-2k per hit. Remember the tank usually only has about 6k life so ruffly 15% of his life gets taken away per hit, flash heal is usually faster then any attack of a boss and can counter act the dmg done and if crits can replenish the tanks health to full without a problem.\r\n\r\nGreater Heal - I can't stress enough DON'T use this unless you have innerfocus. This talent alltho does do alot of healing costs alot of mana and takes 3 seconds to cast. So unless your tanks at full and you can predict that hes ganna take X amount of dmg and needs a greater heal dont cast it. Stick with FLASH heal.\r\n\r\nPower Word: Shield - The single best talent a priest has. It's an instant cast spell that gives a buble that absorbs 1k dmg. This should always be on teh tank if he doesnt have 1 on already. The only time you wouldnt put it on right away is if its a mortal strike boss. At that point you need to wait for the mortal strike to hit and then bubble. For those of you that don't know what mortal strike is, It reduces healing by 50% and does a tremendous amount of damage. Note even after you bubble you should still be aware of the tanks health and if below 60% still spam heals on him.\r\n\r\n4. The smart way to panic\r\nAs good as you get at controlling your aggro, eventually you will have to deal with a mob or two that you just can't shake. Let's start with what NOT to do:\r\n\r\n1) Don't run away. When you run, the main tank (or off tank) has a much harder time pulling the offending mob(s) from you. Plus, you can't heal your party if you're on the move. Worse yet, you may inadvertently pull more mobs.\r\n\r\n2) Avoid healing yourself. This can begin a cycle of futility. The more you heal yourself, the more aggro you generate and the more health you'll lose to the attacker(s). Furthermore, the mob(s) attacking you will be increasingly harder for others to pull.\r\n\r\nSo what should you do? \r\n\r\n1) Use 'Fade' to reduce the aggro you've accumulated (as well as aggro you will accumlate) for 10 seconds. It can instantly free you of a mob or two and allow your tank the opportunity to pull mobs back to himself. And that means you can get back to healing.

Make your way toward the main tank (or off tank). The closer you are to him, the faster he will be able to pull the offending mob(s) from you.\r\n\r\n3) If Fade doesn't work and your tank's a bit late picking it up always Power Word: Shield And Renew. Both these are instant and you can run to the tank.\r\n\r\n4. Support your party\r\nAs the primary healer, you are the main part of your group. But don't just pay attention to healing. There are a few other things you can do to further support your party.\r\n\r\n1) Use mana potions. As stated above, your mana is the lifeline of everyone in your party. When you run out, you cannot heal. So always keep a stack of mana potions handy that are on par with your current level. In our case its combat pots or better.\r\n\r\n2) Let us know when your RUNNING out of mana. To many times in raids ppl have died because they say im oom instead of saying Im low on mana can I get some help healing.\r\n\r\n3) Decurse your party.

I did this with just reading and talking with folks, without seeing a video of what is to come. If you can, find a video beforehand so you know what to expect!\n\nIf you find yourself having a low mana pool, try to acquire some of these items before heading it:\n\nNightfin Soup (Mana regeneration for 10 minutes)\nMageblood Potion (More mana regeneration)\nDemonic \/Dark Runes (You can heal yourself the life back. Demonic are BoP and harder to get - Dark may be a bit expensive on different servers because of being a reagent in many things.)\n\nIf you want an easy way to wipe out the skeletons that do attack you, carry Oil of Immolations. A lot of priests have claimed to use 15-25 on their run, but I surprisingly used less than 10, with the thorns buff.\n\nThese buffs are very helpful as well:\nMark of the Wild (Obviously Druid)\nBlessing of Wisdom (Paladin)\nDivine Spirit (Priest - More spirit for regen)\nThorns (Druid - Saves you on having to spam Oils :D)\nBlessing of Kings (Paladin - but harder to find now because of their respec. I went without it)\nBlessing of Sanctuary (Paladin - also another nice buff but harder to find because of paladins. I went without it as well)\n\nYou can NOT have anyone in your party because of the risks that can happen. If you walk out of a paladin aura and walk back into it, you have outside help and will fail the quest. So partying up with a few paladins and a warlock is too much of a risk and will probably be nerfed anyways. The quest is to do it on your own anyways, so just stock up on buffs before the fight.\n\nA lot of folks find it easier to use the 'v' option in game - where you can see the peasants healthbars over their head. While it's hard when the skeletons are attacking, it's very useful to see who is going to drop down.\n\nUse low level renews and you barely will have to flash heal - but it's also a good idea to hotkey abolish disease. I had level 2, 3, 6 and 9 of renew - 9 for myself, 6 for when it was an emergency and 2-3 to normally heal the peasants.\n\nThere are about 6 waves of 10 peasants each - an estimated number. A lot of the people I have talked to say the first wave is crucial, but there are some waves I expierenced where I barely had to heal. Certain points in the quest come where Eris Havenfire (quest NPC) will heal you. I am not too sure if she gives you mana as well since I wasn't paying too much attention to her.\n\nWhen the skeletons come up to attack you, put up a power word: shield and cast a couple of Oil of Immolations. They have barely any HP, but you shouldn't focus on wanding them to death or whatever to save money - your focus should be on the peasants entirely! If you're low on mana, try to use potions or demonic runes \/ dark runes and just heal the life. If you can afford a respec and find yourself having difficulty killing them - holy nova them.\n\nYou don't have the time to cast normal or regular heals - heck, I barely even had time to cast flash heals. Once they are near Eris Havenfire, just cast a couple of low rank renews on the ones with low HP and move back to the cave for the next wave - once they have passed her, they are safe.\n\nThere will be archers positioned on top of the cave - don't try to kill them. It's a waste of your time and your mana.\n\nI took a video of my encounter and will probably upload it to filefront and post a link later for it, for those who are still frightened of the quest. :)\n\nGood luck!","date":"2006-01-10T02:00:53-06:00","rating":31,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Lymsleia","importedSubject":"Lots of advice."},{"commentv2":1,"number":27,"id":2698307,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"one thing i d like to add to the very useful hints above:\n\nthe first wave requires much more healing and curing than the following waves where you have to cocentrate much more on killing the skeletons and staying alive.\n\nSo use higher rank renews for the first wave and cast a renew right after the dispell. Head back early for the 2nd wave even when the bows are still firing. Every peasant probably has an active renew on him anyway and will survive. In doubt turn around to see if the 2nd wave has spawned. Drink a mana pot before you head back.\n\nFrom then on less healing is required. Just occasionally cast renew and cure desease when neccessary and focus on activating oil of immolation, self shield and heal yourself. Rather use healing pots - you should have enough mana, or use the felwood night dragons for mana.","date":"2006-02-15T14:00:53-06:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Sahreinem","importedSubject":"Benediction quest"},{"commentv2":1,"number":28,"id":2698317,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Streaming video for those who want a preview before they attempt the quest.\n\n[url=http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2a_MSJBEEog]http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2a_MSJBEEog[\/url]","date":"2006-02-15T14:00:53-06:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Kreamy","importedSubject":"Video"},{"commentv2":1,"number":29,"id":2698330,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"If you're in winterspring to get the eye of shadow anyway, go ahead and do the Yeti quest chain I think starts with \"Are we there Yeti\".

Look at the number of people that have completed this, you will soon be next on the list. Because of the 2 hour quest turn around, I worried and tried to strategize in the interim of each of the 8 times I tried this quest. \n\nThe most important thing I can suggest is keeping your hot keys just as they are, just a lower rank. Example: rank 6 or 7 Renew, rank 5 Holy Nova (if you have it), Cure Disease (NOT abolish), rank 5 Flash Heal. Having multiple ranks of each spell on your hot keys only serves confuse what you and your fingers are accustom to AND wastes time trying to figure out which spell is where. This is ultimately an exercise in time management, and to a lesser degree mana conservation. Have a Major Mana Potion handy, you will need at least 1, and if you pot early enough, you could use a second. \n\nThe first wave consists of curing diseases and throwing a HoT on the civilians. The second through fifth wave starts getting tricky: with multiple diseases it is most important that you cure the purple\/blue disease off and flash heal them, possibly even a renew. The people with the purple colored disease typically walk faster than the others and therefor MUST be cured and healed first. The green disease does much less damage and these people can be cured and renewed and left alone. \n\nHealing people will cause aggro on you (during the second to fifth waves of civilians) and this is where I came into the most trouble. In order to take minimal damgae, use PW: Shield & Defiler's Talisman (if you have) it to minimize the damgae YOU take. Adds will come in waves, Fear the first wave off you and keep curing disease. Use Defiler's Talisman first to allow the timer to reset (you'll use it again) and let the 2nd wave hit you a bit. Wait until you have 2-3 waves of adds on you before you use Strat Holy Water or EZ Thro Dynamtie II (both on the same timer), Oil of Immolation, or my best suggestion is Holy Nova rank 6; it kills them all in 1 hit and heals you a little - which you'll need at that point. \n\nOnce you get to the quest giver, leave the civilians be (if they are at 50% health they will be fine) and run to the next wave of people. Once you made it past the second wave, you will be fine; it's rinse and repeat at that point.\n\nHit <V> every few seconds to check people's health and to clear the screen to look for new diseases. An over head view makes it easy to tagert individuals with diseases.\n\nDo NOT forget to heal yourself, a simple renew between waves and a flash heal during adds should suffice. \n\nGear: I had +healing gear on, NOT +intl or +spir(which is completely useless). \n\nPots: 1 Major Mana Potion, 2 Oil of Immolation (I mostly used Holy Nova rank 5 in order to 1 shot them all). Did Not need anything from Un'Goro or Felwood. \n\nTake a breath before you start and do what you normally do in a group or raid: your best.

While you wait, you will try to strategize and you may get nervous.

Otherwise the big demon will show and kill him. I saw it;)\n\nOk so with all the previous posts, you know pretty much what will happen in this fight. Go see the video. It will give you a good idea of the challenge to come.\n\nTo get prepared for this fight:\n\n- Bring with you dark runes, oil of immolations, major mana potion, and if you can, crystal charges from Un'goro crater (these are stronger than EZ throw dynamite 2). Anything that can do damage without wasting your mana is ideal.\n\n- Drag in your shortcut bar Renew level 3 or 4. Don't use your highest Renew spell on the citizens, it would be a mana waste. You can also drag a lower level Flash heal in your bar to heal peasants.\n\n- Be prepared to use Power Word: Shield (lvl10) on yourself, and Psychim Scream on the melee undeads.\n\nThis fight is pretty intense, so organize your shortcuts wisely. \n\nKeep in mind these objectives and you will succeed:\n\n1- Cure diseases ASAP\n\n2- Use the \"v\" key wisely. It's ideal to see the health bar to heal, but if you try to select a peasant to cure his disease, you may find it difficult with all the health bars up. Click again on the \"v\" key to hide the health bars. You will have to hit on and off the \"v\" key constantly in this fight.\n\n3- Spam the Renew spell on the peasants. You may not use have to use Flash heals that much anyway; renews.\n\n4- As soon as you have around 60-70% of mana, take immediately a major mana potion. This way you should have the chance to take another one.\n\n5- When the melee undead comes on you, kill them ASAP. I saw that Holy Nova (highest rank) is pretty effective to kill them one shot.\n\nWe were two priests in group; the other priest gave me all his Oil of immolation, major mana potion and dark runes.

Look for the purple and green auras and tend to them first.&nbsp; I also put a renew on them if they were low, since arrows could take them out. \n\n- [b]Renew:[\/b] The second most important spell to cast is Renew. You will be casting Cure and Renew almost constantly.\n\n- [b]Be ready to bubble and renew yourself.[\/b]&nbsp; When you see skellies come, bubble -- once they get to you, use an immolation potion.&nbsp; The potions are on very short timer, so you can use them within seconds of each other if you need to. Do not be frugal with Immolation potions.&nbsp; Just use them, period.\n\n- [b]Interface changes:[\/b] On my hotbars, I put renew on key 1, cure disease (the higher level one) on key 2. For me, turning on healthbars was was obtrusive.&nbsp; Instead, I remapped my \"Tab\" key to select nearest allies intead of nearest enemies.

It�s not easy, but not nearly as overwhelming as it first appears\n\nFirst off, know that Oil of Immolation is complete trash. Don�t even contemplate using it. You will be AOEing skeletons down like a mage with only one Rank 3 Holy Nova. I repeat, this spell will one shot every skeleton within range. Let 5 or more collect on you and then AOE. If you nova but missed one, just shield and let them collect on you for the next 30 seconds or so. As soon as they eat through your shield, drop all of them. You�ll be surprised how much time you�ll spend not being attacked and able to concentrate on your heals if you do your best to maximize the amount of skeletons killed per Nova. With Oil of Immolation you have to worry about your health, skeleton adds constantly swarming you, and getting your heals interrupted. With the AOE you will cast it once and clear the screen. I would guess I killed about 2-3 of these skeleton packs per wave, instead of getting swarmed and waiting for them to take damage from oil. If you�ve seen the video you know what I�m talking about. Personally I made managing skeletons my priority so once I wiped a cluster I could concentrate on heals. \n\nSecond, Decursing is your priority- purple then green. Throw a Renew on anyone that has been cursed. There, I�ve just explained 80% of this test. Personally I used rank 6 renew. I can�t testify if that�s the most ideal rank, but it worked. All over this page people will advocate different ranks. Rank 6 is certainly high enough, but if you�re having mana issues try down-ranking. The cursed peasants will, for the most part, be the only peasants needing your attention. If none are cursed you should just wait for someone to drop below 50%. For the most part you wont need to throw heals on non-cursed peasants. \n\nRenew is your best friend. I cast flash heal (rank 5) less than 5 times the entire encounter. Once you clear skeleton packs you will be surprised how little damage the peasants take from the arrows and you can fully concentrate on decursing and renewing those peasants. Renew is plenty of healing. It�s fairly easy to click through them, inspecting their health, giving priority to the ones who get diseased.&nbsp; \n\nWith that said, I would highly recommend downloading a mod called Tiny Tips. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.curse-gaming.com\/en\/wow\/addons-4397-1-tinytip.html\n\nIt basically allows your tooltips to appear on whatever you mouse over. So you can see a peasant�s health by just mousing over them instead of clicking. This way you can quickly scan the group and see who�s taking the most damage (hint: usually the guys glowing or getting shot). With their health bars hidden you actually can see the animation which will be a good indication who should be getting heals. Regardless, you�ll be surprised how little healing they�ll actually need once the skeletons are off your rear.\n\nAs far as buffs go, I wouldn�t really stress out over them. The most important consumables are major mana pots. Use the first one early so you�ll have time to use another one at the end if you need. Personally, I was only self buffed, had MoTW, with Nightfin Soup and a Mageblood potion. No AI from a mage, or Paladin Blessings or Auras (although, if you could get a pally to give you a 15 minute blessing of wisdom, that would probably be a huge help if you�re struggling with mana). Mana regeneration is infinitely more useful than +healing (not helpful for renews and flash heals) so get your highest INT and +mana\/5 gear. Honestly if you think you need more buffs\/consumables you probably just need more practice, save your gold.\n\nI was fairly well geared for this encounter, but not compared to a lot of people. I went in with 3k health, 5.5 mana, +41\/5. Not amazing, but substantial\n\nIf you download Tiny Tip, Decurse \/Renew in a timely fashion and Nova to maximize skeleton kills you�ll have a much easier stroll to Benediction. The respawn on the quest giver is apparently only 15 minutes now, so do a number of dry runs to calm your nerves and know what to expect.

Sometimes, you just get screwed and many archers will all start targeting the same guy and take them down faster than rank 6 renew can handle... Other times, the archers will be stupid and barely hurting anyone at all. \n\nI also failed a few times because I was getting too far away from the cave... If you stray too far, the skeletons will spawn and agro on the peasants instead of you, and if they coordinate their efforts, they can take them down pretty fast. You want those skeletons on YOU, and then you want them DEAD (preferably with rank 3 holy nova, if you dont have it, sorry, don;t know what to tell ya)\n\nOnce the peasants are like 75 \"feet\" from the \"in zone\", if they have over 50% life they generally will make it, even if they are being shot at and dont have a renew on. \n\nThe key for me was to (in order of priority):\n\nA: Stay close enough to the cave so that you can run up to the spawn point and eliminate skeletons with extreme predjudice using rank 3 holy nova(always be ready to get them off peasants immediatley!) As some people have mentioned, its sometimes a good idea to try to gather up alot of skeletons before you nova for mana conservation, but in all honestly, I was a little wasteful and spammed nova sometimes. I still made it.\n\nB: Immediatley dispell all diseases, \n\nC: THEN if no one is diseased, steadily click thru peasants, using rank 6 renew or RARELY a flash heal (i probably flash healed 3 or 4 times on my succesful attempt, and i used the high rank spell because i hate screwing with alot of low rank stuff) (not a single fire potion or yeti or whatever was used, but stratholme holy water is quite effective if you have it). \n\nD: Once they get 75 - 50 feet from the safe zone, I ignore them, and yes a few died; but almost NONE died up near the cave where i was doing all my work.\n\nE: As soon as you have used about 2000 mana, drink a major mana potion, and every 2 minutes after that, at least drink a \"combat mana potion\" (pvp potion from officers barracks)\n\nIt doesnt really matter which buffs, potions or foods you use, but you probably want to stack up on a few int and regen buffs.\n\nI ended up using:\n1 major mana potion\n2 combat mana potions\n1 elixir of greater intellect\n1 runn tum tuber +10 int food thingie\n1 lesser mana oil +8 mana regen on weapon\n\nDemonic runes and stratholme holy water were quite effective on my failed attempts but I ran out and ended up completing it with the above list.\n\nIf you don't have holy nova, I would suggest Stratholme holy water, fireshield potions, mechanical yeti, dynamite, peasant caller... ect.

Obtain the Eye of Divinity. The Eye of Divinity is a drop from Majordomo's (Level 500 elite mob) chest. Majordomo can be found in the Molten Core instance, which is in Blackrock Depths. Level 55+. You have to complete the following steps in order to get Majordomo Executus to spawn (Thanks Mythisafk!).\n\nGet 7 to 8 people to complete the following Quests from Duke Hydraxis in Azshara \n\nPoisoned Water \nStormers and Rumblers \nEye of the Emberseer \nThe Molten Core\nAgent of Hyraxis \nHands of the Enemy \n\nHands of the Enemy requires you to collect the hands of Lucifron, Gehennas, Shazzrah and Sulfuron. \n\nAfter completing the quest you get a Vial which can be used douse one of the seven or eight flame traps in Molten Core. Technically, you only need one person to complete the quest, but it's easier with seven or eight people with one vial each. \n\nEach flame trap is guarded by: \nLucifron\nMagmadar \nGehennas \nGarr \nBaron Geddon \nShazzrah \nSulfuron \nGolemagg \n\nAfter spawning Majordomo you have to force him to submit by killing his eight guards at the same time while tanking Majordomo himself. After he submits a chest will appear. You only have five minutes to open the chest and loot items before it despawns. \n\nBasically it takes a 40 man crew two days normally to clear Majordomo. The Eye drops roughly 40% of the time. Only one eye will drop, so you'll have to kill Majordomo once per Priest. The eye is bind on pickup however. Equip the eye and use it to obtain a clue. Follow the clue to the next step.\n\n\n2. Obtain the Splinter of Nordrassil. \nA guide to completing the Epic Priest quest event \nBy: Paladeus (Immortality – Skullcrusher)\n\n\nUpon obtaining the eye of divinity from Major Domo’s chest, the priest must equip it in order to gain a clue as to where the quest will take him.  The eye tells the tale of a sole priest who failed in saving fleeing peasants from the onslaught of an UD invasion.\n…you must make up for what she could not do!\n\n\nFirst, head to the Stratholme area and find the NPC.  She is located due west of Stratholme after passing thru a cave, on the left side. If you reach the Terrorweb tunnel, you’ve gone too far! She can ONLY be seen when the eye of divinity is equipped.  She will tell you her tale, after which the quest will appear that if you accept, will begin the event that you must succeed in!\n\n\nThe Event:\nNote: you must keep the eye of divinity EQUIPPED for the entire duration of the event\n\nYou have to save the lives of 50 peasants before 15 die.  The peasants will spawn in groups of 10 near the cave to the East.  In order to “save” them, the peasants must reach the area near the NPC.  While the peasants are traveling from the cave to this point, they will be fired upon by UD archers which CANNOT be killed, melee’d by UD warriors (which in turn melee you), and sporadically given a disease (which appears as a green cloud) that must be cured ASAP as it eats away their life very quickly.\n\nHow to beat it:\n\n (The items, buffs, and people you might want \/need when you attempt it)\n\n\nA group of 5 people, consisting of you, 2 paladins, a warlock and a mage…the people you bring with you MUST STAND ON TOP OF THE NPC and never move, as it will cause you to fail the quest.  However, from this place, the auras and such will still reach you and be of GREAT use.  Granted, not all of the below things are “needed”, but with the 2 hour wait between attempts, it might be nice to have a good shot at it in one try.  \n\nAuras:\nConcentration Aura OR Devotion Aura\nRetribution Aura\nBlood Pact (warlock Imp)\n\n\nBuffs (both spell and item buffs)\nImproved Fortitude\nInner Fire\nArcane Intellect\nMark of the Wild\nBlessing of Kings\nBlessing of Wisdom\nThorns Aura (or the crystal form of it from Ungoro crystal towers)\nDivine Spirit (or the crystal form of it from Ungoro crystal towers)\nCerebral Cortex Compound (+50 intellect, quest in Blasted Lands that’s repeatable)\nRum Tum Tuber Surprise (10 int)\nNightfin Soup (mana \/ 5 sec regen)\nWildblossom berries (10 stam)\n\n\nItems\n\nOIL OF IMMOLATION (this is by far a must have to complete this quest easily!)\nMana \/ Health Potions\nDemonic Runes (sacrifices life and give you mana – from demons in felwood)\nWhipper Root Tubers (restore health - from felwood)\nNightdragon Plants(restore small health and mana - from felwood)\n\n\nThere are some very key things that should be noted about the event that will help you tremendously when attempting it.\n\n\nManually targeting the peasants to heal them can be a pain!  In order to alleviate this, make sure to have their health bars displayed above their heads (by pressing hotkey “V”) and also targeting them by clicking their health bars, not their bodies!\nWhen the waves of peasants spawn, there will be a few in the front of the pack that almost have a “purple” glow to them.  These peasants are extremely weak and must be cured and healed immediately or they will die.  This can easily cause the priest to fail the quest when they first attempt it, as I did.\nRight before the first wave of peasants reaches the safe point (and every group thereafter), the next group will spawn.  Therefore, it is imperative that you turn around and head back towards the cave and be ready to heal those weak peasants in the front first.  In addition, the second wave of peasants will cause the UD melee warriors to spawn.  I found it best to FEAR (yes they CAN be feared) this initial group of warriors as it allowed me to compose myself, heal the very weak peasants, and in turn gain their agro so they weren’t targeting peasants.  I did this every time a new wave spawned.\nWhen Melee UD warriors engage you (and they will, after you pop one heal on a peasant) Activate your Oil of Immolation!  These potions have no cool down between uses and grant you the chance to deal tons of damage to melee things attacking you.  Combined with the auras listed above, the UD fighters (which don’t have much health) will die after 1-2 swings at you, saving your mana from having you use it on healing yourself.\nIt’s a good idea to hotkey Flash heal (rank 6 or 7, depending on how much  bonus +healing you have, ONE of these will fully heal the peasant), Renew rank 9, and abolish disease to keys right next to each other…such as 1, 2 and 3.  These will be the only spells you will use on the peasants and you need to use them in rapid succession.  AOE heal does not work, nor do you have the time to cast a spell that long.\nUsing Renew on peasants around ½ health as they near the NPC is a good strategy as it allows you to not worry about their health and in turn focus on the next group that’s about to spawn.\nUse Health \/ Mana Potions frequently, renew, and divine prayer (if you have it) to heal yourself if needed.  Do not waste time healing yourself with cast time spells as it will make keeping the peasants alive that much more difficult.\nYour friends that are there for support \/ giving you the buffs CANNOT see the NPC’s.  So, as hard as it might be for them, you must convince them NOT to move as to them, you’ll be running around alone taking damage and healing nothing!\nAll told, you should count on their being at least 6 waves of peasants, as some will die here and there…it is unavoidable.  Upon completing the event, you gain the Splinter of Nordrassil, that when used will form the Benediction Staff as long as you also posses the Eye of Shadow! (which can be obtained by killing Kazzak, an outdoor raid boss in the blasted lands, or by farming high level demons for it)  \n\n\nBest of Luck to all of you who attempt it!\n\n\n\n\n3. Obtain the Eye of Shadow. The Eye of Shadow drops off of Lord Kazzak, a very powerful elite boss in the Blasted Lands. Bring a raid group. Currently, you MUST be in the kill group in order to loot the Eye. Tigole says they plan to change this so you can loot the Eye even if you're not in the raid group. Update from Tregga: Well it seems Tigole was mistaken about the impending change. He just came back and said you will have to be in the group that tags Kazzak in order to have a chance to loot it. However, it was not intended to have the Priest epic quest loot only drop from raid encounters. The devs are looking into alternate methods for Priests to get the drops required for the epic quest.\n\nTips for fighting Lord Kazzak (Taken from Elenandaron's post on the Thottbot.com's boards) :\n\nFirst of all, his attacks: \n\n\nMelee \nHis melee attacks are pretty weak, no more than 1500 hits on cloth users. \n\n'Shadowbolt Volley' \nShoots out an insanely long range volley of Shadowbolts that damage anything it can target in distance for 800-1000 damage. The volley totally ignores all line of sight issues: it cannot be dodged. \n\nTwisted Reflection \nCasts a magical debuff (on a random player in range other than the player with aggro) that heals Lord Kazzak for 25,000 health each time he deals damage to the player with this debuff. This combined with the Shadowbolt Volley can ruin the attempt. \n\nMark of Kazzak \nCasts a curse (on a random player in range with mana) that drains the target's mana for 250 per second and explodes for 4,000 AOE damage when there is no more mana to drain. A living bomb. \n\nCleave \nAttacks a number of melee range players around him with a cleaving strike that deals 1000-2000 damage to each. Since a 'blind spot' has not been found, Cleave might be capped to a certain number of players affected. \n\nThunderclap \nA point blank area of effect spell, hardly dealing any damage, but slowing movement speed. Some have reported 200 damage, some say it doesn't deal damage at all. Doesn't seem to affect attacking speed either. \n\nVoid Bolt \nA strong bolt he may cast only on the player with aggro, deals up to 3000 shadow damage (or more!). \n\nCapture Soul \nWhen a player, pet or totem gets killed, Lord Kazzak casts this spell to instantly regenerate 70,000 health. \n\nAlright, now you know pretty well what you're fighting against. Here's how the battle itself works: \n\nOnce he is aggroed and the fight begins, you have no more than three (3) minutes to kill him. I'll explain later why. He starts off with everything he's got. He keeps meleeing the main tank while Cleaving once in a while for rogues swarming around him and keeps sending Shadowbolt Volleys to hurt everyone around. The volleys are not on a timer, instead he casts them as he sees fit. In some rare cases there's about 30 seconds between the casts, sometimes he does it every five seconds. In the meantime, he casts Twisted Reflection and the rarer Mark of Kazzak on random people. \n\nWhat to do here: \nSend your main tank in and let him build some aggro for a short while, just enough so he won't come at you the first time you cast something on him. Then unload. Have your DPS classes give him everything they have. Priests have to be extra mindful about the magical debuff he casts on your group. It has to be removed as soon as possible or the attempt will soon end in a disaster. Priests are also in charge of healing their groups thanks to that Shadowbolt Volley that keeps hitting everyone all the time. Mages need to be on top of the curse situtation. Mark of Kazzak can and will cause a wipe if you let it go off on you. Dispel the curse as soon as you can. All casters should also leave about 1000 mana in their mana pool just in case he casts the curse on you. That'll give the mages four seconds to dispel before it goes off. In other words, 1000 mana is out of mana in this raid encounter. Also, anyone dying during the fight is not an option. Unless it happens during the first five seconds of the fight, you've failed already. Do not use grounding totems, pets or other small things he can kill for the 70,000 health heal. \n\nYour group will have exactly three minutes to finish the demon off. If you fail to kill him in that time due to lack of DPS, people dying or not dispelling Twisted Reflection properly, Lord Kazzak will enter what is called the supreme mode. Named after his yell once it triggers, the supreme mode causes him to cast his Shadowbolt every second. That's 800-1000 DPS on everyone, kids, and that means a wipe.\n\n\n\n4. Combine the 3 items. Once you have all 3 items, combine them to form your new epic staff, Anathema\/Benediction. Using one form of the staff will change it to the other and visa versa. Congratulations! You're completed your Priest epic quest! \n\nUpdate from Tregga: Right now either side can be enchanted but you lose any enchantments for good if you switch versions. The problem apparently is that when you switch the forms of the staff from one to the other, you're essentially destroying one staff and having a new copy of the other version of your staff added to your inventory.  7\/20\/05- This bug is still an issue after the 1.6.0 patch was released. There are no updates or estimates on a fix at this time.","date":"2005-09-13T15:23:39-05:00","rating":9,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Hi Pipsss!\n\nThanks alot for letting us know, how to make that quest..!

He doesn’t know what he’s talking about lol.\r\n\r\nFirst off, Eris Havenfire’s rez timer is not 2 hours and hasn’t been for over a decade. It’s only 15 minutes. He only despawns if you lose or die, if you succeed he will stay there.\r\nBecause of this you don’t need to bring a friend with you to summon the cleaner. Whether you lose or die to the cleaner, Eris’ rez timer will be the same. \r\n\r\nI did this with about 5000 mana. I had some consumes, but as long as your mana is 5000+ you should be fine. Wear gear with intellect and mp5. Mana management is the most important thing in completing the challenge. Bring 3 major mana potions (or a bunch more if it’s your first try). Pop one at half mana and then the others when you need them. Use inner focus when it’s up. Cast flash heal rank 4 on the peasants and abolish disease on the ones with purple and green clouds. Prioritize purple, green is not as big of a deal. Once the peasants are at the end get back to the cave opening fast to meet the next wave. Wait for the skeletons to group up you and then cast holy nova rank 4 on them or use strat holy water if you are low on mana. I didn’t have thorns but I can see how it would be helpful here. I also didn’t have Second Wind but that trinket is super useful here. If you use Second Wind you probably only need 2 mana pots.\r\n\r\nJust heal up peasants as they lose health, don’t worry too much if a few die, always make sure to get back to meet the next wave when they spawn.

As a first time WoW player with classic i found the quest to be quite challenging! and i think i may know why. \r\nThe quest requires you to Cure Diseases and Heal waves of peasants as they try to survive a short gauntlet of arrow fire and low health skeletons to safety. \r\n\r\nAs a Priest who began his healing career making use of an addon called \"Healbot\" i had almost ZERO experience when it came to TARGETING then casting the appropriate spell. Healbot is all mouse-over clicking! I took about 3 runs to \"unlearn\" my habitual healing mouse-over habits. Just a friendly heads up for other Healbot users out there =]\r\n\r\nA few tips for people struggling which made my 4th (and successful) attempt very easy. \r\n\r\n1. BRING YOUR MAGE BUDDY! I cannot stress enough how much of a difference having extra Mana on this quest helps. The entire quest is basically a clinic on manapool management, having straight up more Mana is a HUGE help for this. Secondly, if you are REALLY struggling with this quest, your mage friend can also help clear out the skeletons by standing on the hill next to Eris Havenfire and casting Blizzard or Arcane Explosion at the choke point. We have tried this 3 different times, all 3 times the Cleaner was NOT spawned and the mage was able to instantly clear the melee skeleton mobs. As long as the mage stays clear of the \"path\" the peasants are on the Cleaner will not trigger.\r\n\r\n2. Immolation Potions> Holy Nova rank 4. \r\nWhile Holy Nova will instantly clear the wave of skeletons, it is a very Mana intensive spell. I found myself panicking & casting Holy Nova instead of popping another Immolation and wanding once or twice. Holy Nova ONLY if you are about to die.\r\n\r\n2. Heal Rank 2> Flash Heal rank 4. \r\nMy first 3 attempts i was using Flash Heal rank 4. I found myself popping Major Mana potions much too quickly, while also using up 2 dark runes just to stay ahead mana wise. Once i switched to using Heal rank 2 it made all the difference in the world. Heal rank 2 when peasants are getting low or even using Renew Rank 6-9 on targets taking damage but are above 50% HP was enough to get them across the finish line. Don't waste your attempts like I did using Flash Heal. Just take it off your bar for this one. \r\n\r\n3. Druid friend with Thorns spell.\r\nHaving a druid buddy come along can be a HUGE help with the skeleton mobs. Park your druid buddy at the mouth of the cave in Bear form with Thorns active. They will pull aggro from the melee skeletons and quickly kill them with Thorns. It was such a HUGE help, this cannot be understated. My first two attempts where fails simply because i died to melee skeletons.\r\n\r\n4. Addon's\/Nameplates.\r\nOn my first attempt I had a very hard time with the visual clarity of who i needed to target\/cure. I ended up using an addon called \"KuiNameplates\" which i found to be extremely helpful when it comes to targeting the correct peasant. This addon will give you a much cleaner healthbar as well as debuff icons next to the name, so you can instantly tell which targets to Cure. It can also be helpful to turn off \"stacking nameplates\"\r\n\r\nRandom side notes.\r\n 1) Eris Havenfire respawns in about 15 mins ALWAYS. I failed, i died, i triggered cleaner and every time she respawned in about 15 mins. Never waited 2hrs like some have suggested.\r\n\r\n2) I spent WAY too much gold on consumables. It will be different for everyone, but on my successful run i used: 2 Major Mana Potions, 5 Immolation Potions, 1 Nightfin Soup with about 5200 Manapool after Buffs. Bought 5 Dark Runes which are still chillin in my bags sad face.\r\n\r\nI decided to write this up in hopes of helping out any other new Priests (like me) out there who have failed this a couple of times and might be feeling a little discouraged. I know this quest definitely challenged me in a way Classic Wow hadn't before and I'm sure I'm not the only one.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1562</b></h3>The guide at wowhealers is just overkill. All you need is some major mana/heal pots and about 30 oil of immolation. Pop the oil 2-3 seconds after the skeletons spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Synegh</b></h3>To get Benediction/Anathema, priests must do this:<br /><br />1. Eye of Divinity - You get this by defeating Majordomo Executus in Molten Core, the final boss before Ragnaros. When you defeat him he submits and you are able to loot his chest. There is a 50% chance that it will contain the Eye of Divinity, otherwise it will hold the Ancient Petrified Leaf which is part of the hunter epic quest. Majordomo is a difficult fight and you will need to be in an experienced raiding guild in order to defeat him.<br /><br />2. Eye of Shadow - You can get this by farming high level elite demons in Winterspring or Blasted Lands. You will need a group of people to farm these demons, and the Eye has a low drop rate (however it has increased significantly since the last patch). Alternatively, you can kill Lord Kazzak in the Blasted Lands, a 40-man outdoor raid boss; he drops the Eye of Shadow 100% of the time.<br /><br />3. Epic Quest Encounter - Finally, after you have both Eyes, you are ready to do the quest that will complete the staff. This quest is done in the Eastern Plaguelands. You must have the Eye of Divinity equipped in order to see the quest giver. The quest involves protecting several waves of peasants from attacks as they travel from a cave to the quest giver. The quest, while hard, is not overly difficult as long as you bring the right tools to the fight. You can find guides on how to complete this quest from a number of sources.<br /><br />As you can see, getting Benediction/Anathema is no small task. The biggest roadblock most will encounter is finding a guild that can defeat Majordomo; I've just recently joined a guild that has him on farm status, so it's just a matter of time as I wait for my turn to loot the Eye. Other than that you could technically complete the rest solo and with pick-ups. However, if this is not an option for you, don't fret. There are a number of blue staves available that can fill the rolls of Benediction/Anathema while you wait for your opportunity to get this great item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2590</b></h3>I'm not sure if any of these still work but its worth a try:<br /><br />Paladin: You will get the benefit of his aura if you're grouped with him. Also, if the paladin spams heals on himself the skeletons will all run and attack him then he can consecrate and tank them.<br /><br />Mage: You can tell the mage where to blizzard, etc, and the skeletons will still get hit even though the mage cannot see them. This works well in conjunction with the paladin tanking all the skeletons = )<br /><br />Priest: Though I didn't do this, I was told other priests can use their Eye trinkets or even the Scholomance ghost trinket to see the NPCs and help heal them. I seem to recall hearing that was definitley nerfed though.<br /><br />Anyway, I completed my quest first try with a paladin and a mage there to help me, and didnt use any oils of immolations or anything. If even the mage aoe still works, I'd highly recommend it = )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6981</b></h3>A few steps in how to get Benediction:<br /><br />1. Get a guild that's raiding MC(Molten Core)<br />2. Kill Majordomo, he spawns a chest, Eye of Divinity (needed for making Benediction) has a chance to drop from that chest, after you got this eye, you get a lvl 60 group and go to Southern Winterspring, and start killing the demons! When you got Eye of Shadow, you equip Eye of Divinity, and go to EPL, Near strat u'll find a questgiver, u need to have EoD equiped to see her. She will give you a very hard quest.. Basically you have to save 50 peasants from undead (archers and melee). If 15 or more die you fail and there is a 2h cooldown before you can try again. - Use rank 8 renew and you'll save some mana<br />- get a ton of oil of immolations and use them whenever the skeleton melee's come out, they only hvae about 100hp and the oil will kill them in 2 hits<br />-15 of the peasents can die - only 3 died on me<br />-get a couple mana pots, i used 3<br />-also, keep an eye on your own health, mine got down to 43 twice then i shielded<br />-when you start off, the peasents spawn in groups of 10, and there are a few in front with a purple haze to them, they are diseased, so cast your cure disease spell on them asap<br />-other than that, just be sure to stay alive and cast renew on any peasent taht's loosing health. I hope this will help you :)</div>

But in patch 2.0.1 it is 28 crit rateing for spells. Which does not specify that it is only Holy spells anymore.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7700</b></h3>Best healing weapon for a priest pre-BWL. Weapon also turns into Anathema which is a great shadow priest pvp weapon. This is a priest weapon through a quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Domebuddy</b></h3>You can do it the legit way, Or you can do it the easy way. For people that simply dont have the cash to buy multiple potions of immolation heres a tip. You can simply get a warlock or mage to help you get off those baddies. To avoid getting that dreadlord attacking you, you must have your friends stand directly ontop of the quest givers. Then you must make sure they never heal you. If they heal you, the Cleaner shows up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8060</b></h3>First of all to begin the quest for the priest staff you will need two things:<br /><br />Eye of Shadow - can be obtained from either Lord Kazzak, or farmed off of elite demons in the very southern section of Winterspring (you can do an 'eye of shadow' search on wowhead for exactly which demons).<br />Eye of Divinity - From the chest of Major Domo in Molten Core. The drop rate is not very rare. About 50/50. It's either the eye or the hunter leaf.<br /><br />After those two have been obtained here are some tips for completing the quest:<br /><br />First supply yourself with plenty of oils of immolation, mana pots, mana regen food etc. If you can bring a few friends to come along for auras/buffs.<br /><br />IF you happen to know another priest who is on the quest you can do it together (just be sure you dont heal each other or the qeust WILL fail). Equip the eye of divinity to see the NPC (she is located just west of the live entrance to strat). If you do not have the item equipped you will not be able to see her.<br /><br />The quest involves saving 50 peasants before 15 die. Downranking will be a huge mana saver here because the peasants dont have very much life. Also keep your abolish disease handy because they will be inflicted with this as well.<br /><br />The hardest part is being able to keep an eye on the peasants health because of some bug/or on purpose you can no longer see their health bars above their heads. But if you are quick with the renewss/abolish disease you should be golden.<br /><br />I have heard as long as the AOE'er does not move, a mage or warlock can stand at the mouth of the cave and kill the mobs that come through there as long as they DO NOT move. If this is not an option that is what the oils of immolation are for.<br /><br />An old, but very handy walkthrough is also availible here: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowhealers.com/content/view/124/50/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowhealers.com/content/view/124/50/</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RakothMaugrim</b></h3>If you press ctrl-V you will see there health bars, and for those who had trouble like me, the skellies are fearable, holynovable (very useful here) and a mana pot should be used as early as possible. <br /><br />I burned 3 major Mana, 7 oils of immolation that fight. Stay around the healer, she can heal you as well, but its not much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7833</b></h3>Some important things to remember: <br /><br />1. Get really good at monitoring your cooldown timers and use them as effectively as you can. <br />2. Don't use flash heal *most inefficient heal mana-wise* unless absolutely necessary. <br />3. Dispell and choose your rank of renew on citizen's damage taken. <br />4. Choose your gear with the most +heal and mana regen. <br />5. You need to act like the tank and the healer at the same time; because you want aggro on you from the mobs on the ground, you can't do anything about the ranged attacks. <br /><br />Stratholme holy water &quot;not sure on cooldown, but they wreak havoc&quot; <br />Immolation Pots &quot;not a typical cooldown timer&quot; <br />Crystal Charge from Ungoro <br />Major Mana Pots <br />Mageblood potion <br />Scrolls, Scrolls, Scrolls if a particular class is missing for help <br />Night Dragon's Breath - Felwood <br />Whipper Root <br /><br />Be sure to utilize Inner fire <br />You could have 2 paladins with you for their buffs and Auras. <br />Druid for Motw and thorns <br />....and apparently you can use a party member's AOE if they don't move, a mage would work then you can mooch their AI buff as well. <br /><br />The most important thing to remember is that you have to save X citizens before X citizens die. You can't save them all so if 1 or 2 die, don't worry too much.....don't get all stressed about it. <br /><br />The point I got out of this quest is that you need to use your timers and available backup tools as best as you can. You also need to think about how efficient your mana use is. It's just like any raid really. Unfortunately, these citizens can't bandage up.<br /><br />I will say this however...it is better to be overprepared than under. This quest was nerfed and is now very soloable...but having friends there does makes things much much easier.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Binary</b></h3>This is one of the best staffs a healing priest can obtain, and more than that, it's relatively easy to complete the quest.<br />However, Grand Marshal's Warhammer (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23454#z0z">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23454#z0z</a>) is not only even easier to get since patch 2.0, but also is only a main-hand - letting you equip even more +healing onto your off-hand. Not to mention the fact that the mace has over +20 healing points over Benediction ;).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8558</b></h3>Another example for healing guide:<br /><br />1. Gear<br /><br />Your effectiveness as a healer is highly dependent upon your gear. You want lots of intellect, spirit and +healing spell gear to maximize your healing potential when grouped. So if your particular talent build calls for different stats, consider carrying additional gear to equip whenever you're asked to be the primary healer. This is especially important for feral-specced druids, who prefer strength and stamina to intellect and spirit.<br /><br />2. Know who's expendable<br /><br />All classes bring something unique to a group. And your ultimate goal is to keep everyone alive. But unfortunately, the roles that people play in your group are not all equal when it comes to expendability. Your priorities, listed from most important to least important, include the following roles, generally played by the following classes:<br /><br />Yourself<br />Main Tank (Should NEVER NEVER EVER be below 60% hp)<br />Off Tank's<br />MELEE DPS<br />Ranged DPS<br /><br />So really when were throwing heals on mages/locks and not on rogue's were screwing up. Mages/Locks/Hunters should never get hit nor healed as much as rogues. Not only can they bandage but they dont have to even back up because tey should be 30 yards away from the target. Note the llist does change with each different encounter like AOE encounters.<br /><br />3. Use efficient healing spells<br />Your mana is your lifeline as a healer (and the lifeline of everyone else). So manage it carefully. Different spells will heal more efficiently when used on different classes and armor-types. This is governed by casting speed, type of heal and potency.<br /><br />Renew - Great HoT and unlike most heals doesnt gain aggro right away should ALWAYS be 1 on the tank.<br /><br />Flash Heal - If you cast 100 heals, 99 of them will be flash heals. This talent is the most effective when your tanks getting beat on for 1-2k per hit. Remember the tank usually only has about 6k life so ruffly 15% of his life gets taken away per hit, flash heal is usually faster then any attack of a boss and can counter act the dmg done and if crits can replenish the tanks health to full without a problem.<br /><br />Greater Heal - I can't stress enough DON'T use this unless you have innerfocus. This talent alltho does do alot of healing costs alot of mana and takes 3 seconds to cast. So unless your tanks at full and you can predict that hes ganna take X amount of dmg and needs a greater heal dont cast it. Stick with FLASH heal.<br /><br />Power Word: Shield - The single best talent a priest has. It's an instant cast spell that gives a buble that absorbs 1k dmg. This should always be on teh tank if he doesnt have 1 on already. The only time you wouldnt put it on right away is if its a mortal strike boss. At that point you need to wait for the mortal strike to hit and then bubble. For those of you that don't know what mortal strike is, It reduces healing by 50% and does a tremendous amount of damage. Note even after you bubble you should still be aware of the tanks health and if below 60% still spam heals on him.<br /><br />4. The smart way to panic<br />As good as you get at controlling your aggro, eventually you will have to deal with a mob or two that you just can't shake. Let's start with what NOT to do:<br /><br />1) Don't run away. When you run, the main tank (or off tank) has a much harder time pulling the offending mob(s) from you. Plus, you can't heal your party if you're on the move. Worse yet, you may inadvertently pull more mobs.<br /><br />2) Avoid healing yourself. This can begin a cycle of futility. The more you heal yourself, the more aggro you generate and the more health you'll lose to the attacker(s). Furthermore, the mob(s) attacking you will be increasingly harder for others to pull.<br /><br />So what should you do? <br /><br />1) Use 'Fade' to reduce the aggro you've accumulated (as well as aggro you will accumlate) for 10 seconds. It can instantly free you of a mob or two and allow your tank the opportunity to pull mobs back to himself. And that means you can get back to healing. Rem</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8558</b></h3>HEALING GUIDE-2<br /><br />2) Move toward the tank. Make your way toward the main tank (or off tank). The closer you are to him, the faster he will be able to pull the offending mob(s) from you.<br /><br />3) If Fade doesn't work and your tank's a bit late picking it up always Power Word: Shield And Renew. Both these are instant and you can run to the tank.<br /><br />4. Support your party<br />As the primary healer, you are the main part of your group. But don't just pay attention to healing. There are a few other things you can do to further support your party.<br /><br />1) Use mana potions. As stated above, your mana is the lifeline of everyone in your party. When you run out, you cannot heal. So always keep a stack of mana potions handy that are on par with your current level. In our case its combat pots or better.<br /><br />2) Let us know when your RUNNING out of mana. To many times in raids ppl have died because they say im oom instead of saying Im low on mana can I get some help healing.<br /><br />3) Decurse your party. If theres ANY Magic debuff on the raid, ie Soul Burn THATS OUR #1 PRIORITY. Were the only class capable of removing the magic debuffs horde side so thats our job. If your wondering yes it DOES take priority over healing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9590</b></h3>To get this staff you need to first defeat Majordomo Executus in the Molten Core and open his chest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First off you'll need to collect two(2) things; the Eye of Shadow; and the <br />Eye of Divinity. The easiest and usually the first gotten is the Eye of <br />Shadow, which is obtained from either killing Kazzak, or randomly dropped <br />off an elite demon found in various parts of the world, one being <br />Winterspring's Darkwhisper Gorge. Now for the Eye of Divinity, you'll have <br />to have an extreme raid take out Majordomo Executus in the Molten Core. <br />After you have collected the Eye of Divinity, you'll have to keep it <br />equipped and travel to the Eastern Plaguelands and find a ghostly priest <br />near the cave in between Stratholme and Terrordale. In order to start the <br />quest she gives named &quot;The Balance of Light and Shadow,&quot; you'll need to have <br />the Eye of Divinity equipped at all times, but not the Eye of Shadow. <br /><br />quoted from <a href="http://www.koaworld.com/articles/link.php?id=19" rel="nofollow">http://www.koaworld.com/articles/link.php?id=19</a><br /><br />you can read the rest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>with the patch (the AQ one 1.9 i think), u can no longer do the quest as 2-3 priests lol. i just tried doing that with a friend and he did the quest i didnt. after he was done i tried and failed lol. now 2 hrs have passed and hes doing the quest for me :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest can be incredibly hard for most folks, but really easy if you are use to spamming and are a wonderful multi-tasker! I did this with just reading and talking with folks, without seeing a video of what is to come. If you can, find a video beforehand so you know what to expect!<br /><br />If you find yourself having a low mana pool, try to acquire some of these items before heading it:<br /><br />Nightfin Soup (Mana regeneration for 10 minutes)<br />Mageblood Potion (More mana regeneration)<br />Demonic /Dark Runes (You can heal yourself the life back. Demonic are BoP and harder to get - Dark may be a bit expensive on different servers because of being a reagent in many things.)<br /><br />If you want an easy way to wipe out the skeletons that do attack you, carry Oil of Immolations. A lot of priests have claimed to use 15-25 on their run, but I surprisingly used less than 10, with the thorns buff.<br /><br />These buffs are very helpful as well:<br />Mark of the Wild (Obviously Druid)<br />Blessing of Wisdom (Paladin)<br />Divine Spirit (Priest - More spirit for regen)<br />Thorns (Druid - Saves you on having to spam Oils :D)<br />Blessing of Kings (Paladin - but harder to find now because of their respec. I went without it)<br />Blessing of Sanctuary (Paladin - also another nice buff but harder to find because of paladins. I went without it as well)<br /><br />You can NOT have anyone in your party because of the risks that can happen. If you walk out of a paladin aura and walk back into it, you have outside help and will fail the quest. So partying up with a few paladins and a warlock is too much of a risk and will probably be nerfed anyways. The quest is to do it on your own anyways, so just stock up on buffs before the fight.<br /><br />A lot of folks find it easier to use the 'v' option in game - where you can see the peasants healthbars over their head. While it's hard when the skeletons are attacking, it's very useful to see who is going to drop down.<br /><br />Use low level renews and you barely will have to flash heal - but it's also a good idea to hotkey abolish disease. I had level 2, 3, 6 and 9 of renew - 9 for myself, 6 for when it was an emergency and 2-3 to normally heal the peasants.<br /><br />There are about 6 waves of 10 peasants each - an estimated number. A lot of the people I have talked to say the first wave is crucial, but there are some waves I expierenced where I barely had to heal. Certain points in the quest come where Eris Havenfire (quest NPC) will heal you. I am not too sure if she gives you mana as well since I wasn't paying too much attention to her.<br /><br />When the skeletons come up to attack you, put up a power word: shield and cast a couple of Oil of Immolations. They have barely any HP, but you shouldn't focus on wanding them to death or whatever to save money - your focus should be on the peasants entirely! If you're low on mana, try to use potions or demonic runes / dark runes and just heal the life. If you can afford a respec and find yourself having difficulty killing them - holy nova them.<br /><br />You don't have the time to cast normal or regular heals - heck, I barely even had time to cast flash heals. Once they are near Eris Havenfire, just cast a couple of low rank renews on the ones with low HP and move back to the cave for the next wave - once they have passed her, they are safe.<br /><br />There will be archers positioned on top of the cave - don't try to kill them. It's a waste of your time and your mana.<br /><br />I took a video of my encounter and will probably upload it to filefront and post a link later for it, for those who are still frightened of the quest. :)<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>one thing i d like to add to the very useful hints above:<br /><br />the first wave requires much more healing and curing than the following waves where you have to cocentrate much more on killing the skeletons and staying alive.<br /><br />So use higher rank renews for the first wave and cast a renew right after the dispell. Head back early for the 2nd wave even when the bows are still firing. Every peasant probably has an active renew on him anyway and will survive. In doubt turn around to see if the 2nd wave has spawned. Drink a mana pot before you head back.<br /><br />From then on less healing is required. Just occasionally cast renew and cure desease when neccessary and focus on activating oil of immolation, self shield and heal yourself. Rather use healing pots - you should have enough mana, or use the felwood night dragons for mana.</div>

The reward for this quest is a crappy 5 charge - summon mechanical Yeti to protect you for 10 minutes thing. <br /><br />This little bastard cleared 3 waves of skeletons for me easily while I walked up and down healing peasants.<br /><br />For the last wave of peasants (i completed it in 4 waves) I used &quot;Barov Peasant Caller&quot;. Summons 3 lvl 60 peasants to fight for you for a minute or so. Keep in mind, neither of these toys summoned &quot;The Cleaner&quot; because it doesn't count as someone helping you.<br /><br />Basically I had 3 pots of Immo Oil, and a stack of Holy water from Strat, and didnt have to use any of them, or personally kill a skelly. Summon yeti at the first sign of skellys and forget about them until after the 3rd wave. Enjoy your staff.<br /><br />Edit: 60 Disc/Holy priest - no mana pots - self buffed (fort/spi).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay, I read up on this quest but still ended up failing 3 times in patch 1.10.&nbsp; I'm a holy/disc build, used mana pots, buffs, oils, lower rank spells, etc but still could not do it.<br /><br />After the 3rd time, I was frustrated for myself and for the other priests waiting to do it.&nbsp; So I broke down and hired a Pally.&nbsp; I paid him 10g to just stand in the cave entrance, ungrouped and with retribution aura on.&nbsp; I gave him instructions not to move, attack, or even think about helping.&nbsp; He could heal himself, period.&nbsp; The idea was to get skeletons to aggro onto him and leave my peasants alone.<br /><br />Started quest, skeletons came and prob. half throughout the fight went to him.&nbsp; Well, that half made the difference.&nbsp; I was finally able to finish.&nbsp; He said he couldn't see anything, but invisible things were attacking him.<br /><br />I also used abolish disease, renew 8, and flash heal 6 even though they were more mana.&nbsp; For me, casting all the lower level renews made me have to recast them and just made things more chaotic.&nbsp; I also waited til lots of skeletons were near to holy nova (rank 3) them rather then holy nova two of them while six were incoming.&nbsp; Used no oils in final attempt because I had burned through 20 in my first 3 attempts (doh).<br /><br />Did this today 4/4/06.&nbsp; Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just completed this quest using rank 3 holy novas, which kill all the skellies around you in one hit, so you'll never have to pop a single shield or an oil pot on youself. For healing I used rank 6 renews most of the time, and rank 4 flash heals when they were almost dead, then puting the renew on after, and obvioulsy abolish disease. Second try, first time I let too many die from being late when the new wave of peasants came out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First, calm down. Look at the number of people that have completed this, you will soon be next on the list. Because of the 2 hour quest turn around, I worried and tried to strategize in the interim of each of the 8 times I tried this quest. <br /><br />The most important thing I can suggest is keeping your hot keys just as they are, just a lower rank. Example: rank 6 or 7 Renew, rank 5 Holy Nova (if you have it), Cure Disease (NOT abolish), rank 5 Flash Heal. Having multiple ranks of each spell on your hot keys only serves confuse what you and your fingers are accustom to AND wastes time trying to figure out which spell is where. This is ultimately an exercise in time management, and to a lesser degree mana conservation. Have a Major Mana Potion handy, you will need at least 1, and if you pot early enough, you could use a second. <br /><br />The first wave consists of curing diseases and throwing a HoT on the civilians. The second through fifth wave starts getting tricky: with multiple diseases it is most important that you cure the purple/blue disease off and flash heal them, possibly even a renew. The people with the purple colored disease typically walk faster than the others and therefor MUST be cured and healed first. The green disease does much less damage and these people can be cured and renewed and left alone. <br /><br />Healing people will cause aggro on you (during the second to fifth waves of civilians) and this is where I came into the most trouble. In order to take minimal damgae, use PW: Shield &amp; Defiler's Talisman (if you have) it to minimize the damgae YOU take. Adds will come in waves, Fear the first wave off you and keep curing disease. Use Defiler's Talisman first to allow the timer to reset (you'll use it again) and let the 2nd wave hit you a bit. Wait until you have 2-3 waves of adds on you before you use Strat Holy Water or EZ Thro Dynamtie II (both on the same timer), Oil of Immolation, or my best suggestion is Holy Nova rank 6; it kills them all in 1 hit and heals you a little - which you'll need at that point. <br /><br />Once you get to the quest giver, leave the civilians be (if they are at 50% health they will be fine) and run to the next wave of people. Once you made it past the second wave, you will be fine; it's rinse and repeat at that point.<br /><br />Hit &lt;V&gt; every few seconds to check people's health and to clear the screen to look for new diseases. An over head view makes it easy to tagert individuals with diseases.<br /><br />Do NOT forget to heal yourself, a simple renew between waves and a flash heal during adds should suffice. <br /><br />Gear: I had +healing gear on, NOT +intl or +spir(which is completely useless). <br /><br />Pots: 1 Major Mana Potion, 2 Oil of Immolation (I mostly used Holy Nova rank 5 in order to 1 shot them all). Did Not need anything from Un'Goro or Felwood. <br /><br />Take a breath before you start and do what you normally do in a group or raid: your best. You'll get it ;)<br /><br />Grats</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is not that easy unless you are very well prepared.<br /><br />First of all, if a priest fails the quest, it takes 2 hours before the quest giver respawn. While you wait, you will try to strategize and you may get nervous. Nervosity is your biggest ennemy in this fight.<br /><br />You can do this quest with another priest, BUT, in patch 1.10, the second priest must NOT cast or move AT ALL. Otherwise the big demon will show and kill him. I saw it;)<br /><br />Ok so with all the previous posts, you know pretty much what will happen in this fight. Go see the video. It will give you a good idea of the challenge to come.<br /><br />To get prepared for this fight:<br /><br />- Bring with you dark runes, oil of immolations, major mana potion, and if you can, crystal charges from Un'goro crater (these are stronger than EZ throw dynamite 2). Anything that can do damage without wasting your mana is ideal.<br /><br />- Drag in your shortcut bar Renew level 3 or 4. Don't use your highest Renew spell on the citizens, it would be a mana waste. You can also drag a lower level Flash heal in your bar to heal peasants.<br /><br />- Be prepared to use Power Word: Shield (lvl10) on yourself, and Psychim Scream on the melee undeads.<br /><br />This fight is pretty intense, so organize your shortcuts wisely. <br /><br />Keep in mind these objectives and you will succeed:<br /><br />1- Cure diseases ASAP<br /><br />2- Use the &quot;v&quot; key wisely. It's ideal to see the health bar to heal, but if you try to select a peasant to cure his disease, you may find it difficult with all the health bars up. Click again on the &quot;v&quot; key to hide the health bars. You will have to hit on and off the &quot;v&quot; key constantly in this fight.<br /><br />3- Spam the Renew spell on the peasants. You may not use have to use Flash heals that much anyway; renews.<br /><br />4- As soon as you have around 60-70% of mana, take immediately a major mana potion. This way you should have the chance to take another one.<br /><br />5- When the melee undead comes on you, kill them ASAP. I saw that Holy Nova (highest rank) is pretty effective to kill them one shot.<br /><br />We were two priests in group; the other priest gave me all his Oil of immolation, major mana potion and dark runes. I accepted the quest and did it successfully. The other priest didn't move or cast anything. We both completed the quest and got the Benediction!<br /><br />Awesome epic staff! I even wonder why it's not orange (legendary)!<br /><br />I'm planning to enchant it with +55 healing spells. The Prophecy set has a lot of intellect already.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just completed this quest last night on my second try.<br /><br />My first try I had a warlock, paladin, and priest helping me.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im not impugning any elite priest skills out there.&nbsp; The quest isn't terribly hard, but multiple priests can get Benediction at the same time and it's very easy.<br /><br />Requirements -<br />1. All of you must have the Eye of Divinity and the Eye of Shadow. <br />2. All must equip Eye of Divinity.&nbsp; It will show as a buff.<br />3. Find the ghost priest at 18,20. She's on a little hill.<br />4. One priest accepts the quest from the ghost priest.<br />5. The other priests also accept.<br /><br />To Do<br />1. Only the accepting priest can move.&nbsp; The others should stand stock still on the little hill.&nbsp; Hit the &quot;V&quot; hotkey so you can see the peasant health bars.<br />2. DO NOT HEAL the quest acceptor (the moving priest).&nbsp; If you do The Cleaner (aka Huge Ass Demon aka HAG) will one shot him.&nbsp; Other priests - DO NOT MOVE, or the HAG will kill you.<br />3. Heal and cure the peasants.&nbsp; ALL may do this, only the initial quest acceptor can move, though.&nbsp; It's best if the acceptor does the initial heal by the cave, where the peasants come from.<br />4. Skeletons can be killed with rank 4 Holy Nova.<br />5. Peasants can be cured with rank 4 or 5 Flash Heal, and 4, 5 renew.&nbsp; Use the instant cast cure disease.&nbsp; Cure purple disease immediately.<br />6. You might want a mana pot or two.&nbsp; Other stuff is good, but with multiple priests you won't need it.<br />7.&nbsp; If anyone dies, keep going - as long as the peasants make it you can succeed on the quest.&nbsp; Rez whomever died as soon as you can.<br />8. Get your twig.&nbsp; <br /><br />NOTE- Yetis don't work here anymore.&nbsp; They just stand around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After doing this 7 times, I finally figured out what I needed to do differently to make it work. After the 8th time, I finally got it. All the advice listed here is extremely helpful, but what I found to work the most for me was the advice about Immolation Potions.<br /><br />- <b>Immolation Potions are a must. </b>&nbsp; Take as many as you can, plan to use at least 10 per try.&nbsp; If you become frugal with immolation potions, and don't have the whistle or yeti, you will probably fail.<br /><br />- <b>Major Mana potions + Demonic Rune was essential</b>, since one one of my tries I ran out of mana near the end, and failed.&nbsp; I took them together when my mana was half spent.&nbsp; On the 2nd or 3rd wave, I was full mana again -- pretty much homefree.<br /><br />- <b>The most essential, and timely needed spellcasting in this fight is cure disease</b>. Look for the purple and green auras and tend to them first.&nbsp; I also put a renew on them if they were low, since arrows could take them out. <br /><br />- <b>Renew:</b> The second most important spell to cast is Renew. You will be casting Cure and Renew almost constantly.<br /><br />- <b>Be ready to bubble and renew yourself.</b>&nbsp; When you see skellies come, bubble -- once they get to you, use an immolation potion.&nbsp; The potions are on very short timer, so you can use them within seconds of each other if you need to. Do not be frugal with Immolation potions.&nbsp; Just use them, period.<br /><br />- <b>Interface changes:</b> On my hotbars, I put renew on key 1, cure disease (the higher level one) on key 2. For me, turning on healthbars was was obtrusive.&nbsp; Instead, I remapped my &quot;Tab&quot; key to select nearest allies intead of nearest enemies. I found it easier to scroll through targets with Tab, and press 1 or 2 on my hotbar when appropriate.<br /><br />- <b>Stand in one spot.</b> Try to find the best place to stand during the entire event.&nbsp; You may need 1 try to figure this out, but I was somewhat close to the NPC so I could get her heals, but I was also close enough to each new wave spawn to reach them with my spells.&nbsp; I stood in one spot for almost the entire time -- that was the only time I completed it as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've done this quest twice now with my alliance priest first then my horde priest.<br /><br />The Keys for me were as follows.<br /><br />1. Bind Keys 1,2,3 to Flash Heal Rank 6, Renew Rank 6, Abolish disease, practice with them.<br /><br />2. Bind key 4 to oil of immolation. have a lot on hand. I actually ran out which sucked.<br /><br />3. have major mana pots. dont be shy. use them as SOON as you're down 2000 mana to optimize cooldown.<br /><br />4. get RAID buffs, AB, MOTW, Divine Spirit (if you dont have it)<br /><br />5. Get thorns right before you start.<br /><br />6. Any trinket that damages attackers is a good thing.... like the useless piece of crap ragnaros drops... this might be the only use for it.<br /><br />7. Use the &quot;V&quot; key. Target peasants using the mouse, and the bound heals.<br /><br />8. Have Holy Nova rank 3 as a backup.. its almost enough to kill the skellies with one hit, and it heals you.<br /><br />9. Other potions you might consider - Trolls blood, Armor potion, Mageblood<br /><br />10 Try to do it after getting Onyxia/Nefarian buffs!<br /><br />11 Use Brilliant mana oil<br /><br />12 Nightfin soup for another +8 mana/tick<br /><br />That's it, with that it's not tooooo hard if you focus like mad. You'll get it!</div>

If you have Holy Nova, you don't really need either Oil of Immolation or Yeti.&nbsp; If you don't have Holy Nova, and need either the Oil or the Yeti or both.<br /><br />To start, with your Eye of Divinity equipped, talk to the quest giver (who is in the mountains between Strat and Terrordale).&nbsp; When ready, start quest.<br /><br />Moving between the quest giver and the cave entrance, and either clicking on the peasants or using CTRL-SHIFT:<br />- Abolish Disease on the purple, and then the green aured peasants.<br />- Renew anyone you remove the disease from and anyone else at around 50% life or less<br />- Flash only if someone is really low<br />- Don't forget to flash yourself or renew self if need be (I did once or twice)<br /><br />When the skeleton's come out, don't panic!&nbsp; Just Holy Nova, drink your Oil, or release your Yeti.<br /><br />TIPS:&nbsp; <br />- Drink your first mana pot after you use 2000 mana or so, for me around the middle of the second wave.&nbsp; As soon as the cooldown is finished, drink another one (although I finished before it was necessary).&nbsp; <br />- Dark Runes are nice for a little extra mana, as are Healthstones from a Warlock<br />- You don't have to move too far.&nbsp; Just move up a little on the first wave, and wander back a little with them as they approach the quest giver.&nbsp; Then turn around and repeat.<br /><br />Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I�m going to reinforce a lot of what�s been said already, but also provide my observations, what you really should be using to complete this quest, some information about my gear/stats, and reinforce how manageable this is to do without help. It�s not easy, but not nearly as overwhelming as it first appears<br /><br />First off, know that Oil of Immolation is complete trash. Don�t even contemplate using it. You will be AOEing skeletons down like a mage with only one Rank 3 Holy Nova. I repeat, this spell will one shot every skeleton within range. Let 5 or more collect on you and then AOE. If you nova but missed one, just shield and let them collect on you for the next 30 seconds or so. As soon as they eat through your shield, drop all of them. You�ll be surprised how much time you�ll spend not being attacked and able to concentrate on your heals if you do your best to maximize the amount of skeletons killed per Nova. With Oil of Immolation you have to worry about your health, skeleton adds constantly swarming you, and getting your heals interrupted. With the AOE you will cast it once and clear the screen. I would guess I killed about 2-3 of these skeleton packs per wave, instead of getting swarmed and waiting for them to take damage from oil. If you�ve seen the video you know what I�m talking about. Personally I made managing skeletons my priority so once I wiped a cluster I could concentrate on heals. <br /><br />Second, Decursing is your priority- purple then green. Throw a Renew on anyone that has been cursed. There, I�ve just explained 80% of this test. Personally I used rank 6 renew. I can�t testify if that�s the most ideal rank, but it worked. All over this page people will advocate different ranks. Rank 6 is certainly high enough, but if you�re having mana issues try down-ranking. The cursed peasants will, for the most part, be the only peasants needing your attention. If none are cursed you should just wait for someone to drop below 50%. For the most part you wont need to throw heals on non-cursed peasants. <br /><br />Renew is your best friend. I cast flash heal (rank 5) less than 5 times the entire encounter. Once you clear skeleton packs you will be surprised how little damage the peasants take from the arrows and you can fully concentrate on decursing and renewing those peasants. Renew is plenty of healing. It�s fairly easy to click through them, inspecting their health, giving priority to the ones who get diseased.&nbsp; <br /><br />With that said, I would highly recommend downloading a mod called Tiny Tips. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-4397-1-tinytip.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-4397-1-tinytip.html</a><br /><br />It basically allows your tooltips to appear on whatever you mouse over. So you can see a peasant�s health by just mousing over them instead of clicking. This way you can quickly scan the group and see who�s taking the most damage (hint: usually the guys glowing or getting shot). With their health bars hidden you actually can see the animation which will be a good indication who should be getting heals. Regardless, you�ll be surprised how little healing they�ll actually need once the skeletons are off your rear.<br /><br />As far as buffs go, I wouldn�t really stress out over them. The most important consumables are major mana pots. Use the first one early so you�ll have time to use another one at the end if you need. Personally, I was only self buffed, had MoTW, with Nightfin Soup and a Mageblood potion. No AI from a mage, or Paladin Blessings or Auras (although, if you could get a pally to give you a 15 minute blessing of wisdom, that would probably be a huge help if you�re struggling with mana). Mana regeneration is infinitely more useful than +healing (not helpful for renews and flash heals) so get your highest INT and +mana/5 gear. Honestly if you think you need more buffs/consumables you probably just need more practice, save your gold.<br /><br />I was fairly well geared for this encounter, but not compared to a lot of people. I went in with 3k health, 5.5 mana, +41/5. Not amazing, but substantial<br /><br />If you download Tiny Tip, Decurse /Renew in a timely fashion and Nova to maximize skeleton kills you�ll have a much easier stroll to Benediction. The respawn on the quest giver is apparently only 15 minutes now, so do a number of dry runs to calm your nerves and know what to expect. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A simple guide to the Benediction Quest:<br /><br />Okay, like many of you I had trouble with this at first; but after like 6 attempts at this, I have concluded that luck definatley plays a part. Sometimes, you just get screwed and many archers will all start targeting the same guy and take them down faster than rank 6 renew can handle... Other times, the archers will be stupid and barely hurting anyone at all. <br /><br />I also failed a few times because I was getting too far away from the cave... If you stray too far, the skeletons will spawn and agro on the peasants instead of you, and if they coordinate their efforts, they can take them down pretty fast. You want those skeletons on YOU, and then you want them DEAD (preferably with rank 3 holy nova, if you dont have it, sorry, don;t know what to tell ya)<br /><br />Once the peasants are like 75 &quot;feet&quot; from the &quot;in zone&quot;, if they have over 50% life they generally will make it, even if they are being shot at and dont have a renew on. <br /><br />The key for me was to (in order of priority):<br /><br />A: Stay close enough to the cave so that you can run up to the spawn point and eliminate skeletons with extreme predjudice using rank 3 holy nova(always be ready to get them off peasants immediatley!) As some people have mentioned, its sometimes a good idea to try to gather up alot of skeletons before you nova for mana conservation, but in all honestly, I was a little wasteful and spammed nova sometimes. I still made it.<br /><br />B: Immediatley dispell all diseases, <br /><br />C: THEN if no one is diseased, steadily click thru peasants, using rank 6 renew or RARELY a flash heal (i probably flash healed 3 or 4 times on my succesful attempt, and i used the high rank spell because i hate screwing with alot of low rank stuff) (not a single fire potion or yeti or whatever was used, but stratholme holy water is quite effective if you have it). <br /><br />D: Once they get 75 - 50 feet from the safe zone, I ignore them, and yes a few died; but almost NONE died up near the cave where i was doing all my work.<br /><br />E: As soon as you have used about 2000 mana, drink a major mana potion, and every 2 minutes after that, at least drink a &quot;combat mana potion&quot; (pvp potion from officers barracks)<br /><br />It doesnt really matter which buffs, potions or foods you use, but you probably want to stack up on a few int and regen buffs.<br /><br />I ended up using:<br />1 major mana potion<br />2 combat mana potions<br />1 elixir of greater intellect<br />1 runn tum tuber +10 int food thingie<br />1 lesser mana oil +8 mana regen on weapon<br /><br />Demonic runes and stratholme holy water were quite effective on my failed attempts but I ran out and ended up completing it with the above list.<br /><br />If you don't have holy nova, I would suggest Stratholme holy water, fireshield potions, mechanical yeti, dynamite, peasant caller... ect. And on a personal note, why the hell don't you have holy nova?<br /><br />I had around 6700 mana with all them buffs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did basically what lots of other people who soloed it did.&nbsp; I did it on my second try. I'd have gotten it on my first when i wasnt even trying that hard and didnt use all my buffs, but I had mana issues Second time.

Priest quest only needs one.<br /><br />Hunter quest involves going to four different zones and melee soloing level 60 elite demons. Something the class isn't designed for.<br /><br />Priest quest involves going to one zone and healing/shielding a bunch of friendly npcs, something the class is definitely designed for.<br /><br />Hunter quest reward turns from something only 50% of hunters use into a kind of weapon only 0.5% of hunters use. Attack power bonus that only applies to one specific type of creature.<br /><br />Priest quest reward involves a common weapon for priests that turns from something priests can use a lot soloing into something priests can use a lot in groups.<br /><br />When will people just admit that Blizzard hates hunters and has from the beginning?</div>

I beat the quest with my standard 26/25 Disc/Holy build. You guys need to be more innovative.<br /><br />Secondly, the eye of shadow is going to be dropped off Tainted Scar and Darkwhisper Gorge demons as of next patch. Drop rate is still widely unknown. Hopefully, this coming tuesday but shouldn't be too long.<br /><br />Eye of Divinity is still the rarest drop out of MajorDomo Executus's chest so you guys have fun with that.<br /><br />This is one of the 2 hardest quests in the game. Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>While a sweet staff, why would blizzard not give 2% crit to Shadow where PvP and duels would benefit the most and mana regen to healing when end-game mana regen and consistency is king? 7 per 5 = 84 per min. In a 5 minute fight, that's 420 mana = +28int in pure regen with no cool down. +31 int and +10 stam base stats? Brightwood coughs up better #'s overall. +106 to healing with flash = ~+44 to each flash cast (!). Good staff....not GREAT, but good. I'll slap it on my back when my time comes, but it could be so much more for both the dark and light sides with one fix. If Blizzard corrected what appears to be a gross error, it would be a GREAT staff. As it stands now, Amberseal @ 12 per 5 regen (144/min = 720/5min battle = +48 int in pure regen) and +20 int to start is more usefull long term for healing in the MC/BWL boss fights.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Aug 23 09:32:11 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just a copy n paste 4 all of u as myself looking 4 the quest answer.<br /><br />Got it from wowhealers.com<br /><br />(if Im not allowed 2 do this, pls let me know and just delete post<br /><br />1. Obtain the Eye of Divinity. The Eye of Divinity is a drop from Majordomo's (Level 500 elite mob) chest. Majordomo can be found in the Molten Core instance, which is in Blackrock Depths. Level 55+. You have to complete the following steps in order to get Majordomo Executus to spawn (Thanks Mythisafk!).<br /><br />Get 7 to 8 people to complete the following Quests from Duke Hydraxis in Azshara <br /><br />Poisoned Water <br />Stormers and Rumblers <br />Eye of the Emberseer <br />The Molten Core<br />Agent of Hyraxis <br />Hands of the Enemy <br /><br />Hands of the Enemy requires you to collect the hands of Lucifron, Gehennas, Shazzrah and Sulfuron. <br /><br />After completing the quest you get a Vial which can be used douse one of the seven or eight flame traps in Molten Core. Technically, you only need one person to complete the quest, but it's easier with seven or eight people with one vial each. <br /><br />Each flame trap is guarded by: <br />Lucifron<br />Magmadar <br />Gehennas <br />Garr <br />Baron Geddon <br />Shazzrah <br />Sulfuron <br />Golemagg <br /><br />After spawning Majordomo you have to force him to submit by killing his eight guards at the same time while tanking Majordomo himself. After he submits a chest will appear. You only have five minutes to open the chest and loot items before it despawns. <br /><br />Basically it takes a 40 man crew two days normally to clear Majordomo. The Eye drops roughly 40% of the time. Only one eye will drop, so you'll have to kill Majordomo once per Priest. The eye is bind on pickup however. Equip the eye and use it to obtain a clue. Follow the clue to the next step.<br /><br />2. Obtain the Splinter of Nordrassil. <br />A guide to completing the Epic Priest quest event <br />By: Paladeus (Immortality – Skullcrusher)<br /><br />Upon obtaining the eye of divinity from Major Domo’s chest, the priest must equip it in order to gain a clue as to where the quest will take him. The eye tells the tale of a sole priest who failed in saving fleeing peasants from the onslaught of an UD invasion.<br />…you must make up for what she could not do!<br /><br />First, head to the Stratholme area and find the NPC. She is located due west of Stratholme after passing thru a cave, on the left side. If you reach the Terrorweb tunnel, you’ve gone too far! She can ONLY be seen when the eye of divinity is equipped. She will tell you her tale, after which the quest will appear that if you accept, will begin the event that you must succeed in!<br /><br />The Event:<br />Note: you must keep the eye of divinity EQUIPPED for the entire duration of the event<br /><br />You have to save the lives of 50 peasants before 15 die. The peasants will spawn in groups of 10 near the cave to the East. In order to “save” them, the peasants must reach the area near the NPC. While the peasants are traveling from the cave to this point, they will be fired upon by UD archers which CANNOT be killed, melee’d by UD warriors (which in turn melee you), and sporadically given a disease (which appears as a green cloud) that must be cured ASAP as it eats away their life very quickly.<br /><br />How to beat it:<br /><br /> (The items, buffs, and people you might want /need when you attempt it)<br /><br />A group of 5 people, consisting of you, 2 paladins, a warlock and a mage…the people you bring with you MUST STAND ON TOP OF THE NPC and never move, as it will cause you to fail the quest. However, from this place, the auras and such will still reach you and be of GREAT use. Granted, not all of the below things are “needed”, but with the 2 hour wait between attempts, it might be nice to have a good shot at it in one try. <br /><br />Auras:<br />Concentration Aura OR Devotion Aura<br />Retribution Aura<br />Blood Pact (warlock Imp)<br /><br />Buffs (both spell and item buffs)<br />Improved Fortitude<br />Inner Fire<br />Arcane Intellect<br />Mark of the Wild<br />Blessing of Kings<br />Blessing of Wisdom<br />Thorns Aura (or the crystal form of it from Ungoro crystal towers)<br />Divine Spirit (or the crystal form of it from Ungoro crystal towers)<br />Cerebral Cortex Compound (+50 intellect, quest in Blasted Lands that’s repeatable)<br />Rum Tum Tuber Surprise (10 int)<br />Nightfin Soup (mana / 5 sec regen)<br />Wildblossom berries (10 stam)<br /><br />Items<br /><br />OIL OF IMMOLATION (this is by far a must have to complete this quest easily!)<br />Mana / Health Potions<br />Demonic Runes (sacrifices life and give you mana – from demons in felwood)<br />Whipper Root Tubers (restore health - from felwood)<br />Nightdragon Plants(restore small health and mana - from felwood)<br /><br />There are some very key things that should be noted about the event that will help you tremendously when attempting it.<br /><br />Manually targeting the peasants to heal them can be a pain! In order to alleviate this, make sure to have their health bars displayed above their heads (by pressing hotkey “V”) and also targeting them by clicking their health bars, not their bodies!<br />When the waves of peasants spawn, there will be a few in the front of the pack that almost have a “purple” glow to them. These peasants are extremely weak and must be cured and healed immediately or they will die. This can easily cause the priest to fail the quest when they first attempt it, as I did.<br />Right before the first wave of peasants reaches the safe point (and every group thereafter), the next group will spawn. Therefore, it is imperative that you turn around and head back towards the cave and be ready to heal those weak peasants in the front first. In addition, the second wave of peasants will cause the UD melee warriors to spawn. I found it best to FEAR (yes they CAN be feared) this initial group of warriors as it allowed me to compose myself, heal the very weak peasants, and in turn gain their agro so they weren’t targeting peasants. I did this every time a new wave spawned.<br />When Melee UD warriors engage you (and they will, after you pop one heal on a peasant) Activate your Oil of Immolation! These potions have no cool down between uses and grant you the chance to deal tons of damage to melee things attacking you. Combined with the auras listed above, the UD fighters (which don’t have much health) will die after 1-2 swings at you, saving your mana from having you use it on healing yourself.<br />It’s a good idea to hotkey Flash heal (rank 6 or 7, depending on how much bonus +healing you have, ONE of these will fully heal the peasant), Renew rank 9, and abolish disease to keys right next to each other…such as 1, 2 and 3. These will be the only spells you will use on the peasants and you need to use them in rapid succession. AOE heal does not work, nor do you have the time to cast a spell that long.<br />Using Renew on peasants around ½ health as they near the NPC is a good strategy as it allows you to not worry about their health and in turn focus on the next group that’s about to spawn.<br />Use Health / Mana Potions frequently, renew, and divine prayer (if you have it) to heal yourself if needed. Do not waste time healing yourself with cast time spells as it will make keeping the peasants alive that much more difficult.<br />Your friends that are there for support / giving you the buffs CANNOT see the NPC’s. So, as hard as it might be for them, you must convince them NOT to move as to them, you’ll be running around alone taking damage and healing nothing!<br />All told, you should count on their being at least 6 waves of peasants, as some will die here and there…it is unavoidable. Upon completing the event, you gain the Splinter of Nordrassil, that when used will form the Benediction Staff as long as you also posses the Eye of Shadow! (which can be obtained by killing Kazzak, an outdoor raid boss in the blasted lands, or by farming high level demons for it) <br /><br />Best of Luck to all of you who attempt it!<br /><br />3. Obtain the Eye of Shadow. The Eye of Shadow drops off of Lord Kazzak, a very powerful elite boss in the Blasted Lands. Bring a raid group. Currently, you MUST be in the kill group in order to loot the Eye. Tigole says they plan to change this so you can loot the Eye even if you're not in the raid group. Update from Tregga: Well it seems Tigole was mistaken about the impending change. He just came back and said you will have to be in the group that tags Kazzak in order to have a chance to loot it. However, it was not intended to have the Priest epic quest loot only drop from raid encounters. The devs are looking into alternate methods for Priests to get the drops required for the epic quest.<br /><br />Tips for fighting Lord Kazzak (Taken from Elenandaron's post on the Thottbot.com's boards) :<br /><br />First of all, his attacks: <br /><br />Melee <br />His melee attacks are pretty weak, no more than 1500 hits on cloth users. <br /><br />'Shadowbolt Volley' <br />Shoots out an insanely long range volley of Shadowbolts that damage anything it can target in distance for 800-1000 damage. The volley totally ignores all line of sight issues: it cannot be dodged. <br /><br />Twisted Reflection <br />Casts a magical debuff (on a random player in range other than the player with aggro) that heals Lord Kazzak for 25,000 health each time he deals damage to the player with this debuff. This combined with the Shadowbolt Volley can ruin the attempt. <br /><br />Mark of Kazzak <br />Casts a curse (on a random player in range with mana) that drains the target's mana for 250 per second and explodes for 4,000 AOE damage when there is no more mana to drain. A living bomb. <br /><br />Cleave <br />Attacks a number of melee range players around him with a cleaving strike that deals 1000-2000 damage to each. Since a 'blind spot' has not been found, Cleave might be capped to a certain number of players affected. <br /><br />Thunderclap <br />A point blank area of effect spell, hardly dealing any damage, but slowing movement speed. Some have reported 200 damage, some say it doesn't deal damage at all. Doesn't seem to affect attacking speed either. <br /><br />Void Bolt <br />A strong bolt he may cast only on the player with aggro, deals up to 3000 shadow damage (or more!). <br /><br />Capture Soul <br />When a player, pet or totem gets killed, Lord Kazzak casts this spell to instantly regenerate 70,000 health. <br /><br />Alright, now you know pretty well what you're fighting against. Here's how the battle itself works: <br /><br />Once he is aggroed and the fight begins, you have no more than three (3) minutes to kill him. I'll explain later why. He starts off with everything he's got. He keeps meleeing the main tank while Cleaving once in a while for rogues swarming around him and keeps sending Shadowbolt Volleys to hurt everyone around. The volleys are not on a timer, instead he casts them as he sees fit. In some rare cases there's about 30 seconds between the casts, sometimes he does it every five seconds. In the meantime, he casts Twisted Reflection and the rarer Mark of Kazzak on random people. <br /><br />What to do here: <br />Send your main tank in and let him build some aggro for a short while, just enough so he won't come at you the first time you cast something on him. Then unload. Have your DPS classes give him everything they have. Priests have to be extra mindful about the magical debuff he casts on your group. It has to be removed as soon as possible or the attempt will soon end in a disaster. Priests are also in charge of healing their groups thanks to that Shadowbolt Volley that keeps hitting everyone all the time. Mages need to be on top of the curse situtation. Mark of Kazzak can and will cause a wipe if you let it go off on you. Dispel the curse as soon as you can. All casters should also leave about 1000 mana in their mana pool just in case he casts the curse on you. That'll give the mages four seconds to dispel before it goes off. In other words, 1000 mana is out of mana in this raid encounter. Also, anyone dying during the fight is not an option. Unless it happens during the first five seconds of the fight, you've failed already. Do not use grounding totems, pets or other small things he can kill for the 70,000 health heal. <br /><br />Your group will have exactly three minutes to finish the demon off. If you fail to kill him in that time due to lack of DPS, people dying or not dispelling Twisted Reflection properly, Lord Kazzak will enter what is called the supreme mode. Named after his yell once it triggers, the supreme mode causes him to cast his Shadowbolt every second. That's 800-1000 DPS on everyone, kids, and that means a wipe.<br /><br />4. Combine the 3 items. Once you have all 3 items, combine them to form your new epic staff, Anathema/Benediction. Using one form of the staff will change it to the other and visa versa. Congratulations! You're completed your Priest epic quest! <br /><br />Update from Tregga: Right now either side can be enchanted but you lose any enchantments for good if you switch versions. The problem apparently is that when you switch the forms of the staff from one to the other, you're essentially destroying one staff and having a new copy of the other version of your staff added to your inventory. 7/20/05- This bug is still an issue after the 1.6.0 patch was released. There are no updates or estimates on a fix at this time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rudy199</b></h3>This is extremely easy to obtain now in Classic, many priests already walking around with this. I don't think it was the case in early Vanilla years back.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Antritha</b></h3>Not sure if it will help anyone but here is my input as far as Classic goes.<br /><br />3500 Health and 5100 Mana. <br /><br />No buffs from anyone or any consumable. <br />No Strat Holy water.<br />No oil of immolation.<br />No outside help or party members with me in any form.<br /><br />Figured I would give it a go to remember how the event went, fail it and then go do my errands. Come home and farm/buy everything I needed as well as get some guild members to sit at cave entrance and help me.<br /><br />Buffed myself with Fort and Spirit as well is Inner Fire. SUMMONED MECHANICAL YETI. Started quest. I used the following spells.<br />Abolish<br />Flash Heal R4<br />Renew R5<br />Holy Nova R3<br />Priority was:<br />1. Abolish Purple<br />2. Abolish Green<br />3. Renew anyone 50%-75% (these will be the ones you didnt abolish fast enough or are getting focused on by archers from my experience) then forget about them<br />4. Flash Heal anyone sub 30% then forget about them<br /><br />After these 4 things, I cast max renew on myself as needed. I believe I had to do this 4 times. I shielded one time right at the beginning and then did not use at all rest of the event. <br />I let my Yeti tank/kill everything. He was amazing. He lasted the entire event. He dispatched roughly 75% of all skeletons. When there was a group of 5 or more around me/Yeti then I used Holy Nova R3 and it killed everything. I used this roughly 5 times in total starting after the third wave. Yeti took care of everything else all on his own.<br />I used one demonic rune at about 50% mana. Did not use another nor any many pot or any other consumable the entire event. <br /><br />I finished VERY easy. I was surprised actually as I was just doing this to get the idea on my head before &quot;officially&quot; doing it later. I was at full health and a bit over 50% mana when I finished.<br /><br />As for position and strategy, I followed the rest of the posts. Stayed about half way between quest giver and cave and did my moving around in that general zone. It was primarily to move and see the health bars or to be able to select targets to heal/abolish. Once I got the group to the quest giver and ensured disease did not get renewed on any of them as well as make sure they were above 1/3 health I forgot about them and moved to the cave for next group. I payed VERY LITTLE attention to skeletons. Yeti did all the work with me doing a Holy Nova about 5 times in total on large grouped packs. <br /><br />In my opinion this was SUPER easy and completely due to Mechanical Yeti. So if you have him in the bank or have not done the quest then I suggest going this path. No stress, no rushing, no managing consumables.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>griffjen</b></h3>THIS IS HOW YOU DO THE QUEST IN CLASSIC: I'm posting this here because wowhead won't let me post a comment on the Tips Out guide page. Fix it please!<br />Some of the info in that guide is outdated or just plain wrong. Remember to always double check the info in this site and never trust tips out. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about lol.<br /><br />First off, Eris Havenfire’s rez timer is not 2 hours and hasn’t been for over a decade. It’s only 15 minutes. He only despawns if you lose or die, if you succeed he will stay there.<br />Because of this you don’t need to bring a friend with you to summon the cleaner. Whether you lose or die to the cleaner, Eris’ rez timer will be the same. <br /><br />I did this with about 5000 mana. I had some consumes, but as long as your mana is 5000+ you should be fine. Wear gear with intellect and mp5. Mana management is the most important thing in completing the challenge. Bring 3 major mana potions (or a bunch more if it’s your first try). Pop one at half mana and then the others when you need them. Use inner focus when it’s up. Cast flash heal rank 4 on the peasants and abolish disease on the ones with purple and green clouds. Prioritize purple, green is not as big of a deal. Once the peasants are at the end get back to the cave opening fast to meet the next wave. Wait for the skeletons to group up you and then cast holy nova rank 4 on them or use strat holy water if you are low on mana. I didn’t have thorns but I can see how it would be helpful here. I also didn’t have Second Wind but that trinket is super useful here. If you use Second Wind you probably only need 2 mana pots.<br /><br />Just heal up peasants as they lose health, don’t worry too much if a few die, always make sure to get back to meet the next wave when they spawn. You got this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mervvvvvvvv</b></h3>Make this so much easier on yourself and skip the whole Oil of Immolation/Mechanical Yeti/Thorns business and use rank 3 Holy Nova instead. It will one-shot the skeles and give you a small heal. Let at least 4 of them stack on you and then wipe them clean. Then you can focus on keeping a rank 7-9 renew on any of the citizens who fall below 75%. 2-3 mana pots will def make this a breeze. You got this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ayydre</b></h3>Side note: you must keep the Eye of Divinity Trinket equipped throughout the encounter. I accepted &quot;The Balance of Light and Shadow&quot; quest from Eris, and once the event started I switched out the trinket to get a little more firepower. This made all the peasants invisible and i promptly failed the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Goyke</b></h3>Completed this today. With a different approach that worked really well, with help, and no Mana pots or Runes consumed.<br /><br />Found a priest who already attempting the quest and had failed. We provided some buffs and a Mage Blizzard and she was able to complete it. I did try to join in, and the Quest Giver asked me if I wanted to join my Priest Party member, but I was instantly killed by the cleaner. Not many Skellys caused any bother.<br /><br />When it was my turn, the Priest from earlier stood 2 paces behind Eris, and healed the Peasants as they walked past Eris, this allowed me to run back and start looking after the new wave. With the Mage help, and a Paladin providing an Aura, and my Priest friend, I completed the quest with virtually no damage and around half my Mana left.<br /><br />I have good MP5 gear, giving me +45 and INT and Mana regen Buffs.<br /><br />Previously I had failed a few times, so I was grateful for the help and sharing a successful strategy so others may not fail it as much as I did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JappersMcJappers</b></h3>THIS IS A CLASSIC WOW 2020 COMMENT.<br /><br />I just completed the quest to obtain Benediction on my Priest. As a first time WoW player with classic i found the quest to be quite challenging! and i think i may know why. <br />The quest requires you to Cure Diseases and Heal waves of peasants as they try to survive a short gauntlet of arrow fire and low health skeletons to safety. <br /><br />As a Priest who began his healing career making use of an addon called &quot;Healbot&quot; i had almost ZERO experience when it came to TARGETING then casting the appropriate spell. Healbot is all mouse-over clicking! I took about 3 runs to &quot;unlearn&quot; my habitual healing mouse-over habits. Just a friendly heads up for other Healbot users out there =]<br /><br />A few tips for people struggling which made my 4th (and successful) attempt very easy. <br /><br />1. BRING YOUR MAGE BUDDY! I cannot stress enough how much of a difference having extra Mana on this quest helps. The entire quest is basically a clinic on manapool management, having straight up more Mana is a HUGE help for this. Secondly, if you are REALLY struggling with this quest, your mage friend can also help clear out the skeletons by standing on the hill next to Eris Havenfire and casting Blizzard or Arcane Explosion at the choke point. We have tried this 3 different times, all 3 times the Cleaner was NOT spawned and the mage was able to instantly clear the melee skeleton mobs. As long as the mage stays clear of the &quot;path&quot; the peasants are on the Cleaner will not trigger.<br /><br />2. Immolation Potions&gt; Holy Nova rank 4. <br />While Holy Nova will instantly clear the wave of skeletons, it is a very Mana intensive spell. I found myself panicking &amp; casting Holy Nova instead of popping another Immolation and wanding once or twice. Holy Nova ONLY if you are about to die.<br /><br />2. Heal Rank 2&gt; Flash Heal rank 4. <br />My first 3 attempts i was using Flash Heal rank 4. I found myself popping Major Mana potions much too quickly, while also using up 2 dark runes just to stay ahead mana wise. Once i switched to using Heal rank 2 it made all the difference in the world. Heal rank 2 when peasants are getting low or even using Renew Rank 6-9 on targets taking damage but are above 50% HP was enough to get them across the finish line. Don't waste your attempts like I did using Flash Heal. Just take it off your bar for this one. <br /><br />3. Druid friend with Thorns spell.<br />Having a druid buddy come along can be a HUGE help with the skeleton mobs. Park your druid buddy at the mouth of the cave in Bear form with Thorns active. They will pull aggro from the melee skeletons and quickly kill them with Thorns. It was such a HUGE help, this cannot be understated. My first two attempts where fails simply because i died to melee skeletons.<br /><br />4. Addon's/Nameplates.<br />On my first attempt I had a very hard time with the visual clarity of who i needed to target/cure. I ended up using an addon called &quot;KuiNameplates&quot; which i found to be extremely helpful when it comes to targeting the correct peasant. This addon will give you a much cleaner healthbar as well as debuff icons next to the name, so you can instantly tell which targets to Cure. It can also be helpful to turn off &quot;stacking nameplates&quot;<br /><br />Random side notes.<br /> 1) Eris Havenfire respawns in about 15 mins ALWAYS. I failed, i died, i triggered cleaner and every time she respawned in about 15 mins. Never waited 2hrs like some have suggested.<br /><br />2) I spent WAY too much gold on consumables. It will be different for everyone, but on my successful run i used: 2 Major Mana Potions, 5 Immolation Potions, 1 Nightfin Soup with about 5200 Manapool after Buffs. Bought 5 Dark Runes which are still chillin in my bags sad face.<br /><br />I decided to write this up in hopes of helping out any other new Priests (like me) out there who have failed this a couple of times and might be feeling a little discouraged. I know this quest definitely challenged me in a way Classic Wow hadn't before and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Good luck and enjoy that amazing staff!</div>
