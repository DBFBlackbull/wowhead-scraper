<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Koterulezz</b></h3>I'm pretty sure actual drop chance is more like 2.5%, not 25%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tero55</b></h3>The drop rate is not 24% but more like 2-3%, so unless you are skinner you are wasting your time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Reunahana</b></h3>Killed around 30 of them to get both horns. Good luck i guess. <br />Cave is filled with mobs!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KromirSilvermoon</b></h3>I spent ages clearing the cave and think I killed least 50 of these yetis (matriarchs/ patriarchs)<br /><br />Weirdly my 2 pristine horns dropped for me on two separate loots at the exact same location - deep inside the cave and at the bottom in a sort of cavern area - 70.20 38.77 on my tomtom. So I would suggest going there if you're struggling to get drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zabiralka</b></h3>I was grinding the Matriarchs outside the cave for ages with no drops. Went in the cave and within 10 minutes had both horns, one from a Matriarch and one from a Patriarch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Birdman3310</b></h3>Drop rate doesn't change either inside or outside the cave. It's roughly a 25% chance each one you kill. The end <br /><br />I've done this quest on multiple characters. I've had great luck, I've had normal luck, and I've had terrible luck. \<br /><br />Just sit back, keep killing, they will drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rostkebab</b></h3>Took 27 pat/mat, very bad drop rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomboclad</b></h3>30 yetis only 1 pristine horn. This game is cooked</div>
