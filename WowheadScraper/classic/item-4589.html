<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>that's becuase your an alliance, for the Horde faction Hinterland is the best place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was farming the Hideskinners in Hinterlands on Saturday for a bit. In half an hour, I only got two drops, and I was blowing through them in a non-stop farming spree with no down time (they respawn fast).<br /><br />I'm going to try Azshara tonight, as the drop rate has got to be better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to let everyone know, I get one of these and/or Undamaged Hippogryph feather from about 60% of the hippogryphs I've killed in Azshara.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I spent an hour killing those hippogryphs in Feralas and only got 3 feathers -- way too hard!<br /><br />When I checked the AH I found the feathers selling for 5g for 6 feathers!&nbsp; that's insane, so I figured I'd go farm some more.<br /><br />This morning I decided to check the AH again and found 7 feathers for 70s buyout :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dropped off the Wildkin in Hinterlands...slow drop rate but hope this helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I killed 105 hippogryphs (kept an accurate tally) in Azshara and got 40 feathers. So in Azshara that means the drop rate is 38%.<br /><br />I'm a level 60 rogue and killed these with great ease. I went between battlegrounds<br /><br />Thuban, Alliance<br />Emerald Dream</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There's a single wild gryphon in hillsbrad that alliance can kill to get this, and it has about a 1/3&nbsp; drop rate. If you're trying to get 6 it's going to take some time :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'd be lucky if the drop from the razorbeaks in hinterlands was 1 in ten, damn thigs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found the drop rate of these feathers in Feralas is just as bad if worse than the rate in Hinterlands.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>those droprates can't possibly be right, it took me ages to get those feathers drop of these trolls, and I killed quite a deal of those hippos and never got one feather drop of those.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>That is a truly awful droprate. Got bored of trying to get past all the wolves to the gryphons, so went to Feralas to farm hippogryphs. It took me 20k exp worth of kills to get the 9 feathers I needed (having bought one on the AH), and considering half the time I wasn't rested, so only getting 200 exp per kill, that's a low droprate.<br /><br />Absolutely kicking myself for vendoring a bunch of these feathers while I was doing the Feralas quests with hippogryphs a few levels back! ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate is better on the Thunderheads there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There is only one wild gryphon spawn.<br />It will spawn in various locations behind durnholde keep but only one will ever be on map at a time, so you have to wait for the corpse to despawn (5-6min) for another to spawn.<br /><br />The two named gryph's guarding path to hinterlands are ironforge faction, so alliance cannot kill them.<br /><br />Drop rate is decent however if you are willing to endure the boredom.</div>
