(if offtanks have the proper position, they get really few damage, so a good portion of the rage used is gained from damage done).\n\nofc this weapon is not the solution for all the end game encounters, but for melee fights is very good. and trust a tank on this.. weapon speed is important but not in all fights.","date":"2006-02-06T00:44:19-06:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Adriga","importedSubject":"switching gear when needed"},{"commentv2":1,"number":8,"id":2711790,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I just picked this up, so I have yet to do testing, but I know it is going to be better than quel.\n\nWeapon speed only matters for ONE fight in endgame tanking. That is Vael. Because that is the only fight that gives you enough rage to throw a HS on every weapon swing.\n\nThe only reason a fast weapon can ever generate more rage than a slower one with equal dps is because of Unbriddled Wrath.\n\nSpineshatter = 54.5+( (9*2)\/14 from the str) = 55.8 dps\nBloodlord's = 48.2\n\nNow, rage generation is damage\/(0.5*level). Ignoring atk power bonus from other gear and crit chance (as that will be identical with the two weapons), that leaves us with the following rage\/second numbers. Also note that rage generation is purely based on dps, independent of weapon speed.\n\nSpineshatter = 55.8\/(0.5*60) = 1.86 rage\/second\nBloodlord's = 48.2\/(0.5*60) = 1.61 rage\/second\nQuel'Serrar = 52.5\/(0.5*60) = 1.75 rage\/second\n\nNow, assume the tank has unbriddled wrath. That is 40% chance to get 1 rage on a melee hit.\n\nSpineshatter = 1.86 + 0.4\/2.6 = 2.01 rage\/second\nBloodlord's = 1.61 + 0.4\/1.9 = 1.82 rage\/second\nQuel'Serrar = 1.75 + 0.4\/2 = 1.95 rage\/second\n\nNow that we have gotten the rage generation straight, lets move on to aggro.\n\nAggro is only dependent on the weapon for Heroic Strike (HS). All other abilites are identical, regardless of weapon.\n\nA few philosophical considerations. When using HS as ragedump, it is assumed that the rage cannot be used for anything else that generates aggro. This is based on the fact that HS offers a limited increase in aggro over a sunder and that a HS prevents rage generation from the normal swing it replaces.\n\nAdd to that the fact that anyone who tanks endgame knows that the amount of situations where you have unlimited rage is very sparse. And in any situation where you do not have more rage than you can dump with HS using a 2.6 weapon, using a 1.9 speed weapon will not help.\n\nHS aggro generation is equal to a sunder+the damage caused. So in an ideal situation with unlimited rage the threat difference between the 3 weapons will be the following (ignoring generation from any other abilites as that will be identical, assuming unlimited rage).\n\nSpineshatter = 55.8 + (138+260)\/2.6 = 208.9 threat\/second\nBloodlord's = 48.2 + (138+260)\/1.9 = 257.7 threat\/second\nQuel'Serrar = 52.5 + (138+260)\/2 = 251.5 threat\/second\nEskhandar's Right Claw = 48 + (138+260)\/1.5 = 313.3 threat second\n\nThese numbers show that in ideal unlimited rage situations, faster weapons are better. The bloodlord's will win over the spineshatter. However, that only happens during the Vael fight, and Eskhandar's Claw smacks anything else in terms of aggro generation on that fight.\n\nNow, going back to the rage generation numbers, Spineshatter does generate 10% more rage than Bloodlord's. That roughly translates to 10% more sunders in a fight where rage is limited. Of course incoming damage is the biggest source, but that will be the same for both weapons. On top of that, Spineshatter does 7.6 more dps than Bloodlord's, which adds directly to threat generation.\n\nOn a tank with defiance and comparing to a rogue with salvation. 7.6 dps more on the tank's weapon will allow the rogue to do 17 dps more before pulling aggro. Now multiply those 15'ish dps with a whole raid worth of dps classes and you get something like +300 raid dps simply from using Spineshatter over Bloodlord's (very rough and inaccurate numbers, but the point is valid). When you do endgame, the aggro limits and raid dps is what matters. And the speed of the weapon has no effect on this at all.\n\nThe stats are comparable, but in some cases 10 hp and 1 defense does matter. And with the amount of damage coming from non-physical sources in endgame, I would value 10 hp higher than 80 armor.\nAlso, do not forget that 9 str adds 0.45 block value. Not a lot, but it does add up.\n\nTo sum it up, Spineshatter is the best endgame tanking weapon. Although the differences between the 3 of the \"top\" ones is not really worth wanting one over the other for, unless you need the stamina increase going from Quel to Spineshatter.\nSure, if you suck at tanking and dont know how to manage your rage\/mobs, then a faster weapon does make tanking easier. However, if you know what you are doing, the speed of the weapon should make no difference.","date":"2006-03-14T12:44:19-06:00","rating":64,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Qreeek","importedSubject":"Tanking weapon speed."},{"commentv2":1,"number":9,"id":2711799,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Iam a 60 Warrior full Might, Drill, and this mace I MT for my raid group and saying this mace sucks for tanking makes u sound like a complete idiot I used to have Quel then had the highest dkp for this and I hold aggro even better with this. yes I aggree its good for Rogues as well but saying its a crap weapon for tanking&nbsp; is just stupid...Warriors have first dibs on this then Rogues(Defense, Stamina, Strength= Tanking stats) This is the best tanking weapon in game","date":"2006-04-20T00:44:19-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Jayyodogdoubleq","importedSubject":"60 Rogue post"},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":2711808,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"We seriously need to get the gold farming pricks off Thottbot. &*!@ing jerkoff prick %^&*!@# children who've had their parents buy gold and a 60 char now equipped in BoE epics and Superiors are starting to infest the server i'm on.

Faster weapons are the best now b\/c all weapons are locked on the same speed for the special moves SO GHEY. \n\nTHERE IS NO DEPTH TO THE GAME ANYMORE \n\nSo bottom line is we will never hit the high crits and dps like we once did this is such BS. Today was a sad day =*( \n\nworld of warcraft can kiss my _ _ _ guess its back to DAoC 4 me. \n\nWhen i say no DEPTH i mean on weapon selection. All anyone is going to try 4 now is the fastest weapon they can get their hands on to only come up short of what we once did. B4 if u were another class u would want the fast weapon like a hunter now we will all be going for the fast weapons with the most dps and the slow ones have no use. The slow speed bonus is no more that means no DEPTH and we have been GIMPED. plz dont be a sheep stand up 4 something. We did not deserve a nerf of any sort we already were not the damage dealers (ROGUES) as we were suppose to be as defined in the book. \n\nIn conclusion BLIZZARD should have fixed the blue weapons that were causing the prob and left the system how it was.","date":"2005-11-04T22:39:20-06:00","rating":-14,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Cry more newb...","creationdate":"2006-01-13T00:54:16-06:00","id":1282795,"rating":0,"commentid":3074337,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"frostyflames","importedSubject":"RE: patch 1.8 Grrr"},{"body":"How in God's Name can you write a seemingly intelligent post, spell out words, use punctuation and create paragraphs and STILL use \"4\" instead of \"for\".\n\nYou have failed at life - die please.\n\nEdited, Wed Jan 25 08:05:31 2006","creationdate":"2006-01-25T14:05:02-06:00","id":1282794,"rating":1,"commentid":3074337,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Crispian","importedSubject":"RE: patch 1.8 Grrr"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Brutetacuss","importedSubject":"patch 1.8 Grrr"},{"commentv2":1,"number":43,"id":3074338,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Imo if you have Quel or even B.Defender dont spend dkp on this.

As it turns out, I was fortunate enough to win the Spineshatter tonight.  As far as Quel-vs-Spine comparisons...each weapon has its own advantages and both are very nice tanking weapons.\n\nThe Quel is much faster which will allow warriors to use Heroic Strike during sunder cooldowns to generate large amounts of agro.  This is especially useful for certain boss encounters such as Vaelastrasz where rage is unlimited and generating large amounts of agro quickly is key.  The proc on the Quel is very nice for tanking as well.  The weak top damage of the Quel won't matter as much with the weapon changes in 1.8.  But these changes won't effect prot warriors much anyways since their main instant attack (shield slam) isnt affected by weapon dps\/speed.\n\nThe Spineshatter has +5 defense on it.  And with the 1.7 defense nerf, warriors are looking to get defense where ever they can.  Defense on a weapon is rare enough, so this alone make the Spineshatter appealing.  The Spineshatter also has more stamina and +9 strength that the Quel doesn't have. On top of this, the Spineshatter is much easier to get (if your guild can take down raz).\n\nBoth are very nice weapons for tanking.  I'd say the Quel is probably a better tanking weapon for Arms warriors since they lack the defiance talent and need a fast weapon for the added agro of HS spam.  But for me I prefer the stats and overall white damage of the Spineshatter.  With the recent improvement of Shield Slam, prot wars don't need HS to build tons of agro.","date":"2005-09-27T05:09:58-05:00","rating":21,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"kabili","importedSubject":"Spineshatter"},{"commentv2":1,"number":47,"id":3074342,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I'm going to pick one of these up asap, i'm a 31\/5\/15 spec and currently use a Brutality Blade when I have to tank.

It's really up to personal preference, but most people use either Spineshatter, Bloodlord's Defender, or the Quel'Serrar. All are great for tanking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>...this is no random world drop. It's a high lvl instance drop that you need to do with an organized group. If any guild/raid leaders let a rogue roll on this weapon, they are out of their good minds and shouldn't be in the position to lead %^&amp;* to begin with.<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Most warriors use swords? Why? At the moment i use timeworn mace, not because of dmg or anything, it has around 40dps which is average. <br /><br />Maces are probably THE best tanking weapons in the game, Timeworn has +7 str, +11 stam and 120 armour, find me a sword that has those stats. This mace probably beats Quel'serrar. <br /><br />I mean whats better, having +7 defence all the time.. or having to worry about when your weapon is going to proc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a Prime weapon for warriors with every single stat they benefit from on it. In our guild 5 of our warriors have this already so If a rogue wants to try it out let him spend DKP instead of it getting DE'd. If a warrior NEEDS this it should automatically go to that person regaurdless. IF they are a protection spec.<br /><br />I have a 60 war / rogue so :P im immune to stupid comments :P.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I MT for my guild and I'd definitley pass this to a rogue, pally/shammy, fury warrior maybe, hell even a feral druid.<br /><br />Simple reason, as stated earlier in this thread, is that it's too slow to effectively use heroic strike. Just because it has defense on it dosen't automatically make it a tank weapon.<br /><br />For up and coming MT's, you want something around 2.00 attack speed. Once you've built up sunder and revenge aggro, you can time your heroic strikes where it almost seems like it's an instant attack instead of standing there waiting for your next swing. Great way to dump rage while doing good dmg and still creating high aggro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Cant wait till i get this :)<br />Only one more warrior in my guild might need a tanking weapon then its&nbsp; mine, all mine.<br /><br />Lvl 60 shaman of Korgall<br /><br />Some info: Were a guild thats been farming Nef for a few months now, our main tank has passed this twice, the 2 warrs who took it went back to Quell in about a week or 2 of trying it in Zg and such... Since i dont rely on rage generation to get agro i dont care about the weapon speed only DPS :)<br /><br />Oh and before you start yelling that shamans cant tank, I know we cant tank stuff ZG and up, but I have succesfully tanked Drakki on a few occasions and constantly farm DM and Scarlet side of Strat as a tank</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this weapon is a good mt weapon but I know that main tanks like their faster weapon speeds adn quel'serrar beats this out anyday. Also the bloodlords defender is awesome for tanking i know 4 warriors in my guild have it. I want this for my rogue once we reach bwl for sure.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was feeling like haing to write this after reading the post above.. tanks need 2-3 bags of equipment to switch items depending on boss. No tank can think about tanking from 5 man instances to nefarian with a single set of items, you need to switch basing on the mob you are gonna face.<br /><br />fast weapons are really good to get a fast aggro when you start the encounter, but usually this is just a minor problem. except for fights like Vael, usually you have problems with rage (speaking about people with full epic gear) to spam sunder AND HS all the time, but also usually &quot;sunder sunder sunder..&quot; is enough.<br /><br />IMO this weapon gives a good amount of stats for fights like Broodlord, where you need:<br />- stamina<br />- armor<br />- defence<br />- (dps)<br />why you need dps? cause if you are using more than a single tank, the offtanks could have problems to get rage to spam sunders for the whole duration. (if offtanks have the proper position, they get really few damage, so a good portion of the rage used is gained from damage done).<br /><br />ofc this weapon is not the solution for all the end game encounters, but for melee fights is very good. and trust a tank on this.. weapon speed is important but not in all fights.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just picked this up, so I have yet to do testing, but I know it is going to be better than quel.<br /><br />Weapon speed only matters for ONE fight in endgame tanking. That is Vael. Because that is the only fight that gives you enough rage to throw a HS on every weapon swing.<br /><br />The only reason a fast weapon can ever generate more rage than a slower one with equal dps is because of Unbriddled Wrath.<br /><br />Spineshatter = 54.5+( (9*2)/14 from the str) = 55.8 dps<br />Bloodlord's = 48.2<br /><br />Now, rage generation is damage/(0.5*level). Ignoring atk power bonus from other gear and crit chance (as that will be identical with the two weapons), that leaves us with the following rage/second numbers. Also note that rage generation is purely based on dps, independent of weapon speed.<br /><br />Spineshatter = 55.8/(0.5*60) = 1.86 rage/second<br />Bloodlord's = 48.2/(0.5*60) = 1.61 rage/second<br />Quel'Serrar = 52.5/(0.5*60) = 1.75 rage/second<br /><br />Now, assume the tank has unbriddled wrath. That is 40% chance to get 1 rage on a melee hit.<br /><br />Spineshatter = 1.86 + 0.4/2.6 = 2.01 rage/second<br />Bloodlord's = 1.61 + 0.4/1.9 = 1.82 rage/second<br />Quel'Serrar = 1.75 + 0.4/2 = 1.95 rage/second<br /><br />Now that we have gotten the rage generation straight, lets move on to aggro.<br /><br />Aggro is only dependent on the weapon for Heroic Strike (HS). All other abilites are identical, regardless of weapon.<br /><br />A few philosophical considerations. When using HS as ragedump, it is assumed that the rage cannot be used for anything else that generates aggro. This is based on the fact that HS offers a limited increase in aggro over a sunder and that a HS prevents rage generation from the normal swing it replaces.<br /><br />Add to that the fact that anyone who tanks endgame knows that the amount of situations where you have unlimited rage is very sparse. And in any situation where you do not have more rage than you can dump with HS using a 2.6 weapon, using a 1.9 speed weapon will not help.<br /><br />HS aggro generation is equal to a sunder+the damage caused. So in an ideal situation with unlimited rage the threat difference between the 3 weapons will be the following (ignoring generation from any other abilites as that will be identical, assuming unlimited rage).<br /><br />Spineshatter = 55.8 + (138+260)/2.6 = 208.9 threat/second<br />Bloodlord's = 48.2 + (138+260)/1.9 = 257.7 threat/second<br />Quel'Serrar = 52.5 + (138+260)/2 = 251.5 threat/second<br />Eskhandar's Right Claw = 48 + (138+260)/1.5 = 313.3 threat second<br /><br />These numbers show that in ideal unlimited rage situations, faster weapons are better. The bloodlord's will win over the spineshatter. However, that only happens during the Vael fight, and Eskhandar's Claw smacks anything else in terms of aggro generation on that fight.<br /><br />Now, going back to the rage generation numbers, Spineshatter does generate 10% more rage than Bloodlord's. That roughly translates to 10% more sunders in a fight where rage is limited. Of course incoming damage is the biggest source, but that will be the same for both weapons. On top of that, Spineshatter does 7.6 more dps than Bloodlord's, which adds directly to threat generation.<br /><br />On a tank with defiance and comparing to a rogue with salvation. 7.6 dps more on the tank's weapon will allow the rogue to do 17 dps more before pulling aggro. Now multiply those 15'ish dps with a whole raid worth of dps classes and you get something like +300 raid dps simply from using Spineshatter over Bloodlord's (very rough and inaccurate numbers, but the point is valid). When you do endgame, the aggro limits and raid dps is what matters. And the speed of the weapon has no effect on this at all.<br /><br />The stats are comparable, but in some cases 10 hp and 1 defense does matter. And with the amount of damage coming from non-physical sources in endgame, I would value 10 hp higher than 80 armor.<br />Also, do not forget that 9 str adds 0.45 block value. Not a lot, but it does add up.<br /><br />To sum it up, Spineshatter is the best endgame tanking weapon. Although the differences between the 3 of the &quot;top&quot; ones is not really worth wanting one over the other for, unless you need the stamina increase going from Quel to Spineshatter.<br />Sure, if you suck at tanking and dont know how to manage your rage/mobs, then a faster weapon does make tanking easier. However, if you know what you are doing, the speed of the weapon should make no difference.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this a month back or so. I am a sucker for the respec. I've been all of em so far. I wanted to try mace spec again (which FYI I hated) and was thinking of getting this.<br /><br />It dropped. Warrior priority. Every warrior passed. So it was &quot;open DKP bid&quot;. Everyone again passed. I passed because I was a dagger rogue. Final call was made &quot;Bid now or it's nexus crystals&quot;. I bid base cose, and got it at that. (no-one else wanted it).<br /><br />Now you won't flame me for taking a warrior weapon.<br /><br />1: Mace spec, IMO, blows. When I spec'd it it wasn't really procing reliably or enough. Don't get me wrong sinister striking with this bad boy hurts like hell and my dps was thru the chats, but I found myself wishing I was swords with sword spec.<br /><br />2: Hemo. Oh an this was made for hemo. Slow and high damage. I still haven't decided with hemo if I prefer fast or slow off hand, I was switching between CHT and Sand Polished Hammer. But either way if you're hemo and you don't piss everyone off, this is pretty impressive.<br /><br />All in all this is a really nice weapon for a certain style of rogues, but in BWL tanks make or break the raid. I'd give it to them before taking it. That's me though, you and you're guild do as you please.<br /><br />PS. Viskag is far to rare a drop rate to rely on. The best &quot;alternative&quot; is CTS</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My first BWL run this dropped and none of the other wars wanted to part with their quels.&nbsp; Seeing how I was currently still using a timeworn mace, it was a big upgrade.&nbsp; Not only warriors, but rogues and even pallys passed, and left this to open bid (even druids!)&nbsp; I bid, and won it. <br /><br />Yes it is a bit slow for tanking, yet I am a fury warrior with 10 pts in protection for last resort tanking, this thing is great.&nbsp; Looks however, are so-so. <br /><br />Also for note to Fury/Proc warriors, upon flurried, this weapons attack speed is 2.0.&nbsp; Sweetness.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Too bad that it's so slow, and sucks for rage generation.<br /><br />It's a Shaman stratholme tanking weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>one hell of a good tank weapon bit slow for tanking big mobs but super for bosses<br />it has all what a tank can wish for.<br />+hitpoints + strengt( =+ block) and + defence can never have to muthc of that :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No, they dont need to impliment more beucase paladins simply are not tanks. They are healers and mayb a little bit of DPS, not agro holders. And why would a guild pass a weapon that can be used by a tank in a 40man raid to benefit everyone to someone who will only use it in 5-10 man raids with it being effective. End of Story, not paladin at all</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The slower the weapon, the higher the damage in relation to the dps, and the better the sinister strikes. For a combat rogue, a slow main hand is vital to dps.<br /><br />Noob.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Damage: Good<br />Stats: Good<br />Speed: 2.60 Ouch!<br /><br />Look how slow it is I'm not spending one single dkp point on this. Quel'Serrar or Bloodlord Defender are the best Tanking Weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Seriously, I dont get alot of people. Saying this is a rogue weapon, you first have to understand are you seriously willing to spend the DKP to outbid your Main Tank. If you aren't thinkin of that you obviously aren't in a guild who does DKP and except for a few guilds out there (if not none) if you aren't in a DKP guild you aren't killin no bosses in BWL. Drool more, just don't post the garbage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LOL I love it when people who have no clue try to tell Tanks what they need for tanking.<br /><br />Makes my day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Nice stam buff, strength is good, + def! now we're talking ...uh-oh....2.6? nevermind. I don't understand why Blizz would give tanks such a sweet tanking weapon and then ruin it by making it that slow? Oh, you could probably get away with using it to tank and it would be fantastic to solo with, but when you have to lay in sunders and spam SB/Rev, speed is king.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hi all<br /><br />I have to say,this is a very good tanking weapon, i have it only in my guild. The other tanks have QS, Bloodlord Def. or other.Yeah, it is slow. Then, why can i keep the highest agro whit it? The most of the warriors abilities are instant and i have a lot of block, parry and dodge chance to have more revenge. The heroic strike generates a lot of aggro whit it. It geneerates more rage too whit one strike than QS. I like this weapon, i have it 2 months ago. Who says that is too slow for tanking doesn't know the warrior and never used that mace. And i think, 2 months are enough time to recognize that weapon. And most of our tanks want DE their QS and get this....:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lots of smack talk about the speed, don't get me wrong but TBH I rarely use heroic strike anyways.<br /><br />Sunder -&gt; SB -&gt; Revenge -&gt; repeat with some HS in there when I can...<br /><br />That gets me all the aggro I need, I picked this weapon up for minimum (I wouldn't pay more) and now I have a decent main hand for dual wielding and tanking weapon.<br /><br />A lot better than spending a lot of DKP on a weapon highly desired by rogues and fury warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Aggro difference will be minimal.<br /><br />Only time when i'd use a quel over this would perhaps be on bosses that cant be snap aggrod.<br /><br />On the topic of rage generation:<br /><br />Irrelevant. When you're getting hit for 600+ every hit your rage will generate just fine.<br /><br />As for HS - I rarely use it unless i have the spare rage. I sunder spam and shield block spam to proc a revenge. If i get the spare rage i bat them with a shield slam.<br /><br />A decent weapon for any tank. The quel aint exactly gods gift, it has no solid defense and the stats are weak for what you'd expect off an epic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Honestly, this weapon is slow for a warrior, and lacks stats for a pally...However, the one group that this weapon is feasable for is for feral druids.<br /><br />+defense gear is hard to come by for druids. Outside of the Warden Staff and Unyielding Maul there really aren't many weapons for a feral druid with +defense. This weapon would be a nice one to have for a feral druid. Combine it with a +15 agi enchant and the Tome of Knowledge and you would have some insane stats for tanking.<br /><br />And before you give the arguement that feral druids don't belong in the end-game, we do exist and have our purpose. Personally, I have tanked in MC and AQ. We may not be the powerhouses that warriors are, but with enough agility, our crits help us keep aggro from just about anyone. I rarely lose aggro when I am given a bit to generate some aggro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone know if enchanting this weapon shows the glow of the enchant? Since it has a sort of self-glow on it already...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In the new patch (1.8) all speed of one hand weapons 2.4 all 2handers 3.3 and daggers 1.7 on special moves this has GIMPED all rogues and warriors this game has just become trash 4 melee .They have NERFED rogues and warriors so bad that i will not even play this piece of trash game again unless they fix this situation. ALL MELEE sucks now. Its so sad to see such a great game do something so stupid like this to ruin it 4 all (melee), it was almost unbelievable when i saw what they had done. <br /><br />I have the Empyrean Demolisher it was the best sinister strike weapon on the game other than pvp reward weapons that is, and now has become a P.O.S. Even pvp reward weapons are trash now b/c they are 2 slow between sinister strike half of the beauty was the slow speed bouns, and now the only thing good about them is the high dps. Faster weapons are the best now b/c all weapons are locked on the same speed for the special moves SO GHEY. <br /><br />THERE IS NO DEPTH TO THE GAME ANYMORE <br /><br />So bottom line is we will never hit the high crits and dps like we once did this is such BS. Today was a sad day =*( <br /><br />world of warcraft can kiss my _ _ _ guess its back to DAoC 4 me. <br /><br />When i say no DEPTH i mean on weapon selection. All anyone is going to try 4 now is the fastest weapon they can get their hands on to only come up short of what we once did. B4 if u were another class u would want the fast weapon like a hunter now we will all be going for the fast weapons with the most dps and the slow ones have no use. The slow speed bonus is no more that means no DEPTH and we have been GIMPED. plz dont be a sheep stand up 4 something. We did not deserve a nerf of any sort we already were not the damage dealers (ROGUES) as we were suppose to be as defined in the book. <br /><br />In conclusion BLIZZARD should have fixed the blue weapons that were causing the prob and left the system how it was.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Imo if you have Quel or even B.Defender dont spend dkp on this. At least I wont. Speed kills it :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if all the tanks in the guild have it, Try it on a rogue. Sinisterstrike is like 1.2k in raids :D so not gonna say no to it. got it this week. All our tanks already had it so, lucky me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Spineshatter is the best mace in-game for rogues, excluding honor weapons. You can argue over who should get it, but don't tell me that it's not the best for rogues out there.<br /><br />Assuming that Emp. Demo.'s proc is running 10% of the time (and so procs about one in 20-30 hits), the DPS, <u>including SS and ATP adjustments</u> is equivalent at a bit of <b>2,000</b> ATP.<br /><br />Let's be supergenerous, and assume that the Emp.Demo.'s proc is up 50% of the time (a proc rate of roughly 1 in 6 hits). It still takes 1300 ATP before the Emp beats out Spineshatter.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that 1300 ATP, even buffed, is near impossible while wearing resist gear, and the more realistic 2000 ATP number is definitely impossible.<br /><br />So, basically, don't say there are better rogue maces, because there aren't.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After spending months farming for the Quel`Serrar book I finally gave up. As it turns out, I was fortunate enough to win the Spineshatter tonight. As far as Quel-vs-Spine comparisons...each weapon has its own advantages and both are very nice tanking weapons.<br /><br />The Quel is much faster which will allow warriors to use Heroic Strike during sunder cooldowns to generate large amounts of agro. This is especially useful for certain boss encounters such as Vaelastrasz where rage is unlimited and generating large amounts of agro quickly is key. The proc on the Quel is very nice for tanking as well. The weak top damage of the Quel won't matter as much with the weapon changes in 1.8. But these changes won't effect prot warriors much anyways since their main instant attack (shield slam) isnt affected by weapon dps/speed.<br /><br />The Spineshatter has +5 defense on it. And with the 1.7 defense nerf, warriors are looking to get defense where ever they can. Defense on a weapon is rare enough, so this alone make the Spineshatter appealing. The Spineshatter also has more stamina and +9 strength that the Quel doesn't have. On top of this, the Spineshatter is much easier to get (if your guild can take down raz).<br /><br />Both are very nice weapons for tanking. I'd say the Quel is probably a better tanking weapon for Arms warriors since they lack the defiance talent and need a fast weapon for the added agro of HS spam. But for me I prefer the stats and overall white damage of the Spineshatter. With the recent improvement of Shield Slam, prot wars don't need HS to build tons of agro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm going to pick one of these up asap, i'm a 31/5/15 spec and currently use a Brutality Blade when I have to tank. Slow 1-handers work GREAT when you have mortal strike to throw in here and there, big crits = big threat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hate to break it to ya, but Paladins are efficient tanks. Have you seen the BC spells/talents for Paladins? I've already taken and a look and built a Protection Spec and a Paladin has BETTER snap aggro than a Warrior. In 40m raids above MC, Paladins often tank trash mobs because they put deep DoTs that stack on the tanks and a Paladin could just bubble out of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Actually it's too fast. Empyrean Demolisher has a better proc and is slower. This is for warriors.<br />I'am a rogue with Empyrean Demolisher and a offhand mace and mace-specced. And i would not give a lot DKPs for it. (If nobody wants it... i'll spend some ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't care what class it was made for, real tanks don't need this. Look at how many weapon choices you have as a warrior.<br /><br />It dropped tonight and when it came down to it none of the warriors wanted it. So I now have it on my rogue. =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>agreed with the last dude who posted, doesnt matter whit what u tank, ive even used frostbite for a while wich is a 2.7 weapon, but that depens on what style u use, if ure a hs tank thn weapon speed is vital if ure a sunder, sb/revenge tank (like me) weapon speed doesnt matter, and for tanking in end game stuff speed weapons dont even matter anymore for rage generation since u get hit hard enough and most of ure rage comes from dmg taken</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Pic plz really want that 4 my warrior well only 40 more levels and alot of luck i guess</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sorry to tell u that u are wrong u only need 620 attack power on the empyrean demolisher b/c of the speed (2.8) and it hits as hard top end as the spinshatter not to mention that the low end would be much higher on the empyrean. Even at 500 attack power the min crit is higher on empyrean by 5 damage and the max crit is 4 damage higher on the spineshatter so at 500 Attack power they average out that the empyrean is better on sinister strike b/c of the speed. Oh, u dont believe me well why dont u go to <a href="http://www.geekboys.org/wow/damage" rel="nofollow">http://www.geekboys.org/wow/damage</a> and now lets look at the procs when the empyrean procs it does much much more damage and will proc your other weapon more often b/c of the speed increase plus if u are mace spec it will proc your stuns more, but spineshatter mace has very nice stats and they are always their 4 u so u dont have to take a chance on luck. Bottom line is that empyrean is prob better 4 rogues b/c of duel weapons and the slow speed (2.8) for sinister strike, and the spineshatter is prob better 4 a warrior. Dont get me wrong if i had one or the other i would be very happy.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Aug 23 11:23:05 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is an amazing weapon for almost any class that can hold it. I'm a combat rogue w/o a &quot;specialization&quot; due to my current weapons. I tried Mace Specialization and in PvP it got me killed more quickly then you could say &quot;fart&quot; because the target became immune. It is purely amazing Sinister strike weapon. To the people that say &quot;get an Emp Dem,&quot; some of us don't have the luxuery of killing kazzak weekly because i'm on a PvP server so this is the next best thing. Also, as of later the guilds i've seen are allowing almost anyone to Bid or Roll on anything that is an upgrade because the goal of the game to most is to own hard in PvP and Tada Sinister strike crits for 1k+ w/ this... yeah. <br /><br />&quot;OK! H/o NOW!..... MY MAIN IS A LVL 60 ROGUE!.... main hand weapon<br />..... thats supposed to be a dagger... and no agi... hmmm ..... this sucks for rogue and if your mace spec then god have mercy&quot;<br />^^-- if this guy was in my guild i'd have him kicked rather quickly for idiocy. There is a &quot;combat&quot; tree for something... there is &quot;mace specilization&quot; for something... there is such thing as AP rogues instead of Agi rogues. Less dodge, less overpowered by warriors. GG</div>
