<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I talked Umber first, then goto talk with Rabine Saturna.&nbsp; Later after I back to Umber he gave me 3000 xp but I still have this goo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am pretty sure it is too teach rogues (like me) a lesson for trying to stealth/vanish their way through quests. It fooled me, had to go back and do it properly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well funny thing is when you get the quest to go stir up the beehive the quest giver says bring back something, i don't remember, and also bring back &quot;anything else interesting&quot; that you find.&nbsp; I'd say the goo is &quot;anything else&quot; that's he's looking for but it looks like it's a broke quest.&nbsp; Although I did finish the rest of the original quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think you need to loot the goo, and in order for the object you need to drop from one of the spawns you need to be holding said goo. afterward its useless</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had the encrusted thing drop FIRST, THEN I looted the goo from the hive. Umber gives you the 3000xp after talking to Rabine Saturna and that XP reward has nothing to do with the goo, it's just free XP.<br /><br />So still the goo is a mystery.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Goo is no longer a mystery! According to a Game Master taking the Goo makes those incsects mobs keep spawning at the tower thus allowing you to get the real quest item!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After you go to the Moonglade to turn in the Encrusted Object with Umber, he sends you to talk to Rabine Saturna. Once you turn that portion of the quest, return to Umber, you can then complete a quest from him. The goo does &lt;not&gt; leave your inventory, but you must have it to complete the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes as they say, after you talk to Rabine Satura, go back to Umber again. You'll see a &quot;!&quot; on his head.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I too thought the bugs would just keep coming, but then it hit me! You need to kill them both within 3-5 secs of each other. I droped 1 low enuf that I could just moonfire it, then did the same with the other. They stoped spawning. Either this was what stoped it or i just killed so many that they stoped. Either way, not infinite. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the quest item with out the goo than I took the goo, it didn't do anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Read the quest, the goo has a purpose...you need to &quot;stir&quot; the silithid hive in order to get the mobs to spawn, the mobs are what drop the quest item that you need to turn in.&nbsp; You get the mobs to spawn by opening the hive and looting the goo, that is all it is for.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stir the hive, get the drop. No spawns at the top when we got there, until we stirred it.<br /><br />BTW, they started spawning so fast we couldnt kill them quick enough and had to run for it before it got too far out of hand, 60 BM hunter w/Blastershot Launcher and 60 holy priest.<br /><br />In moonglade, umber says come back, so you have to wait to complete the quest. How long? Doesn't matter, blizz gives us something to do that takes long enough while we wait. I wonder how many dont go back and get their exp/gold...<br /><br />On a side note, Silithus to Moonglade to Silithus is boring crap. Good thing we can fly through now, and leave the PC for the flight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After searching this site, several others, and looking for a reason in-game, I've come to the conclusion that this item is completely and totally useless to all who aren't doing the Hive in the Tower quest. It's sole purpose seems to be a trigger for the bugs to come out after you open the pod at the top. Other than that, there doesn't appear to be a use.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>58 resto druid here - i could stay and kill these guys forever... i finally stopped 22 kills. =D. Was considering being in combat all the way from 58 to 60 =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This along with Bone dust for Marauders of Darrowshire are classified as &quot;quest items&quot; solely because you can only get it if you are on the quest. But that doesn't mean that it is needed in any quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;According to a Game Master taking the Goo makes those incsects mobs keep spawning at the tower thus allowing you to get the real quest item!&quot;<br /><br />- In that case the GM needs to look for a new career.&nbsp; My hunter went up there and never managed to quite reach the top of the tower thanks to constantly spawning mobs.&nbsp; After killing about 10, I gave up trying to get to the top.&nbsp; Nevertheless I DID get the quest drop from one of those insects and NO I NEVER LOOTED THE GOO with that character.<br /><br />&quot;I too thought the bugs would just keep coming, but then it hit me! You need to kill them both within 3-5 secs of each other.&quot;<br /><br />- I'm pretty sure I did this with my rogue on the very first two that spawned, using that ability that lets me hit both at once.&nbsp; However that did not prevent the next 2 from spawning, or the next 2, or the next 2, which finally killed me because I had already used vanish upon looting the BS goo quest item, only to discover it wasn't actually a quest item.<br /><br />This quest is a good concept but needs the bugs taken out.&nbsp; Pun intended.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did get spawns on the way up. Yet they didn't drop anything and no others spawned. Once I picked up the goo they started spawning, and spawning...and spawning...<br /><br />I ran out of mana after 7 (as a mage, 7 is pretty impressive...) and simply gave up. I did make a final attempt and shift-looted 1 corpse, which had the item on it. Easy, but annoying.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I wrote a letter to a GM asking wat to do with it. The reply was basically that the item must be looted for the mobs to spawn at the top of the tower. It was thrown in there to make the quest interesting by providing a infinite flow of mobs. Anyone who says otherwise, you are saying a GM is wrong and his information is false...which last time i checked, was a pretty stupid thing to do. Anyway, once u have handed in the quest, it becomes junk. Im not entirely sure if you need it after the main quest line for the extra 3000xp from Umber, but yeah. Ask a GM about that if u must know, or just keep it until u hand in the quest just to be on the safe side.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok calling each other idiots and such gets you no where. The goo is useless. you dont need to turn it in but you do have to pick it up to spawn the silithid ambushers at the top. these one look like wasps. BUT!... at the bottom of the tower as soon as you walk in it spawns 4 of the angered silithid bugs that spawn when you kill the druids and sentinals... thats probably what you are thinking of when you said that you got the spawns before you got to the top. and if you spend enough time at the top they will spawn again when you come down.So... grab the goo... kill a few...grab the object... jump off the tower... and turn it in got 3300 exp for the first turn in in silithis 8000 for the for the one in moonglade and another 3000 for the second in moonglade :) easy as pie... then just throw away the gooo...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Note that if you want to kill the insects, you need to kill them at roughly the same time. No respawning after that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i did this at lvl 65 and there is NOT a unlimited respawn cos i didn�t know about this till i wondered about what the goo was for and checked thottbot so i kept killing them till they stopped spawning..so there IS a limit of about 16-20 spawns (i guess cos i didnt count them anyway) and i got 2x goo witch i have no idea why well except cos i looted the hive twice... and btw goo is not needed to get the real quest item cos i was a little too fast to go in stealth when opening the hive so i didnt get the goo till i killed like 5 of them and though it was over and looted hive once more and by then i already had gotten the drop from one of the mobs...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So I did it, got the exp and the now worthless goo.. or is it?<br />Is this quest repeatable?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Still got the 3k xp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i bet u they just mislabeled it as a quest item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the actual quest item comes from one of the silithid that pops up after you grab it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yep I too was also fool by the yukky goo when I realised that I had to go back and kill three wasp (where is the fly spray when you need it!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this is useless junk taking up valuable bank space?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>supposedly you can give it to the archivist, Umber, after talking to Rabine for the last time, but other people when they talk to Umber just get a &quot;thankyou&quot; and 3Kxp, and still have goo. Bugged?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The item could have been by a mistake made a Quest Item. Or we don't know it's purpose cause it's secret and no one have discovered what it is used for yet, I smell Artifact or Legendary quest reward. :&gt;<br /><br />On the other hand it's a Quest Item and it is untradeable. ;) Mabye so we can't sell this fun item on the Auction House like we can do with (I want one /cry)..<br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 17th 2006 at 7:04pm EDT by WoWNorwayRinor</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, I think its probably for a future quest too. But luckily I checked my quest log when I picked it up and realized it wasnt the item needed. A fellow guildie wasn't so lucky, she had to go all the way back because she didn't realize.<br /><br />Whether they mean it to or not, it is certainly working like a decoy right now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>anyone knows what its used for ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You loot it from the pod to summon the silthid things that drop the slime crusted thing you need to use to finish the quest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's icky. Ewwww...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just spoke to Apatep (GM) on the Eldre'Thalas server and it seems they are as confused as us lol<br /><br />The response was that if you pick this up from the top of the tower - that is what helps spawn more of the bugs. But they are sure that you need to pick this up as well as the casing that the bug drops. But there is nowhere to turn it in.<br /><br />Basically the goo is there to attract more bugs to you to make it a little more challening.<br /><br />Hope this helps...both Apatep and I are confused about the reasoning to this lol<br /><br />Wildwitch<br />Eldre'Thalas</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's for a future quest i think. they haven't done all the quests for the area. They have plans they just forget parts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can't recall the exact phrasing, but he tells you to find a way to disrupt the hive. You accomplish that by looting the goo. That's my take.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is marked as a quest item because it is required to complete the quest. Without looting the pod and getting this goo, you cannot get the ending item to complete the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>is looted from the pod in the tower that spawns the mobs which drop &quot;Encrusted Silithid Object&quot; that is required to complete the &quot;Hive in the tower&quot; quest...<br />Once you return to Umber to complete Hive in the tower, he sends you to see Rubine, and once that is done, if you return to Umber again, he will have a quest ! overhead &quot;IF&quot; you have this &quot;Silithid Goo&quot; with you.<br /><br />50 cc rep and some exp/loose change if I recall</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Coldbear</b></h3>DELETE after getting the quest object from the ambushers that spawn as soon as you open the pod at the top of the tower. Afaik.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>oozie</b></h3>TL:DR - Delete it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Blitzar</b></h3>So, after you complete the whole quest line and still have the goo in your inventory, would running up the tower while someone else is there spawn the bugs?</div>
