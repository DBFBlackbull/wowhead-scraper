And that without the use of special charms or potions for underwater breathing.\n\nContrary to a post above about the area, the boxes are actually quite easy to spot with a trained eye, and most times I was able to spot 2 or 3 at a time. The trick is to tread water just below the surface, look down and scan the area for boxes, then when a box or 3 is spotted, pop up to the surface for air, dive down, open the box(es), return to the surface for air again, rinse and repeat as required. Just be mindful of the Naga in the area, which for higher levels are simply a nuisance, but could cause some upset for under 35's.\n\nAlso both Waterlogged and Mossy boxes were reported in this area. I don't know if anything has changed in the past month, or my luck is just bad, but I have yet to come across a single Mossy box, and I have scoured Sar'theris Strand and the surrounding area quite thoroughly specifically looking for them. Perhaps others will have more luck.","date":"2007-04-28T11:42:39-05:00","rating":22,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"eccles1975","importedSubject":"Lockpicking Fun"},{"commentv2":1,"number":20,"id":3057198,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"The tower in the bottom right hand corner of Westfall were you do the rogue quest earlier on.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just tested the theory of the SM Doors...<br /><br /><b>open the door, then open a locked box, then open the door again...repeat.</b> <br /><br />It worked but <u>NOT</u> every time. It was cool when it did work.<br /><br />I wanted to mention another way I found that works, again NOT every time, but it works. (for those that can stealth...heehee)<br /><br />Open a door, then open the other door...then make a 'rotation' around the first little area and pickpocket those that are standing there. 1 against the left wall, the 2 in the middle talking, the other guy on the right wall...every once and a while the 2 guys will walk down the halls...do it to them too. Then go pick the doors again. It worked for me 3 times in a row and took like 2 minutes. Thats up 6 points in 2 minutes. Now by doing this, you may even get some lockboxes to open and test the other theory out too. <br /><br /><i>**NOTE--I know you can only pickpocket the guards once in a certain time, but it's the &quot;action&quot; of you doing it that seems to reset the doors...even though you are not getting anything in the process.</i><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First up, if you want Sturdy or Heavy Junkboxes and you're around level 50+, try picking the pockets of the male mobs on the shores of Azshara; I picked up 20 Sturdy's and 5 Heavies in the space of a few hours of Naga-killing fun.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm sure most seasoned rogues would agree that being level 51.8 and having an LP skill of 160 is pretty slack...so I took the SI:7 serving suggestion and headed to Sar'theris Strand in Desolace. Even just swimming around near the shore (36,22 and thereabouts) I managed to average 1 LP skill point every 1.5 minutes. And that without the use of special charms or potions for underwater breathing.<br /><br />Contrary to a post above about the area, the boxes are actually quite easy to spot with a trained eye, and most times I was able to spot 2 or 3 at a time. The trick is to tread water just below the surface, look down and scan the area for boxes, then when a box or 3 is spotted, pop up to the surface for air, dive down, open the box(es), return to the surface for air again, rinse and repeat as required. Just be mindful of the Naga in the area, which for higher levels are simply a nuisance, but could cause some upset for under 35's.<br /><br />Also both Waterlogged and Mossy boxes were reported in this area. I don't know if anything has changed in the past month, or my luck is just bad, but I have yet to come across a single Mossy box, and I have scoured Sar'theris Strand and the surrounding area quite thoroughly specifically looking for them. Perhaps others will have more luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TerribleAtGames</b></h3>This item is neither sellable to vendors or AH. Do not know if tradeable or if they simply have to be destroyed in other to get rid of them for us with class/spec which can't open these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ulrikekekeka</b></h3>Lockboxes and chests can be opened by rogues using the <a href="/classic/spell=1804/pick-lock">Pick Lock</a> skill learned at level 16. Your max level lockpicking skill is determined by the level of your character. The basic formula is 'char level x 5'. So, a level 16 rogue will have a max lockpicking level of 80, a 17 rogue would be 85 and so on up to a (currently) maximum of 300. <br /><br />Once you have learned the lockpicking skill, you will also need a set of <a href="/classic/item=5060/thieves-tools">Thieves' Tools</a>. You do not need to buy these, you should receive them during the 'lockpicking' quest.<br />Once the quest is completed, you can place the <a href="/classic/spell=1804/pick-lock">Pick Lock</a> onto your toolbar from inside your spellbook. You then click this button and then click the lockbox/chest you wish to open.<br />As with most levelling professions, the items you want to unlock will be colour coded with the relevant chance of gaining a level point:- The word 'locked' will be red, orange, yellow, green or grey.<br /><br />Red = Skill level too low<br />Orange = 100% chance of gaining a skill point<br />Yellow = Good chance of gaining a skill point<br />Green = A slight chance of gaining a skill point<br />Grey = No chance of gaining a skill point<br /><br />Lockboxes can also be opened by using a skeleton key created by blacksmiths. These are NOT to be confused with the <a href="/classic/item=13704/skeleton-key">Skeleton Key</a> which is used to open the entrance to the Scholomance instance.<br /><br />The table below shows the minimum lockpicking skill level required to open each type of lockbox and which blacksmith skeleton key will open it (if possible). <br /><br /><table><br /><tr><br /><td><b>Type of Lock/junk box</b></td><br /><td><b>Lockpicking skill required</b></td><br /><td><b>Blacksmithing key required</b></td><br /></tr><br /><br /><tr><br /><td><ul><li><a href="/classic/item=4632/ornate-bronze-lockbox">Ornate Bronze Lockbox</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=16882/battered-junkbox">Battered Junkbox</a></li></ul></td><br /><td>1</td><br /><td><a href="/classic/item=15869/silver-skeleton-key">Silver Skeleton Key</a></td><br /></tr><br /><br /><tr><br /><td><ul><li><a href="/classic/item=4633/heavy-bronze-lockbox">Heavy Bronze Lockbox</a></li></ul></td><br /><td>25</td><br /><td><a href="/classic/item=15869/silver-skeleton-key">Silver Skeleton Key</a></td><br /></tr><br /><br /><tr><br /><td><ul><li><a href="/classic/item=4634/iron-lockbox">Iron Lockbox</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=6355/sturdy-locked-chest">Sturdy Locked Chest</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=16883/worn-junkbox">Worn Junkbox</a></li></ul></td><br /><td>70</td><br /><td><a href="/classic/item=15870/golden-skeleton-key">Golden Skeleton Key</a></td><br /></tr><br /><br /><tr><br /><td><ul><li><a href="/classic/item=4636/strong-iron-lockbox">Strong Iron Lockbox</a></li></ul></td><br /><td>125</td><br /><td><a href="/classic/item=15870/golden-skeleton-key">Golden Skeleton Key</a></td><br /></tr><br /><br /><tr><br /><td><ul><li><a href="/classic/item=4637/steel-lockbox">Steel Lockbox</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=13875/ironbound-locked-chest">Ironbound Locked Chest</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=16884/sturdy-junkbox">Sturdy Junkbox</a></li></ul></td><br /><td>175</td><br /><td><a href="/classic/item=15871/truesilver-skeleton-key">Truesilver Skeleton Key</a></td><br /></tr><br /><br /><tr><br /><td><ul><li><a href="/classic/item=4638/reinforced-steel-lockbox">Reinforced Steel Lockbox</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=5758/mithril-lockbox">Mithril Lockbox</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=5759/thorium-lockbox">Thorium Lockbox</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=5760/eternium-lockbox">Eternium Lockbox</a></li></ul></td><br /><td>225</td><br /><td><a href="/classic/item=15872/arcanite-skeleton-key">Arcanite Skeleton Key</a></td><br /></tr><br /><br /><tr><br /><td><ul><li><a href="/classic/item=13918/reinforced-locked-chest">Reinforced Locked Chest</a></li><li><a href="/classic/item=16885/heavy-junkbox">Heavy Junkbox</a></li></ul></td><br /><td>250</td><br /><td><a href="/classic/item=15872/arcanite-skeleton-key">Arcanite Skeleton Key</a></td><br /></tr><br /></table></div>
