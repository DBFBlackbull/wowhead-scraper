The other hunters left after that. Then i went to Jintha'Alor to charge the Mallet. I used the run, die and ressurect a little further bit technique.

Same as Cutty: Stealthed in, waited for caster to path away, sapped the warrior (twice, distract was resisted the 1st time but he never turned around anyway-I was a little surprised sap worked on him at 5 levels above me), the hard part for me was the 51 elite wolf in front of the altar who has a really short path. He was growling at me from quite a distance. But if you approach the altar from the cave side and wait till the wolf paths away you can do it and vanish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK.... The Sacred Mallet is obtained from a lvl 50 elite troll at the top of Altar of Zul, due West of Jinth'a Alor.&nbsp; There are a pair of these elites, one of which heals the other - best done with someone else.....<br /><br />You then take the mallet up the winding stairs of Jinth'a Alor to the altar there - whole place is packed with lvl 46 - 50 elites, so either go mob-handed or be prepared to stealth in some way, be it invisibility potions etc.<br /><br />The bottom third is the tightest to get past mobs, it opens out a bit after that.....<br /><br />There is no quest associated - just use the mallet at the altar and hey presto, you have the Mallet of Zul'Farrak, for use in the instance of that name outside Gadgetzan - it opens up access to a main boss there.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the correct coordinates once you get the mallet in order to make it into the mallet of zul'farrek are 59,77 that is where the altar is to transform it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those still wondering where the Sacred Mallet drops, it's at the top of the Altar of Zul (<b>coordinates 49, 68</b>). At the top of the altar are usually 3 Soothsayers(regular) and 2 ELITE mobs, one of which drops the mallet. Personally, I think the design team are idiots for putting a mallet for a level 44+ instance on a coupla 50Elites. Your troubles don't end here...once you have the mallet, you have to charge it up at the altar of Jinth Alor which is Elites all around. <br /><br />What is the purpose of this? They shoulda just put the charged mallet on a certain named elite at the Jinth Alor altar since you're going there anyways.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is possible to acquire the Sacred Mallet as a 52 shadow priest (I did it just now). Straightforward enough: make your way up the altar, killing the non-elite trolls. There should be no more than 2-3 on the staircase, and around 2 with the 2 elites at the top.<br /><br />Mind control each non-elite in turn: the focus fire of the other mobs will quickly burn your mind-controlled pet down, then run away until they de-aggro. Once the non-elites are taken care of, de-aggro (i.e. run), come back and mind-control one of the two elites. The one I MC'd had 3 abilities: Shadow Word:Pain, Shadow Bolt and Healing Wave. I shadow bolted the other elite, while keeping SW:P up, until I lost control, at which point both were around half health and close to being out of mana. Crowd control at least one (I used Psychic Scream to fear them both) and kill the other one, and then kill the remaining one.<br /><br />You can just kill Qiaga to get the Sacred Mallet, the other one doesn't drop anything nice, but I did end up killing both.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a lvl50 Frost Mage i solo'd both of these. Was quite tough though, used quite a few cooldowns. <br /><br />Quite a good feeling :) Got the mallet! <br /><br />Will have to do the naked run up to the altar later :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was a 45 Hunter and two other hunters were helpin me too, they were both 45. First we cleared the mobs around Altar of Zul. Then there was only the two elites and two mobs left. We sent in our pets to attack Qiaga. Each of us used a freeze trap on the mobs and the other elite. Then all attacked the 50 elite until she was dead, picked up our Sacred mallets and ran a bit then used Feign Death. The other hunters left after that. Then i went to Jintha'Alor to charge the Mallet. I used the run, die and ressurect a little further bit technique. When i came to the altar there was a lvl 50-52 elite but when she went away a bit i ressurected in a safe spot to get full Health and Mana. Then i waited for the elite to walk away and then i sent in my pet so he took all aggro. Then i just stood right on the altar and clicked on the sacred mallet in my inventory. Then my pet died so i ran to the safe spot and used Feign Death. And then HS'ed out. All this probly took bout 2 hours.<br /><br />Both Altar of Zul and Jintha'Alor can be found in The Hinterlands. <br /><br />Hope this helps some of the fellow hunters :).<br /><br />Good Luck evry1 that is goin to try.<br /><br />IGN: Ogramar<br />Server: Skullcrusher, Alliance</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dont forget the lvl 51 elite wolves that are all over the place<br /><br />bring lots of food and srink on this run<br /><br />solo at 53 pally. just dont agro the hex troll and its not that hard. it was harder getting there than it was actually using the altar.<br /><br />i found it easy so i decided to kill guys for xp.<br /><br />hex troll turned me into frog. hit me with shadow word pain. hit me with his stick. the he rinsed and repeated till i was dead<br /><br />I did get the mallet first though.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Feb 8 07:55:30 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Soloed the quest with 46. Wait until the witch doctor goes into the cavern, then distract the wolf und sap the last remaining guard. Craft your hammer, vanish, finished. pretty easy.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Apr 24th 2007 6:57am by Khorat</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>altar is at 59,77</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a 49 DE priest and i did the same thing you did and it worked. right before i died</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I soloed mist of the with my druid (lvl 47) <br /><br />Well i started out getting the hammer with 2 lvl 50's 1 priest 1 pally then i stealed around the place and died about 3 or 4 times then simply went to alter waited for the patrollers to go away then made mt move by jumoing up the stairs and quickly activateing the hammer. to activate it its about a 3 sec. cast and i had 2 secs to run away. oh if you get the chance wait for some horde to try and kill the mobs. then just tag along. <div class="quote-box"> Nightcrawl on silvermoon realm </div></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It is very odd that for a lvl 50(elite) quest you would need to kill a 53(elite) princess. Then you go to zf and kill a 46(elite) to complete the quest. I would just think it should get harder as you do it, not easier, because making the sacred mallet into the zf one is very hard and almost impossible solo</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What threw me was that I was looking for a clickable altar. You aren't. Go to the center of the ampitheatre and then CLICK THE MALLET - duh. Took me too long to figure that out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>soloed the whole deal as a lvl 55 shaman. pretty easy, just take your time and kill the monsters one at a time. Didn't even die once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After you enter ruins you go all the way up, on the last ledder you will see a cave in front of you, no need to visit a cave, you just go left after you climb ladder and you will come to amphitheatre, in center of it will be altar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Soloed it with my 50 rogue today. Sapped the guard and blinded the hound. Gave me just enough time to make the mallet and vanish to escape alive.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Did the complete Zul Farrak instance last night only to realize at the end that nobody had the hammer. So three of us left the group (46 Mage, 46 Pally and 46 Rogue) to make the trek to hinterlands to grab the mallet. Then made our way to Jintha to try and convert it on the altar there. <br /><br />Here's where the screwy part starts. The mobs there are all 48-49 Elite at the lower lvl part of the temple, then 50 to 51 at the top. We made our way slowly but surely to the altar, grinding through mobs along the way one at time, only to realize there was no way the three of us could take the three 51 elite mobs guarding the altar, not to mention several 50 to 51 elite wolves roaming around.<br /><br />All of that to get a mallet so you can summon a lesser boss? I mean the entire Zul Farrak instance is much easier than Jintha...It just doesn't make any sense. The whole time we're thinking wtf, this is really messed up!<br /><br />So, unless you have a a group of 4-5 very well organized 46-48 toons, forget about it until you get into your 50's, or are a high-lvl rogue and can solo as others mentioned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Totodile</b></h3>Just to confirm the tag on this page, in Classic WoW, the <a href="/classic/item=9241/sacred-mallet">Sacred Mallet</a> drops for everyone in the party.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Acrox123</b></h3>Solo'ed as 48 shadowpriest. Wasnt easy, but doable :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>seraphim1919</b></h3>soloed as a rogue. stealth up to the altar (at the top in the courtyard before the cave with the ancient egg) wait for the lady troll to pat back into the cave. sap the guard, make the mallet, vanish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rsage</b></h3>it's a total headache and probable waste of time, but you can &quot;solo&quot; this as a warrior. i took off all my gear and kept running in and dying. luckily some parts were already cleared but making the mallet was tough. i somehow managed to resurrect in the middle of mobs, put my gear in, charge the guard, fear, and make the mallet before dying.<br /><br />protip: do this quest at the same time as the other elite ones in the area if you're planning to</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>brassy</b></h3>Hey folks - just did this in Phase 2 of Season of Discovery at level 40 with a 15 man raid. We weren't sure if we would all get it, but <b>everyone in the raid was able to loot the mallet</b> when she died. Feel free to bring friends!</div>
