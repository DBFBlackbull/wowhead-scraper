<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone have any ideas why this exists?&nbsp; No sell price, soul-bound, and I can't find anything to craft with it.&nbsp; Don't mind it as an odd drop, it would just be nice if there was a higher purpose =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the purpose of these emblems is a lvl 24 rouge quest for the Ravenholdt Assassin Legue, in the Hillsbrad foothils</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the quest isn't bugged.&nbsp; the chain is just incomplete.&nbsp; So once you raise your rep to friendly, there is nothing you can do until blizzard adds more content.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a troll rogue and just finished this quest. Despite most of them saying &quot;For the Alliance&quot; you can join up. (There is an Orc and a troll in their ranks if you look carefully)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm guessing that there is no longer a quest in Orgrimmar to lead you here, because I have not received one.&nbsp; But I still have 40 emblems in my bank that I suppose I'll be holding until Blizzard implements hero classes.&nbsp; Still a nifty place to go, though, especially for young rogues in Hillsbrad who don't want to fly where ever it is they go to train or buy poison reagents :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>100 rep points per when ya turn em into the gaurds, thats at neutral though so...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Had to turn in 28 Syndicate Emblem for the Ravenholdt Guards to turn from Nutural (yellow) to Friendly (green).&nbsp; So, collect at least 30 Emblems from Syndicates.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So the 300 embalams sitting in my bank are useless?&nbsp; that there is fustrating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was able to turn in a max of 12 to get to friendly as a non-human.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All I did was pickpocket them until I had 30, I went to the person and turned in 10 of them and I was friendly. (I am a human, so i gain reputation faster)<br />Now I have 20 in my bag, and Fahrad will not talk. The Ravenholdt Assassins told me to talk to Winston, but he will not speak at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you only need 12-13 to get frendly with them after that you wont need these any more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>after its done, and u have got the friendly reputation theres nothing to do right? it dosn't lead to any quest or reward?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a human rogue you need 10 of them to get to friendly :) gonna be 12 as a non-human</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They have changed this... used to be +100 rep per turn in, now you get +250 rep for each of these you turn in... so i only needed 12.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This was a pretty easy quest because i have imp sap.<br />All you have to do is sap,pickpocket then move on to the next. Found some good items in their pockets too.</div>
