Requires 4 grave moss and 4 fadeleaf to produce, which makes them quite expencive. However grave moss and fadeleaf can be easaly farmed in Scarlet monsestary (Graveyard and armory), just reset the instance after each run and you can get a full stack of grave moss in 5 runs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>no he only has 1 for everyone. its 30 minutes after that one is purchased, another comes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Correct - Montarr (Lorekeeper) in Thousand Needles (45,51) does have the recipe for Shadow Oil (costs approx. 18s btw)<br /><br />Incorrect - it's not unlimited supply. He only has one so you'll have to wait for 're-spawn' if you come visit and he doesn't have it on him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't think that waiting time is that long. After I saw a Night Elf purchase the Frost oil in Alterac, I only had to wait another half hour to get mine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok so I went to guy in raven hil and only had to wait about 24 mins. which means nothing on spawn times... but anyway<br /><br />yeah 15s &gt; than 5g for this recipe altough on an average server the oil itself sells for 12g a stack which is sweet</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got it from Montarr. He didn't have it when I first got there, so I bought all his scrolls, healing pots, and herbs, basically all his limited supply stuff. Then closed the buy window, reopened, and there was the recipe for shadow oil.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A dog that exists for no other reason then to wander around in circles does NOT sell anything.&nbsp; What were you thinking?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Me2! i just got mine from a goblin a Raven hill, in duskwood.I had to camp he for a while, buti got it for 15silver :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well i waited at bliztek for only 15-20 mins and the potion came up...so the time is about right just talk to him every few minutes and it will come up soon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks for the tips guys. Got it from Bliztik after 5-10 mins waiting and saved 2g when compared to AH prices.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just got it... took *exactly* 60mins waiting beside him 10:56 to 11:56. you're scared to leave your seat in case some thievin pykie comes along and gets it while youre away getting a coffee!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this from &quot;Montarr&quot; in thousand needles on Detheroc after about 3 minutes of waiting. Lucky me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I bought mine from Bliztek.&nbsp; Waited about 15 mins, there is was.&nbsp; 15 silver I think.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Horde, I got mine up in 1k Needles, Freewind Post, limited supply of 1. It was there upon my arrival, 15silver. I will let you guys know the respawn rate as I am now camping it for my pal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, this aint a big wait, I flew back about 15-20 minutes after I first bought it, it was there once more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hakkar server has about a 1hr turnover on this. I got it 2x and its always there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was able to find it on my first try... i first went the opposite way and talked to that other goblin from booty bay on your way to lakeshire... he had mana and health potions and when i tried to buy from him a second time, he had a holy protection potion recipe. then i realized i was at the wrong goblin, but bliztik had the recipe for 16s or 18s.. not sure, when i went to check the price he did not resell it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I bought the recipe then came back exactly 27 min later and it was already there, which goes with what other people have said (20 min).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've literally sat next to him for 2 hours now. Nothing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone knows how much dmg the shadow bolt does?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got it within 45 min</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bliztik still sells the shadow oil he is located at Raven Hill 18,54 on the 2nd floor of the house by Jitters.<br />I was waiting about 10 min. No Problem.<br />Just went out collecting grave moss and came back.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Horde vendor at Freewind Post, Thousand Needles:<br />I arrived at 6:30 server time, went out, came back and checked at 6:47 and it was there. So it does not respawn on the hour every hour there.<br /><br />Hint: I saw a previous post that mentioned that person getting 2 by clicking it twice, so I bought it, it went gray to show no more available, and then i clicked it again, and it gave me another, so alwasy click it twice to try and get 2.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Doesnt work. It probably spawned right when you bought everything, so it musta been coincidence.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Friend and I both got it after 20 - 30 mins of waiting in Thousand Needles/Freewind Post.<br /><br />We were the only ones there, and kept clicking it to refresh, and it wouldn't show up. Then a guy flew in from the bat and it magically appeared shortly after (probably a coincidence though).<br /><br />Friend managed to only get one, but I was able to get 2 =). So we got 3 recipes in 1 recipe spawn. Keep waiting and it will show up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Actually Bliztik is a goblin and is okeydokey for Horde and Alliance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went and camped Bliztik to find out how long it takes to respawn. First, it seems that the recipe respawns after about 45-55 minutes. I wasn't paying attention too closely because it's late. I'm tired. Leave me alone.<br /><br />Second, Bliztik is allied w/ the Booty Bay faction, so as long as you haven't pissed them off, you can buy from him.<br /><br />And yes, as long as you are willing to wait, you can buy more than one from him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>strange, i camped this recipe with my mage, and noticed that if you do aoe damage around the goblin, &quot;unseen&quot; starts to hit you and kills you</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ffs, I go there 12:50 and run windowed mode and watch supplier. a 25 $%^&amp;*!@ appears and run to vendor.. I didnt have time to kill him. and what time does he do this if not 13:37.. I got wtfpwned . if u read this i just wanna say I gonna corpse camp u 1h 10 min, the time I waited for this recipie!<br />heading to 1k needles until next hour..<br /><br />anyone know the max time for a limited supply-recipie to spawn?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>it takes...<br />i will update</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Either the jerk that came in while I was camping there bought the recipe out from under me, or it honestly took 60 minutes to respawn. that's how long I sat there before I saw it. But it'll respawn! Just have to be patient</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This recipe spawns at midnight, like most potions to the best of my knowledge<br /><br />-Augur</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Which is for Horde and which is Alliance? <br /><br />My guess is Montarr is Horde, and Bliztik is Alliance...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After running around like a chicken in Darkshire, I finally ventured forth and found him in Raven Hill Cemetary.. He is upstairs in the house close to Jitters.. I know it is on the map.. but I didnt pay that close of attention.. DOH! <br /><br />Hope this might help others as well.. still waiting for respawn, will see how it goes...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Actionmon</b></h3>I have purchased the Recipe today. I have waited one full hour until it showed up. Unfortunately I don't know when it was purchased before I did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rhinoliar</b></h3>1 full hour of waiting.</div>
