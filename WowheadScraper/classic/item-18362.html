<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What the above people are saying is just bullcrap, I just did this quest and got tired of all the lies these people are trying to pull on you.<br /><br />1) Get the book, trigger the quest.<br />2) Find the Library, use the Crescent key to open the door.<br />3) Inside there is only friendly npc's, you'll see who to talk to by the dot on the minimap.<br />4) Get the trinket and 7000+ xp.<br /><br />...please don't believe the others, it's all bull!@#$.<br />Please confirm you who have done it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OMG .. so I've been running DM nonstop for this trinket (really uber for MC) doing East boss runs (because it's easy) when after lethendris, someone asks if anyone needs this, and links this book.&nbsp; I say OMG and try looting all the corpses again (This is with guild so they know I need it) and I can't find it.&nbsp; It turns out, it was on the floor. *slaps self*<br />SO make sure you guys look around when you do these instances.&nbsp; It might just be lying around on the floor.<br /><br />BTW.&nbsp; The trinket you get has the same name as all other trinkets. &quot;Royal Seal of Eldre'Thas&quot; But depending on your class, you'll get the one that is specific to you.&nbsp; Holy Bologna gives the priest trinket.&nbsp; The emerald dream is for druids, so on and so forth. Its like the insignia fo the alliance.&nbsp; (that its the same name .. but different for every class)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You have to bring it to the library in west Dire Maul, to enter Library, it's better to enter north first and then go through the door to west, library is right behind the door.<br /><br />P.S. English please, only I can read that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest can be done at 54 with the assistance from a person with the cresent key. I just baught the book on Spinebreaker and did it with a friend. You really dont need more then a Lesser Invisibility potion (But you can use a Invisibility potion if you would like to be safer). Since its such a short distance from the start of the instance past the first mob you only need one potion. <br /><br />The thing you need to look out for is the Dog Patrol, they spot you very easy because of there high stealth detection, I had to die once to learn to watch closer. <br /><br />When you go down the ramp to the left at the very beginning of the instance, try not to get to close to the mob at the bottom, jump off the side to get a little distance and then hug the corner of the next ramp down to the library door. Once you get into the library door you're in the clear. Enjoy you new Trinket when you finish that long run down the hall!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have this book I am a 59 priest and it states when I click on it that I am not eligible, yet this is a priest quest for lvl 54 according to the book</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What does &quot;Holy Bologna&quot; mean actually. &quot;Holy piece of meat&quot;? or is &quot;Holy Bologna&quot; just a alternative for &quot;Holy Sh**&quot; or something?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't know what realms all you people are in, but I've been looking for this book on the Elune AH daily for at least six weeks.&nbsp; Today I finally saw one with a bid of 50g, buyout of 75g.&nbsp; If the drop rate has been seriously adjusted since the last big patch, going there to farm it could take forever so the cost is justified for the seller, and a buyer who really wants this trinket will pay it.&nbsp; There are better priest trinkets out there, but if you're not in a raiding guild you're not going to come by them any easier.</div>
