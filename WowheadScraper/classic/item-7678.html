If Im correct, it's Klaven's Tower for Alliance. This recipe is a must for every rogue so you should do this class quest. I hear you can buy the recipe now if you skipped the quest or lost the recipe but no confirmations.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>entropicdragon</b></h3>This is the old version of the recipe; the current version (see <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18160">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18160</a> ) is bind on pickup.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're wondering where you're recipe went... keep in mind this is cooking, not alchemy. :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you didn't do the quest for it, or chucked the recipe, you can buy it now from the Dwarf vendor in the basement of Ravenholdt Manor.&nbsp; There is an unlimited quantity of these as well.&nbsp; I know this because I bought 4 of them, thinking I could make a profit selling some at the AH.&nbsp; Once I got to the AH, I also discovered that the recipe is BoP =).&nbsp; Bought these on 04/12/05<br /><br />--Quick</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, i remember I used to see this in the AH sometimes, but I think blizz changed it recently.&nbsp; Didn't know there was also a vendor in Ravenholdt, thanks for the info.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can horde buy this recipe somewhere<br /><br />cuz the village u say its just aliance , and i am a rogue of horde that have loose&nbsp; his recipe</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Horde rogues can buy this recipe if they accidentally destroyed/sold the one they got with their Poisons quest reward.&nbsp; Go to Ravenholdt, enter the house, then take the staircase down into the basement.&nbsp; You'll find a vendor there who will sell you the Thistle Tea recipe for a few silver.&nbsp; There's also a specialty engineer vendor there.&nbsp; You do not need much of a reputation... although I doubt&nbsp; you'll be able to buy from the vendor if you haven't finished the repeatable faction/syndicate amulet gathering quest for friendly status.<br /><br />My rogue bought the recipe last night (6/6/05) after traveling to alliance newbie lands to get the cooking skill up quickly (it's hard to find the right mobs needed in Horde territories to advance cooking skill quickly in the early stages with the few recipes that the trainer gives you).&nbsp; Fortunately, you just need 60 or 70 cooking skill before you can make the tea, so the grind isn't too bad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First look at this map of Hillsbrad Foothills, note all the yellow squares top right of the map, that's Ravenholdt:<br /><a href="http://i71.www.wowhead.com/classic/m/s/13121.jpg">http://i71.www.wowhead.com/classic/m/s/13121.jpg</a><br /><br />If for some reason that isn't showing, search here on Thottbot for the quest &quot;The Manor, Ravenholdt&quot;.<br /><br />Now, look over to the east, see Durnholde Keep?&nbsp; Ok, now look NorthEast of that, see the pass going NE ?&nbsp; That's towards the Hinterlands.&nbsp; Now if you go here and look north as you enter the pass you should see a little (about 10x10 yards) graveyard.&nbsp; This is the start of the path up to Ravenholdt.&nbsp; Go up, through the cave, et voila, you should see the Manor.<br /><br />The pass up starts at approx. 83,30 (disclaimer: I'm eyeballing that on my ingame map).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>reading all the posts I figured I'd see what was what for myself.&nbsp; My husband has a 34 rogue and I have a toon that I've made into a cook.&nbsp; I had him go to the Vendor in Ravenholdt and grab the recipe.&nbsp; This recipe *is* soulbound to him upon purchase.&nbsp; for testing purposes, he tried to mail it, tried to AH it...didn't happen.&nbsp; Now, I can't speak for any other server, but that's what happened on this day on Sargeras (pvp).&nbsp; I have not tried to take other classes to purchase.&nbsp; But, when my cook is old enough, I might...just to see *shrug* I always like to test things out for myself...die many honorable deaths this way *grin*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so now i know y swifttissle is so valable<br />i was wondering cuz i sold the requirment for a lot of money =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>first of all to get it you have to get the LVL 24 ROGUE quest from uc or org, it says you have to go to ravenholdt manor, after doing the quest there, (you have to get about 30 of the book thingys) you will become friendly with them , once this happens you go downsairs into the basement of the manor adn talk to the poison vendor , he sells it, it IS BoP</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>WOW several ppl keep asking the same questions over &amp; over and ppl have answered it over &amp; over!<br />Can you say REDUNDANT...READ!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a lvl 40 rogue and the guy in the basement doesn't carry the tea recipe anymore.&nbsp; Does anyone know if the location to purchase has changed?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm on the Horde side so I'll be speaking on behalf of the Horde. Go to the Dornhold keep. collect those patches the humaniods are wearing. If you're a rogue it helps to use pickpocket. btw, this place is also great for lockpicking. anyway...the idea is to collect about 30 patches. Once you've done that head towards Ravenhold manor which is directly north of the keep and slightly west. speak with one of the soldiers and give him the patches. At that time you should be honored. You will then be able to obtain thistle tea recipe in the basement.<br /><br />Yes...this can be used in combat. Yes, this is a very hot selling product for those who have the recipe. The recipe itself from Ravenholt is soulbound. The tea gives energy not mana. It's probably best to just look in AH for it.<br /><br />Please correct me if I'm wrong about this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just been as a 39 pally with 225 cooking, the dwary in the basement did not offer it to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />My rouge friend was there yesterday and it was available, so if a rouge wants thistle tea - THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT THEMSELVES</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to the Vendor in the basmentof the Manor but he didn't have any of these recipes.&nbsp; Is there a limited amount or am I in the wrong place?&nbsp; Anyone else have this problem?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes. The recipe can be bought. By whom? Only rogues. It's BOP. No. You can't trade BOP items. Your paladin/warrior/druid/shaman CAN'T go get it. Why? Rogues only. I don't know how many times it can be said. The vendor ONLY sells this to rogues.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a lvl 30 alliance rogue.&nbsp; I've travelled to ravenholdt, performed the (ravenholdt) quest involving the insignias, gotten myself up to friendly status with Ravenholdt.<br />The dwarf poison vendor in the basement does *not* offer me the thislte tea recipie.<br />What am I doing wrong here?&nbsp; Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>to buy the tea in the basement u need to be freindly...in order to become friendly u need to be a rouge and get the patches from the synidicte...so it is rouge only and BOP...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to buy this as an 18 rogue and I had a 28 rogue with me.&nbsp; This recipe did not even appear in the poison vendor's inventory for me, but my friend had no problem buying it.<br />The recipe was soulbound; he couldn't trade it to me.<br />I don't know if there's a level requirement, or if you just need to have done the first ravenholdt quest.&nbsp; My friend was not friendly with ravenholdt when he bought this recipe (though he was working on it).<br />Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>in the past, prolly before you guys even knew what wow was the recipe was boe, even the one the rogue got on the lvl 15 quest, yep its true, now you need ot have rep with ravenholt to buy the recipe or get it at 15 on the quest, only reason the vender sells it is because at one point you could only get the recipe from the quest so if you tossed it , it was gone :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Looks like it's only rogues that can get it.<br /><br />I just swept my warrior through Durnholdt twice and nary a mark nor insignia fell. Also, not a single kill moved my rep meter with Ravenholdt.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can&nbsp; ally get this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Rogues can get the recipe as a quest reward. <br /><br /><a href="/classic/quest=2478/mission-possible-but-not-probable">Mission: Possible But Not Probable</a> (not a twink)<br />Dark Iron</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the guy Nycithis is talking about is called Smudge Thunderwood but it doesn't sell it yet. He is in the basement of Ravenholdt Manor but whether it was sold out or not available I couldn't tell... I desperatly need the recipe, if anyone can help in finding it other then doing the quest would be very useful</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i also messed up by destroying the recipe but after seeing this is went right to revenholt and found it for 2s</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>60 cooking and level 5 to use. If you get this recipe sit on it... Make stack and sell it to a 60 rogue for 10g. You can buy all the mats on AH for 1-2g, huge profit margins :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This can now be purchased from Smudge Thunderbrew in Ravenholdt Manor... finally.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My understanding is that this was to go in next big patch. I have yet to find it on this guy.<br />Has anyone actually purchased it yet?</div>
