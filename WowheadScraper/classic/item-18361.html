<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When you get to 60, it's all about ranged attack power and crit %.. You're not a tank, you're a ranged DPS machine.. that's your place in raid groups.. This trinket goes towards that.. When you realize that 1 agi = 2 ranged attack, this is like getting a 24 agi trinket.. not too shabby,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a drop from a guy in DM northside. YOu need the key first. Then bring a party with you. Gaurd Mol'dar is his name, found at bottom of ramp just north of instance. HUnter pulls him bakc to party, kill, get items, break party, leave inst, reform with a different party former, let the party former go into inst first, repeat process. Easy, it will take some time, but hey, farming dont get easier. And even if the book doesnt drop, good items always will.</div>

They're obviously here just to troll and get attention.<br /><br />ANY +fire resistance gear is great for molten core. Attack power is very beneficial too. I use this with the Quick Strike Ring and combined they're not too far away from +100 attack power. Add in the Trueshot aura power, aspect of the hawk, and you've got yourself a load of ranged attack power (Most likely very close to 1000 ranged attack power).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sense the new hunter quest in 1.7 and the implimentation of the honor system (I think in 1.6), Hunters have a total of 3 hunter trinkets and two slots to put them in. The hunter honor trinket, Insignia of the Alliance, removes stuns and other nasties and is essential for PvP, while the Devilsaur eye/Devilsaur Tooth, are great for anything, as they greatly increase your damage output.<br /><br />Nowadays, this trinket gets left out in the rain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest can be done at 54 with the assistance from a person with the cresent key. I just baught the book on Spinebreaker and did it with a friend. You really dont need more then a Lesser Invisibility potion (But you can use a Invisibility potion if you would like to be safer). Since its such a short distance from the start of the instance past the first mob you only need one potion. <br /><br />The thing you need to look out for is the Dog Patrol, they spot you very easy because of there high stealth detection, I had to die once to learn to watch closer. <br /><br />When you go down the ramp to the left at the very beginning of the instance, try not to get to close to the mob at the bottom, jump off the side to get a little distance and then hug the corner of the next ramp down to the library door. Once you get into the library door you're in the clear. Enjoy you new Trinket when you finish that long run down the hall!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey guys, i saw this on AH for a little over 100g. Someone else also had one on there for bout 75g.<br />Then i saw one for 5g 50s, 6g buyout.<br />Is that a good price for it? I imagine it is but im not sure, judging my the other prices and the trinket i thought it was so i bought it off the AH, just wondering if i got a good buy :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got it for 26gold, 2 hours later it was for 13g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>all you do is take the book to DM, west entrance, either have some1 with key open door for u or have a rogue pick it (requires 300 lp). Then go down the ramp and it takes u right to the library door, u go in and theres the quest reward dude. U dont have to kill anything or risk getting killed..as long as u have a mount and run thru the entrance mobs(which is very easy to do)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>once you get the book, either through buying it or looting it, you read it and it starts a quest.<br />all you do then is go to feralas, follow the main path east, until you get to dire maul. itll be on your map. you go straight up the path, headed north, which goes upto dire maul. you follow the path straight ahead past a few ogres, and follow it around the giant sized corridor. then you get to a junction, you basically just need to keep going north, you go through a little tunnel and it comes out in a big area. then the northern most part of this is a door into the instance. you need to open this with either a key or your HWL rogue guildie :P,&nbsp; then you go in the instance. when you're in the instance look on your map. you can see two thick lines on the edge of teh main square. the think line on the left indicates where the second door is you need to go through. you need either invisibility potion or stealth or feign death to get past here. the door is the next level down from where you are. again, same key, or 300 lockpicking needed. go throught theres, its a rather long tunnel. follow it to a room, then on the right is the yellow '?'. speak to this person. :)!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ESPECIALLY for a hunter,<br /><br />you need the crescent key of course, but go to north entrance, wait for first pat to move to the right, once the pat moves to the right run down the ramp on the left, hug the left side of ramp, watch out for hyena pat while down there and try to keep your distance from the ogre mob. If you can get your hands on a invis potion it'll help too. If you agro the mob, get to the left wall as quick as you can and FD. Once the mob goes back to their spots after the FD, keeping hugging the wall and get into the library.</div>

Not sure if anyone is really going to buy them for 200 since the drops are kind of easy to get. I would guess 25-50g would be a good price.</div>

My hunter's not 60 yet, but she'll have the devilsaur eye (definitely worth getting) so that's an extra 150 AP (plus 2% hit chance) every 2 minutes for 10 seconds plus a constant 48 AP if I get this book.
