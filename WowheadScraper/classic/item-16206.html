The only way that I make profit is if I have the materials myself, or I make about 2g profit per enchant.&nbsp; \nAlso, on Arthas (Horde side), Icy weapon costs about 50g+.\nEssence of Air: 25g\nEssence of Water: 17g\nIcecap:&nbsp; 50s\nSmall Brilliant Shard x4: 8-16g\n\nAll in all it comes to about 50-60g for an enchant of Icy weapon.&nbsp; No enchanter makes more than a 5g profit on that one.&nbsp; The cost of the arcane crystals needed to transmute truesilver to arcanite also pushes the prices to costs that enchanters can't afford.&nbsp; I'll have to pay about 100g plus tip to whoever makes the rod for me, OR buy all the components and tip the alchemist and then the blacksmith.&nbsp; Not to mention the Large and Small Brilliant shards I need (40g total), Greater eternal essences (30g), Illusion dust (17g), and Golden pearls (20g) that I'll need to farm\/buy before I can make an Runed arcanite rod.&nbsp;
