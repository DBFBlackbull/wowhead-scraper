Each time you kill a whelp, you have a 1\/1000 chance of getting the Tiny Whelpling drop. These events are independent of each other, meaning you have a 1\/1000 chance each time of getting a drop and a 999\/1000 of not getting it each time, but the more times you kill a Whelp, the probability you will obtain a Whelpling over that period increases.\n\nThe probability follows a Binomial distribution, as there are two possible outcomes for each kill; either you get a Tiny Crimson Whelpling or you do not.\nhttp:\/\/cnx.rice.edu\/content\/m11024\/latest\/\n\nThis will give the probability of getting a drop out of x number of trials. Using the binomial formula,\nP(x=k)= ((n!)\/(k!(n-k!)))(p^k)((1-p)^(n-k)),\nwhere P = probability of getting a drop, n = the number of Whelps killed, and k = number of Whelplings dropped.\n\nAssume you kill 500 Whelps. With n=500, k=1 (assuming you're hunting for one whelp), and p=0.001; the formula gives a probability of 0.3035, or 30.35%. To put it simply, if you kill 500 Whelps, over that period you have a 30% chance that you will pick up EXACTLY one Whelpling.&nbsp; With k=2, you get a 7.6% chance of finding EXACTLY two Whelplings over those 500 kills. And unfortunately, with k=0, you get a 60.6% chance of not picking up any Whelplings at all. As k increases, the probability goes down very quickly.

I had previously done this with two alliance characters, so I reckon I know what I am talking about at this stage.\n\nFrom the 5 toons farming I've got 2 whelps. I would guess the average is spot on the predicted level of 1 in every 1000 kills. There are other benefits as well of which I have listed below.\n\nThe benefits from this grind are as follows:\nTiny Crimson Whelping (of course)\n11000 XP per hour non-rested assuming that your levels are broadly similar 26-29\nCash about 85CP on average\nGreen drops (see below)\nMining (tin, copper local - silver , gold in raptor cave)\nHerbs (mostly Kingsblood + Small Flame Sacs)\nLeather (see below)\n\nThe breakdown is as follows:\n\nRed Whelp (level 23) 59 kills\n\nCleaver of strength\nLight Leather 80%\nMedium Leather 20%\n\nRed Whelp (level 24) 56 kills\n\nMoss agate\nBuccaneers Robe of Stamina\nLight Leather 70%\nMedium Leather 30%\n\nCrimson Whelp (level 25) 689 kills\n\nDervish Bracers of Power\nDervish Cape of the Monkey\nSuperior Gloves of Healing\nMoss Agate(3)\nSmouldering Pants (3)\nShimmering Stave of The Wood\nSuperior Cloak of the Owl\nIvycloth Bracers of Fiery Wrath\nIvycloth of Healing\nForest Leather Gloves\nPattern: Heavy Earthen Gloves\nPattern: Reinforced Woollen Shoulders \nHefty Battlehammer of the Monkey\nLarge Fang 2%\nShadowgem\n\nLight Leather 60%\nLight Hide 1%\nMedium Hide 3%\nRed Whelp Scale 5%\nMedium Leather 21%\n\nCrimson Whelp (level 26) 669 kills\n\nLesser Moonstone (3)\nMoss Agate (3)\nShadowgem\nSmouldering Pants(5)\nHeavy Bronze Lockbox\nBarbarian War Axe of the Tiger\nIvycloth Mantle of the Wolf\nSuperior Boots of the Monkey\nSage's Boots of the Falcon\nBattleforge Shoulders\nPolished Zweihanger of the Whale\nHefty Battlehammer of the Monkey\nLambient Scale Girdle\nLarge Fang 2%\n\nLight Leather 51%\nMedium Leather 37%\nRed Whelp Scale 8%\nMedium Hide 2%\nSmall Flame Sac 7%\n\nFlamesnort (level 26) 237 kills\n\nShimmering Robe of the Eagle\nSage's Cloak of the Whale\nPlans: Silvered Bronze Shoulders\nSmall Flame sac 4%\n\nMedium Leather 54%\nHeavy leather 17%\nRed Whelp Scale 21%\nMedium Hide 4%\nHeavy Hide 4%\n\nFlamesnort (level 27) 306 kills\n\nDervish Axe of Stamina\nBattle Knife of Arcane Wrath\nBattle Knife of Stamina\nLesser Moonstone (3)\nElders Cloak of the Owl\nBattleforge Wristguards of the Boar\nBright Robe\nPlans: Silvered Bronze Leggings\nSuperior Bracers of Natures' Wrath\n[b]Tiny Crimson Whelping[\/b]\nLarge Fang 1%\nSmall Flame Sac 4%\n\nMedium Hide 4%\nRed Whelp Scale 20%\nMedium Leather 63%\nHeavy leather 13%\n\nOK, let's look at this in detail then. I've had one drop for an applicable 2016 kills. that rates as being unlucky, but statistically acceptable. \n\nFor leveling purposes I think you should aim on farming from levels 26 to end 29. Non-rested you will average 11k per hour so with partial rest you should be doing about 16k. So we're looking at 9 hours of grinding for nearly 4 levels of experience. 9 hours on a leveling guide would probably get you 10 levels so not so hot.\n\nAssuming you are running the swathe from the Green Belt to Direforge Hill, then we are looking at clocking the Crimson and Flamesnorting whelps only. This will average out at 700 kills. Monetary wise so about 6 Gold.\n\nYou will probably pick up about 14 green items. Unfortunately the greens are all level 20-23 so&nbsp; will sell badly on the AH and are just worth disenchanting IMHO.\n\nYou will have a 70% chance of farming a whelp which will sell for between 80-120 Gold depending on server and demand. Yes, I know darks sell for 60-70 gold, this is from experience, you should aim for 100 Gold.\n\nIf you have skinning\/leatherworking it will increase these stats by about 100 in each. If you have engineering\/mining there are lodes of tin\/copper and gems from the whelps to make it worth your while.\n\nIf you have alchemy\/herbalism, the oodles of Kingsblood will boost your skills and give you tons of greater healing potions.\n\nI'm pretty gutted I missed out on another whelp I will not be doing this again. I definitely would have kept it. As the third toon had leatherworking\/skinning however it was well worthwhile.\n\nI am giving this a recommendation as an excellent farming area as long as you keep within levels. There are great bonuses on professions, and if you are lucky enough to get one - well, that's your decision.\n\nIn this I hope to have been of service to you all.\n\nGood luck and be patient.\n\nWe recommend Mobinfo2 to keep you sane and a good guild to talk to.&nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nIf yuo liked this and want to see more - please vote!\n\nThis has been a Nevermind production EU Hellscream&nbsp; &nbsp;","date":"2006-08-25T09:13:48-05:00","rating":53,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"malbekh","importedSubject":"Farming for Whelps - Final Verdict"},{"commentv2":1,"number":18,"id":2668893,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"This little guy is one of the three factors of literally going insane.\n\nStep one: Be as incredibly unlucky as me(two hours every day here for over a year and two months and have yet to see one drop)\n\nStep two: Listen to Gary Jules - Mad World (Loop it!)\n\nStep three: Start farming for this guy.\n\nThese three simple steps are guaranteed to get you thrown into a mental institute.","date":"2007-04-01T09:13:48-05:00","rating":12,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Guru","importedSubject":"One of the three factors..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":19,"id":2668905,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"hi,\ntoday i started to farm at about 5am with a lvl49 paladin without stops runnin and runnin.. it was soo boring.. imho a good tactic is to run in big circles.. the LOST ones dont give pet so u shouldnt kill them.. they are about in the middle of that area..so if u start at north u kill some crimson then some flamenortin..u move southeast and u start runnin the big \"circle\" while u keep watchin every spawn around u that is not \"lost\".. i killed about 600-700 in 2-3 hours so i think i am \"lucky\" but i am sure i am happy xD\nhope this helps from someone, sry for not being so precise and sry for my english, i just wanna help ,)","date":"2007-04-01T09:13:48-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"athace","importedSubject":"3 hours farmin"},{"commentv2":1,"number":20,"id":3028856,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"OK im offically ticked Ive been hunting these things sence L24......Im now halfway to level 30 and Still no tiny crimson welpling.....

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7968</b></h3>Tiny Crimson Whelplings have been farmed ALOT in the past. Most often by new &quot;grinders&quot; due to the fact they sell for a pretty penny on the AH. Although as many have found, this is not the best way to make quick money.</div>

I got my red one after just 30 min grinding (yes I know its random) and used it directly, didnt regret a thing.<br /><br />Everyone should own their own Eyonix that can fly beside you and tell you all the nerfs you will suffer.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lvl 35 combat rogue:<br /><br />i started farming red whelps (NOT lost whelps- they dont drop) at about 2;00am, in the server Malygos.&nbsp; I continued to farm the little guys till 4;00am, killing exactly 140.&nbsp; Defeated i went in for the night, but set my alarm early to 9;00am to start a new day.&nbsp; I started farming em again, and this time no annoying lv 37 druids were there to 'steal' them from me- if i ever find you..., and i got one on lucky number 148! so 8 kills after my log in! i screamed to my guild and theyre all like WTF, but when i explained the % drop they were all happy for me ^_^ (mpst of them didnt even know what it was!).&nbsp; I was debating on selling it in the AH for 100g (as ive seen others posted) but decided ill just farm for Gold on raptors in STV like ive always done to get my mount.<br /><br />Happy Hunting All! - Patients!<br /><br />oh btw, here is a great explination from a previous post, i thought id past it in (gets rid of the %drop confusion- math majors rule ^_^)<br /><br /> ^&nbsp; ^&nbsp; ^&nbsp; ^&nbsp; ^&nbsp; ^&nbsp; &nbsp; ^&nbsp; &nbsp; ^&nbsp; ^&nbsp; ^ <br />I decided to post this message after seeing all the negative resposnses to Flameboy's post up earlier in the thread; he is absolutely correct, and here is the reason behind it all:<br /><br />The probability of an individual drop is 0.1%, or 0.001. Each time you kill a whelp, you have a 1/1000 chance of getting the Tiny Whelpling drop. These events are independent of each other, meaning you have a 1/1000 chance each time of getting a drop and a 999/1000 of not getting it each time, but the more times you kill a Whelp, the probability you will obtain a Whelpling over that period increases.<br /><br />The probability follows a Binomial distribution, as there are two possible outcomes for each kill; either you get a Tiny Crimson Whelpling or you do not.<br /><a href="http://cnx.rice.edu/content/m11024/latest/" rel="nofollow">http://cnx.rice.edu/content/m11024/latest/</a><br /><br />This will give the probability of getting a drop out of x number of trials. Using the binomial formula,<br />P(x=k)= ((n!)/(k!(n-k!)))(p^k)((1-p)^(n-k)),<br />where P = probability of getting a drop, n = the number of Whelps killed, and k = number of Whelplings dropped.<br /><br />Assume you kill 500 Whelps. With n=500, k=1 (assuming you're hunting for one whelp), and p=0.001; the formula gives a probability of 0.3035, or 30.35%. To put it simply, if you kill 500 Whelps, over that period you have a 30% chance that you will pick up EXACTLY one Whelpling.&nbsp; With k=2, you get a 7.6% chance of finding EXACTLY two Whelplings over those 500 kills. And unfortunately, with k=0, you get a 60.6% chance of not picking up any Whelplings at all. As k increases, the probability goes down very quickly. For example, the probability that you would pick up three Whelplings over 500 kills is 0.02%. Also the more Whelps you kill, the higher the probabilities of finding Whelplings, obviously.<br /><br />To sum it up, the probability that you will get at least one Whelping over 500 kills is approximately 39.36% and the probability you will get no Whelplings is 60.64%<br />If you slay 1000 Whelps, you have a 63.23% chance of getting at least one Whelping, and a 36.77% chance of getting none. <br />- -&nbsp; - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - --<br />good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Maybe this will help people who seem to get frustrated.<br /><br />.1% of people will get it their first kill<br />25% of people will get it by their 300th kill<br />63% of people will get it by their 1000th kill<br />86% of people will get it by their 2000th kill<br />99% of people will have it by their 3000th kill<br /><br />BUT THERES STILL THAT 1% OF PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT HAVE AFTER 3000 KILLS!<br />(You will never reach 100% chance, it is technically possible for one to never ever drop, albeit absurdly unlikely)<br /><br />So dont fret the lucky guys who get it within the first 30 min, just be happy your not in that last 1%!<br /><br />And if you get worried that you might be in that last 1%, just remember you have a 1% chance to be that 1% :-p<br /><br />So hopefully now you know exactly how much to worry and when to worry.<br /><br />These stats served me very well, and i have got 3 of these, 2 black 1 green.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've had a dark whelpling for a while now and today (7 april 2006) I got my disgusting oozeling.<br /><br />Tips if you don't wanna be bored while grinding, is to have a good guild with a funny guild chat, makes time fly away, this is what made me forget how boring it was when I was hunting for my dark whelpling :). <br /><br />Another tip is to read a web comic from the beginning to the end while you'grinding. I read pvponline.com while hunting for my oozeling, but you can also check out machall, gucomics, penny-arcade and ctrl-alt-delete. This only works for meele classes like druid, shaman, hunter, warrior and rogue. Maybe warlock can do it to with a little wanding.<br /><br />Podcasts is also nice :) Listening to &quot;The Dawn and Drew show&quot; while grinding Timbermaw rep :)<br /><br />Just shift your attention to something else other than the thing you're killing and it feels that it goes much faster :). <br /><br />Vote for me, cause these tips must be spread to the people :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well here it is, I've been leveling up three toons and all of them have been dispatched off to farm for the Tiny Crimson Whelping. I had previously done this with two alliance characters, so I reckon I know what I am talking about at this stage.<br /><br />From the 5 toons farming I've got 2 whelps. I would guess the average is spot on the predicted level of 1 in every 1000 kills. There are other benefits as well of which I have listed below.<br /><br />The benefits from this grind are as follows:<br />Tiny Crimson Whelping (of course)<br />11000 XP per hour non-rested assuming that your levels are broadly similar 26-29<br />Cash about 85CP on average<br />Green drops (see below)<br />Mining (tin, copper local - silver , gold in raptor cave)<br />Herbs (mostly Kingsblood + Small Flame Sacs)<br />Leather (see below)<br /><br />The breakdown is as follows:<br /><br />Red Whelp (level 23) 59 kills<br /><br />Cleaver of strength<br />Light Leather 80%<br />Medium Leather 20%<br /><br />Red Whelp (level 24) 56 kills<br /><br />Moss agate<br />Buccaneers Robe of Stamina<br />Light Leather 70%<br />Medium Leather 30%<br /><br />Crimson Whelp (level 25) 689 kills<br /><br />Dervish Bracers of Power<br />Dervish Cape of the Monkey<br />Superior Gloves of Healing<br />Moss Agate(3)<br />Smouldering Pants (3)<br />Shimmering Stave of The Wood<br />Superior Cloak of the Owl<br />Ivycloth Bracers of Fiery Wrath<br />Ivycloth of Healing<br />Forest Leather Gloves<br />Pattern: Heavy Earthen Gloves<br />Pattern: Reinforced Woollen Shoulders <br />Hefty Battlehammer of the Monkey<br />Large Fang 2%<br />Shadowgem<br /><br />Light Leather 60%<br />Light Hide 1%<br />Medium Hide 3%<br />Red Whelp Scale 5%<br />Medium Leather 21%<br /><br />Crimson Whelp (level 26) 669 kills<br /><br />Lesser Moonstone (3)<br />Moss Agate (3)<br />Shadowgem<br />Smouldering Pants(5)<br />Heavy Bronze Lockbox<br />Barbarian War Axe of the Tiger<br />Ivycloth Mantle of the Wolf<br />Superior Boots of the Monkey<br />Sage's Boots of the Falcon<br />Battleforge Shoulders<br />Polished Zweihanger of the Whale<br />Hefty Battlehammer of the Monkey<br />Lambient Scale Girdle<br />Large Fang 2%<br /><br />Light Leather 51%<br />Medium Leather 37%<br />Red Whelp Scale 8%<br />Medium Hide 2%<br />Small Flame Sac 7%<br /><br />Flamesnort (level 26) 237 kills<br /><br />Shimmering Robe of the Eagle<br />Sage's Cloak of the Whale<br />Plans: Silvered Bronze Shoulders<br />Small Flame sac 4%<br /><br />Medium Leather 54%<br />Heavy leather 17%<br />Red Whelp Scale 21%<br />Medium Hide 4%<br />Heavy Hide 4%<br /><br />Flamesnort (level 27) 306 kills<br /><br />Dervish Axe of Stamina<br />Battle Knife of Arcane Wrath<br />Battle Knife of Stamina<br />Lesser Moonstone (3)<br />Elders Cloak of the Owl<br />Battleforge Wristguards of the Boar<br />Bright Robe<br />Plans: Silvered Bronze Leggings<br />Superior Bracers of Natures' Wrath<br /><b>Tiny Crimson Whelping</b><br />Large Fang 1%<br />Small Flame Sac 4%<br /><br />Medium Hide 4%<br />Red Whelp Scale 20%<br />Medium Leather 63%<br />Heavy leather 13%<br /><br />OK, let's look at this in detail then. I've had one drop for an applicable 2016 kills. that rates as being unlucky, but statistically acceptable. <br /><br />For leveling purposes I think you should aim on farming from levels 26 to end 29. Non-rested you will average 11k per hour so with partial rest you should be doing about 16k. So we're looking at 9 hours of grinding for nearly 4 levels of experience. 9 hours on a leveling guide would probably get you 10 levels so not so hot.<br /><br />Assuming you are running the swathe from the Green Belt to Direforge Hill, then we are looking at clocking the Crimson and Flamesnorting whelps only. This will average out at 700 kills. Monetary wise so about 6 Gold.<br /><br />You will probably pick up about 14 green items. Unfortunately the greens are all level 20-23 so&nbsp; will sell badly on the AH and are just worth disenchanting IMHO.<br /><br />You will have a 70% chance of farming a whelp which will sell for between 80-120 Gold depending on server and demand. Yes, I know darks sell for 60-70 gold, this is from experience, you should aim for 100 Gold.<br /><br />If you have skinning/leatherworking it will increase these stats by about 100 in each. If you have engineering/mining there are lodes of tin/copper and gems from the whelps to make it worth your while.<br /><br />If you have alchemy/herbalism, the oodles of Kingsblood will boost your skills and give you tons of greater healing potions.<br /><br />I'm pretty gutted I missed out on another whelp I will not be doing this again. I definitely would have kept it. As the third toon had leatherworking/skinning however it was well worthwhile.<br /><br />I am giving this a recommendation as an excellent farming area as long as you keep within levels. There are great bonuses on professions, and if you are lucky enough to get one - well, that's your decision.<br /><br />In this I hope to have been of service to you all.<br /><br />Good luck and be patient.<br /><br />We recommend Mobinfo2 to keep you sane and a good guild to talk to.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />If yuo liked this and want to see more - please vote!<br /><br />This has been a Nevermind production EU Hellscream&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sheez - My hubby and I aggressively farmed the Crimsons and Flamesnorts in the Wetlands for 6 hours a day for a week and a half before I got one. Took four more days of 6 hours a day to get another. He hasn't gotten a single one. Now I'm too high a level to make xp off of them anymore, so I suppose I'll move on to other locations and let the lowers take over my spot. It's still a good spot to make some money if you make good use of the AH on other drops and it seems to be a good place for herbalists as well.<br /><br />So now that I have a second, I'm torn over whether to help my guild with mount money or keep it for myself . . .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ive been trying to get one of these for days and over the progression of my levels but have had no luck.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First one dropped off a red whelp, after 3 hours of farming. 2nd after about 5 hours off another red whelp. Very monotonous to do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>from 24-32 i farmed these whelps in wetlands, no luck whatsoever. I sorta gave in because i'd heard someone else had got one, so i went for the greens the rest of the day. Now im level 44, went back to start on my enchanting, with in a few kills i got a whelpling. So to not be greedy i went and farmed dark iron dwarves for enchant fodder (materials for those who dont know). On my way back, i say to my roomate, it'd be funny if a dragonling dropped again. I wouldnt go for dragon's call if i got it. Then i said no no i would because i want it.. but still itd be odd. And so a dragonling dropped right after. all within a couple of kills. Generally ive seen level 40's gettin these. But yea, funny story hehe :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been hunting these things for about a week now. I have found 3 so far.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>... Even though it hasn't dropped for me yet! (points to my topic name)<br /><br />Farmed for a day so far, plan on farming on and off for a while. For a while, I thought about just buying one of these things off of the Horde AH for 88g (Bloodhoof, and I had 121g at the time, still do xD), but decided farming for a rare item was just more fun. <br /><br />I chatted with a few friends while I farmed, though luckily there was no one else farming. Just one Night Elf Druid trying to grind/quest... I left him/her alone, to their own intentions. No biggy.<br /><br />Maybe I will have the luck some of you guys have had, eventually =) As for me, back to Wetlands!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, I got one after about 5 hours and killing 300 of the little beasts. I leveled from 32 to 33 also, and made about 20g on the AH from the &quot;regular&quot; drops. (A bunch of greens and one blue weapon, along with tons of red Whelp scale, and light/medium/heavy leather.)<br /><br />The Whelplings seem to sell for about 150G on Garona Alliance AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got two in the same day... the second one was missed by a 60 farming for the same thing I assume. He ran away in pursuit of another Crimson Whelp leaving a level 24 red behind. The first had been caught on the third whelp of the day... So far a luck day for me indeed. Being almost 35 this makes perfect money for a mount and some twinkage for 39 BGs.<br /><br />Oh and for the record 85g is the going rate on Terenas though it does peak to around 100g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this little pet is making me insane! when i was like lvl 35 err so i heard about this little thing, i thought it was great that it sells for so much. i was getting my mount soon so i thought it would be a good idea to sell this thig. so i was farming and after about 5-6 hours nothing showed up..... time to brew some coffee! about 3 hous later i was a little tired and going crazy in the head. this guy shows up ad after three freaking kills hes like &quot;Hey dude guess what...&quot; and links the $%^&amp; right infront of my face! i killed 3500 of these little %^&amp;*!es and he kills three and loots the damn thing...<br /><br />to this day i havent tryed to farm it again....<br />im lvl 41 now and i have my mount, got the money from a uldaman run that droped some blue sword! it payed for the hole mount! and it took me like 1 hour to go thru uldaman! my advice is....dont farm this thing just keep lvling and soon enough u will get lucky like me and get 1 item that pays for it all....thats not stupid little whelp! ..........maybe<br /><br />Mattythekid<br />Shadowsong</div>

Well as long as I know they don't. A guy who has one told me that but there is another cutie who fights for you, an Arcanite Dragonling. It's a trinket made of lvl 300 engineers. People must have got them confused. Not strange, the icon looks the same. So all you guys who like me want one just grab an engineer. :)<br /><br /><a href="/classic/item=16022/arcanite-dragonling">Arcanite Dragonling</a>]Edited, Mar 10th 2007 11:07am by mimmis</div>

I farmed for a week and finally got one. <br /><br />The whole time I farmed I was so sure that I would sell it right away, but when one finally dropped the allure to use it was quite strong!

I completely avoided killing Lost Whelps since they don't drop it. Only time I killed any Lost Whelps was when they agro'd me while trying to kill a red whelp. Took me about 3 hours to farm it out. Right before I got it, I got about 6 green item drops consecutively(not in a row, but damn near). I was just about to give up and was heading for the road. Saw a red whelp and thought, killing this one couldn't hurt. And it dropped :D I was so excited.</div>

Red, Crimson and Flamesnort - that's what people say over and over drop it. Not the Lost Whelplings that range a bit to the north. Don't waste your time on them.<br /><br />I just got to where I can hunt reds, and I plan to do some leveling and skinning skill upping here. My kid really wants one of these.<br /><br />If you have a little money, always check the AH when you pass by. You never know. I saw black whelpling pets for 100 and 105 gold buyout the other night on my server - gah. Hope no one bought em. Sometimes sellers either don't know what things are worth, decide to be generous, or are just desperate for a quick sale. GL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Listen guys, I realized something not too long ago, you get better drop rates in a party! they don't have to be anywhere near you, they ca be doing something on another continent, but the drop rates do increase! I was farming them for the whelpling and Medium hide/leather, with no luck on the pet or hides, but as soon as I joined a party and was waiting for the person to get here, BAM! got 2 medium hides in a row, followed by another a few kills later, a Moss Agate 3 kills later, and after another 8 or so, the whelpling dropped! as the other person was nowhere near me, I got full exp and all the drops, and all the cash, but the drop rate DID increase! try it for yourself and see how well it works!</div>

I think I'll do that again.&quot; So I go back to Wetlands, and start killing whelps again. This time it only takes 30 minutes to get one to drop, and it's currently on the AH house.<br /><br />My question is, am I just defying probability here, or did the drop rate on these change?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After reading the posts about the critter, I decided to try get myself one of them. I was mainly interested in golds that this pet might bring in. After about 2 sessions of farming(about4 hours), tiny crimson whelpling dropped after I killed a flamesnorting dragonkin in the wetlands. I put it on AH at echo isle server for 70g. No taker after my first attempt. While I was trying to decide what to do, my two littleuns saw that I had a new thing on the screen. After hearing what that was, they &quot;insisted&quot; that I keep the pet. So, I kept him. I am glad that I made that decision. It is a very cute pet to have around. And when I have him out, people ask me about him. Golds, I can always farm more. And after all, none of these are &quot;real&quot; anyway so why not have little fun. Well, thats my story.</div>

This is great for people who farm.. It resets the item pops. I've found several of these in this way.. Watch for a reset time, login 5 minutes after it.. and go searching... If your the first person down there.. Odds are your gonna get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>2hrs and 44 mins later I finally got one.... Man I hate farming and I wont be doing this for a while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I spent two days farming them, with no luck. Though I did get a very nice amount of leather/scales/greens, and even a nice blue. <br /><br />Third day comes around. I'm farming once through in the morning, and just as I'm about to stop, one drops. I thought to leave right then, but then noticed a few more crimsons around. Lo and behold, one more came with the last crimson around. <br /><br />Afternoon comes around, and I'm back from classes. I kill 1, and another drops. I swear I /cheer'd about 30 times. &gt;_&gt;;<br /><br />So my advice to you is not to give up. It may seem like you'll never get it, but it WILL drop if you're patient. And of course, taking a break here and there will keep you from going insane.</div>

Hundreds of kills later, no luck whatsover. I wish I could say that if you keep killing, you'll get one. Unfortunately, I can't.

I went form 180 to 220 in skinning while killing, and I have loads of materials for leatherwork.

ALL to no Avail! &gt;&lt; <br /><br />Good thing I'm also making a KILLING from leathers and drops! =) But I can't BELIEVE, and as a Math major, will NOT believe that there is nothing more to it than simply killing dragons.

We've gotten a total of 5 blue drops, but no Whelpling.<br /><br />I'm going to go back at it and just going to take the advice of just not planning on even getting the drop. I'll just let it surprise me. <br /><br />Well good luck to you guys! (Yeah Right, If you've already gotten the drop in 40-50 kills, then your luck is statistically overflowing&quot;)<br /><br /> LONG LIVE NOX NOCTIS!<br /><br /> - /\/ /\/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I saw a dwarf running around and he had an adorable crimson whelpling with him. I asked him where he got it and he took me to the place, I killed about 20-25 whelps, and got one. He an I were both shocked since it's a very rare drop and out of the blue I got one! Good luck guys, never give up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I jsut found 7 of them in 30 minutes of killing. I am so lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Listen guys, I realized something not too long ago, you get better drop rates in a party! they don't have to be anywhere near you, they ca be doing something on another continent, but the drop rates do increase! I was farming them for the whelpling and Medium hide/leather, with no luck on the pet or hides, but as soon as I joined a party and was waiting for the person to get here, BAM! got 2 medium hides in a row, followed by another a few kills later, a Moss Agate 3 kills later, and after another 8 or so, the whelpling dropped! as the other person was nowhere near me, I got full exp and all the drops, and all the cash, but the drop rate DID increase! try it for yourself and see how well it works!</div>

We are both racing to get the next whelp,I get there first so he goes to the one beside it... it drops for him. He was there for 30 min. I was irate and after another two hours I have given up. To anyone that actually got one as a drop rather than buying it on AH, I aplaud you, you lucky lucky people. /cry</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got mine half an hour ago and well pleased with it :-) It's definitely the best pet I've seen in the game, very cute and cool.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was killing these trying to get a moss agate (apparently red and flamesnorting drop them at 0.31%). Got one of these guys after about 50 kills. I used it before realizing how much they sell for (on Lightbringer they can go for up to 90g). I felt stupid for a little while until I took a good look at him and realized how cute he is. Still feel stupid though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got mine today. after 2 hours of fighting those pigs! Got mine from a Crimson Whelp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On kill #51 of Crimson Whelplings, one finally dropped for me. My boyfriend and I were farming them ob Bloodscalp tonight, because he needs mount money, and it dropped for me.<br /><br />He won't let me give it to him, and said that I'll be needing money soon myself. (I have a Coll. Edition Zerling, so likely won't use the Whelpling myself).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>found 2 of them just 50mins of hunting crimson whelp. :D]</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I managed to get two of these little guys. Though, only one is mine, i gave the other away. :D Here's my story...<br /><br />When i was in the lower 30s-40s i had spent quite a bit of time farming one of these to keep. I remember seeing it on TV and i told myself i wanted one. Got the game, got to the level, got the pet. Took me a little while to get it though...10+ hours at least. Funny thing is, it dropped on my final kill for the night, right before i went to bed. <br /><br />Now, probably close to 8 ish months later, i still regularly summon the pet. He's great. I recently found out that a friend of mine played, and, while we were leveling her new characte up she saw my whelp. She decided she really wanted one too. So, i decided it would make the perfect holiday gift. Earlier today, i starting farming the whelps. After i decided i was sick of killing them (about 2 hours later...maybe 100ish kills) i killed one last whelp...and wouldn't you know it, there it was. my second tiny crimson whelpling. <br /><br />Have faith all those who take on the task of farming these guys. It will take a while for a drop to happen, but it will happen. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>swampers</b></h3>1440 kills. Levelled from 24 to 30. It does drop, but oh gods it's still a grind.<br /><br />Happy to have my pet back though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mudplayerx</b></h3>This &quot;Dropped By&quot; list is not accurate. I have personally had the pet drop from the Flamesnorting Whelps as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mudplayerx</b></h3>Before you waste this pet, it's probably better to sell it than use it on a pvp server as a rogue or druid. The pet doesn't stealth with you and is a dead giveaway of where you are located.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HappyHelps</b></h3>For Classic Era 1.15.4 the drop rates from highest to lowest are as follows..<br /><br /><b>1.)</b> <i>Flamingsnorting Whelps</i> <b>0.9%</b><br /><b>2.)</b> <i>Crimson Whelps</i> <b>0.4%</b><br /><b>3.)</b> <i>Red Whelps</i> <b>0.3%</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karmapolice</b></h3>Wanted to share my experience farming for this in WoW Classic Anniversary. <br /><br />It took me about two hours (I think) of farming in the Wetlands and dropped on my 205th kill of Crimson Whelps. I'd also killed 91 Flamesnorting Whelps and 50 Lost Whelps, basically going around in a circle killing whelps over and over. After reading the other comments here I consider that a pretty lucky outcome.<br /><br />I had one of these back in Vanilla but I swear it dropped off a whelp in Swamp of Sorrows which is strange because after some Googling it seems that these only drop in Wetlands but I am 99.99% sure I had a Tiny Crimson Whelpling drop in SoS (or possibly Dustwallow Marsh, I vaguely remember the location having the dingy vibe of those places). I don't know if Blizzard changed which enemies this drops from at some point?<br /><br />Oh, and in that two-hour span I also had around 8-10 greens drop and a blue drop (Starsight Tunic).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ahritales</b></h3>I can confirm they do drop from Flamesnorting Whelps as well. (WoW Classic Era)</div>
