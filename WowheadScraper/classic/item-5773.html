Just walk in, kill the Voidcaller herself and run away from the Voidwalker.&nbsp; This is a bit difficult for the first two Kills, since you have to actually run out of the tower to be \"leaving combat\", but it works. \n\nWhen you get out of combat the Voidwalker will run back to the spot he entered the fight. When he reaches it he simply vanishes because his Voidcallerlady is gone and he melts in depression.\n\nWhen you advance in the tower it gets even easier: Just jump down in the tower. The voidcaller will follow you 1-2 floors then he turns his back. Saves a lot of time and makes you even have some respawn waiting time (for writing texts like this for example)\n\nEdit: And whoever said that the voidcallers drop green stuff: nope, not even one, just wool, silk and cheese.\n\nEdit2, observations: It's 6:00 am now.

Your best bet is to go to the tower of Althaxx in Darkshore, and kill the high lvl enchanters there. The enchanters in Duskwood pop too infrequently, and with too many other NPCs around them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>41674</b></h3>Farmed the recipe from the Voidcallers in the tower of Althaxx in Darkshore, took about 55 kills. So not impossible to get, just time consuming and a long run if your horde.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Biosphere</b></h3>Tried farming this pattern for my upcoming Warlock.<br /><br />After spending a couple hours at the farms in Duskwood, went back the following day and logged in two high level two toons, one in the Tower and one at the farms.<br /><br />I found that clearing Yorgen's Farmstead then riding to Addle's Stead and riding back after clearing that area, I could log in at the Tower to a fresh spawn. After clearing the Tower, log back into Duskwood and Yorgens Farmstead would have respawned. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />After doing this, the pattern eventually dropped after approx 2 hours at Addle's Stead in Duskwood<br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>47393</b></h3>Wasn't that bad actually. I took my main there, took about 6 mobs for it to drop for me. Woot =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Easier to get the scroll off these mobs in my opinion. A lot more to kill in one area and fast repop instead of constantly switching back and forth between camps. Farmed about 5 hours worth of Defias Enchanters compared to 30 minutes of Voidcallers before getting the pattern. Voidcallers were also a better choice considering I was 36 and couldn't stock up on soul shards from the Enchanters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There's a tower towards the northern strip of land, on the south-eastern part of the bend there of the road.<br /><br />Had to kill ~30 of these guys to get it, but it did&nbsp; drop.&nbsp; I would suggest to bring a friend of some type, specially one that can heal some way, these mobs do like to run around a lot and get friends, and even if you're 40+ (like myself), that kind of damage adds up quick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In case it hasn't come to your attention yet, the Robe of Arcana is a prerequisite item in the level 37 Warlock class quest to make the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4101/ripped-note">Enchantes Gold Bloodrobe</a>. You probably can sell a single robe off for at least 5-10g, in particular on the Horde side, as it's not a pattern which drops from mobs that are found in their regular leveling areas and hence are rather rare in their own army of tailors.<br /><br />The pattern itself would probably sell for 20g+ and be one of the more successful items in the neutral AHs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Seriously its insane</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hordes send mail to Phearnoia send the silk and ill make it for you, Undead WL on Frostmane realm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Darkshore tower had a 60 undead mage and a 37 human warlock farming it. Didn't get ganked by the warlock, but the mage said he'd been farming there for three days. I farmed for like, three kills (I'd say about 15 minutes, minus travel), and it dropped. Nice guy that I am, I'm gonna make some for him. I'll make some for you, too, if you've got the mats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>okay, so i went to the darkshore....i didn't even SEE voidcallers or any wizards just some slithery snake water things (yes i forgot their names) and some&nbsp; darkstrand fanatics. i'm on medivh,i need help, i wanna gouge my eyes out but then i won't be able to play anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You will find this.<br /><br />I tried the Yorgen Farmstead and maybe it was just me, but the respawn rate was just too terribly slow. There are only three Enchanters at any one time and they seem to take forever to return.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Tower is sort of the opposite problem.<br /><br />I killed about 150 Voidbringers in the Tower with my 35-36 Mage (she was 35 when I started, but rested experience brought her to 36 by the time I found it), died four times, helped some Alliance folks do their quest there (or could have confounded their ability to do so if I were of a mind to, which I'm not), found zillions of level req. 22-25 green items; nothing fancy-able, but&nbsp; and good disenchanting fodder for my budding Enchantress.<br /><br />Who happens to also need the robe which is selling for the outrageous price of &gt;6 gold at the Scarlet Crusade Horde-side auction house.<br /><br />It was so worth it getting it for myself.<br /><br />People who charge that much for simple items just because they can don't get my money.<br /><br />Just keep trying if you're looking for this. Don't give up. Remember that however long you've been farming, every time you loot you have the same 1% chance. You will eventually roll the right numbers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just a little hint for farming the Voidcallers in the Tower of Althalaxx:<br />Don't kill the Voidwalkers. Just walk in, kill the Voidcaller herself and run away from the Voidwalker.&nbsp; This is a bit difficult for the first two Kills, since you have to actually run out of the tower to be &quot;leaving combat&quot;, but it works. <br /><br />When you get out of combat the Voidwalker will run back to the spot he entered the fight. When he reaches it he simply vanishes because his Voidcallerlady is gone and he melts in depression.<br /><br />When you advance in the tower it gets even easier: Just jump down in the tower. The voidcaller will follow you 1-2 floors then he turns his back. Saves a lot of time and makes you even have some respawn waiting time (for writing texts like this for example)<br /><br />Edit: And whoever said that the voidcallers drop green stuff: nope, not even one, just wool, silk and cheese.<br /><br />Edit2, observations: It's 6:00 am now. I started killing around 3:00. I'm lvl 39 thus having quite a fast killrate for these 28s. But as described above, they dropped nothing of use, only cloth, all the time.<br /><br />Now suddenly, 5 minutes to 6 everything changed. I don't know if blizzard is having a night-farming-block built in their game oder if it's just my slower killspeed (I switched to playing one-handed mouseonly because i rested my head on the other one) but suddenly they started to drop. First a Cavalier two-hander, then healing potions, then Sanguine Armor, Dokebi Cord...it was raining items, every kill a useful drop with 50-70 lootfree kills before.<br /><br />Ah, and of course after 10 hours of combined farming FINALLY my Pattern *happy smiling*<br /><br />So maybe it's true and you should set your alarmclock to 5:50 am to get your pattern or at least don't farm in the night, even if you are a proud member of our horde :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I as a bored lvl 70 mage wanted to test this drop-rate so i decided to spend exactly 1 hour each at these places (ofc the probobility kicks in here so it is just about luck).in the hour spent in ashenvale killing darkstrand voidcallers i got 1 pattern and 1 green item. And after 1 hour in duskwood killing defias enchanters i had 13 patterns and 1 green item....<br />i think that your best bet is duskwood because there is more to kill there and you dont have to wait as long for the mobs to respawn. <br /><br />/****** Daggerspine Eu</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I picked up mine today from the Tower in Darkshore.As a L30 Lock it took about an hour. Failed to take on all 4 casters and their voidies at the top they were beyond my skills (my best was 3 pairs). NOte the pets dont die when their owners do. Tried leading them out one at a time but failed miserably as they were all so close, made quite a few trips to and from the graveyard.<br />They respawn fairly quickly so be prepared for a fight going out as well or if you are slow working your way up they will gank you from behind.They are always on the move and replenish health just when u think its over. If you are squishy clothie like me make sure u have yr healthstone / buffs employed and a few healing potions wont go astray. As you burn up mana so fast here have a few mana potions on hand too.<br />Or you can make life easy bring a friend / guildy.<br />Have to say its quite rewardeing tho if you do it alone.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I ran through this tower as my lvl 60 rogue, thinking it would have been quicker than with one of my lower level alts. The answer is - probably not. When you one shot these guys, there is a lot of downtime before they respawn. There are also only 5 or 6 Dark Strand Voidcallers in there, and they seem to be on a 5 minute timer. I got my pattern to drop on the fifth trip through (about 30 minutes in). It was the only green item that dropped. I also got:<br /> - 35 silver (big deal)<br /> - 18 wool (worth 43s on my AH)<br /> - 10 silk (worth 19s on my AH - please don't ask me why wool is more valuable; I don't get it either)<br /> - a handful of linen that I didn't bother to loot<br /> - 6 gray items for vendor trash, ranging from 5s46g to 34s51s (grand total: about a gold)<br /><br />Grand total: the pattern plus about 1g97s in vendor trash and trade goods.<br /><br />Not the most efficient use of time, but certainly more profitable than spending 15g on it at the auction house.</div>

It's funny, because I just finished silently begging God/the Defias to drop it, and there it was. I'm sorry I don't have a count of how many I killed, but 9 hours...that's a lot of Defias.<br /><br />Btw, I was on my lvl 31-33 (gained 2 lvls farming this) gnome mage.

I tried running back and forth to both farms but after a couple of trips I decided to just hang out at Yorgen Farmstead as I was getting 3-4 enchanters there vs. 1-2 enchanters at Addle's Stead. I just stood in the south part of the field and waited for them to respawn. I was there for about an hour. <br /><br />Fun story: I was farming EARLY in the morning to avoid competition and Ally. Didn't see anyone one else at all for an hour. Then, as soon as I agro 2 enchanters, a NE dru jumps me. I feared him right into a pack of mobs. Kill the dru, kill the mobs, and the recipe drops at the same time. It was pretty epic :)</div>

Someone in the guild was looking for someone to make the robes for their lock, so I said I would help try to get the recipe since my lock would eventually need it. I parked my hunter in the tower and would hop on it occasionally to clear the tower. I had cleared it about 7 times with no luck.<br /><br />I was browsing on here for rings for my newly-20 priest and saw the defias enhanters might also drop a ring, so after clearing the tower again, I brought my rogue down to duskwood and got it the recipe on the 4th enchanter. So I hopped back on my hunter, cleared the tower one last time, then swung over to the naga area to see if one of the rares with a possible ring was up,<br /><br />While there, I decided to pick a few cat figurines. I picked 5 and got two cat spawns. I almost didn't see the second one and was riding away when I saw the dot on the minimap due to track beasts being on. And the ghost cat dropped the figurine!<br /><br />Now I'm scared - my luck is never this good. Something bad is probably going to balance my karma now!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Swampsackmcgee</b></h3>I made an account just to post about this.<br /><br />Regarding farming this pattern on the new Hardcore Anniversary Realms. I have been farming both locations for the past 3 day. About 14 hours of nothing but these mobs and have not seen a drop. I suspect the drop rate is much lower than provided.<br /><br />If you plan to do this as a SF character or just to try and save the few gold this robe costs, be prepared for a LONG grind. If you get it fast, turn off the game and go buy a lotto ticket. I've gotten epic dungeon loot more consistently than this pattern.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>eldeemo</b></h3>march 2025.. had two characters one at the tower in darkshore , the other in duskwood.. spent about 5 hours total but i got it.. finally in the tower in darkshore, I did get a lot of greens.. it seems like every &quot;round&quot; i'd get a green or a chest spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Snoopy10095</b></h3>After 40 hours and every day last week of trying to get this to drop. I just got it to drop today 5/12/25 on my second run over to the Yorgen Farmstead and got it by the house of one of the Enchanters. I May have killed just 5-6 enchanters today for it drop in wow 20th anniverary phase 4.</div>
