Normally I would think yes because it's a wolf, but the special circumstances surrounding this wolf would also make me feel otherwise, that this item sort of popped up in Bliz minds so they didn't think far enough ahead to make a Kodo or make wolf riding a requisite for this item.  Note all wolf horns (I checked horn of the Dire Wolf, my mount) say \"Requires Wolf Riding 1\" and this does not, so I guess I just answered my question.  I think for continuities sake Tauren should have to have wolf riding, but it's not fair to charge them an extra 12g, assuming they haven't bought wolf riding before. Note this mount is also BoP, so you can't have someone else buy it who has a discount you don't and give it to you, like the other mounts.  For those who don't know what I mean, if say I want a mount that costs me 90g because I do not have the honored rank and I am not a Seargeant, I find a seargeant with some time, give him the 64g(? is my math right) it will cost him for being honored AND seargeant, and then he trades the mount to me and I give him 64 instead of having to pay 90 to the vendor.\n\nNow my second question is, is this thing dropped as well, instead of simply bought?  Allah says its dropped by those people, not sold.  Other mounts on Allah say \"Sold by...\" why not this one.

They are not directly under the Horde in our reputation screens, they are under Horde forces, along with the Warsong Gulch people as well (the other BG, in barrens).  They are usually 800g, however by the time you are exalted with the Frostwolf Clan of Alterac Valley by dominating in that specificaly PvP BG, you, I am assuming, will have lots and lots and lots of honor, hopefully enough to be at least seargeant, and earn the accompanying 10% discount.  So that should take some time, right?  And there is another 10% discount that we can earn worldwide by being 'Honored' with the faction in question.  So you have to be 'exalted' with Frostwolves, which is higher than 'honored', so just by right if you can buy this mount the game takes 10% off the price.  So you need 'exalted' rank with frostwolf clan and preferably have rank 3 and 640 gold.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>23305</b></h3>I noticed what seemed to be a human rider. Can an alliance character get one of these?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BobTheGreat</b></h3>maybe it was just someone who recently ate a savory deviate delight</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This mount is obtainableonce you are exalted with alterac battlegrounds on horde. ANY class can ride it. I am a tauren and I can ride it and it looks sick. The perk is it only costs 640g. You never lose it like PvP mounts because you don't lose faction...very nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blizzard just announced that PVP rewards from Rank are now based on your highest rank achieved and not your current rank.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me about 1.5 weeks to get exalted with AV. It's all about questing, looting, and most definitely winning. The hardest part is just pretty much having the raid work as a whole team instead of having each person do their own thing. I must admit there were times when I got so frustrated, I wanted to quit right then and there. --this close. LoL. But hey, being level 58 with an epic mount is definitely something worth my while =)<br /><br /><a href="http://img397.imageshack.us/img397/7622/wolfie22jo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img397.imageshack.us/img397/7622/wolfie22jo.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To straighten up the facts about this.<br /><br />1. Any race <b>(Horde ONLY)</b> can rid this mount, no riding skill needed.<br /><br />2. It cost 640G<br /><br />3. Taurens riding on this mount make the wolf about a&nbsp; foot taller, If you are thinking real life sizes etc, So a cow does not look wierd riding on it.<br /><br />4. It now requires level 60 to ride this mount.<br /><br />People have said all the above but theres still some people that dont read the whole thread. So look before you post.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah I will agree that it looks similar to the 60 epic,but getting exhaulted has other perks,TuF for example</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What is the wolf's speed? Is it the same as a regular epic mount or even faster?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Trolls look so cool on this mount. I'm a troll and i don't like any of the lvl 60 raptors so i got this aby and its an awsome mount espicialy with&nbsp; a troll on it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I already had my epic mount, which cost me 800g, and now I bought this mount for only 8g (yes, 8g).<br /><br />2 epic mounts for literally the price of 1, sweeet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of 1.12.1<br /><br />You now need the new Epic riding skill to be able to use the Frostwolf. This costs at least 720G. <br />900G without the 20% discount you get at Sergeant (PVP Rank 3)).<br /><br />The mount itself is just 8G, however, in order to ride it you MUST have either:<br /><br />Previously owned a (Non PVP) Epic mount. <br />Paid 720-900G for the ability to ride epic mounts. <br /><br />If you have 75/75 riding skill, that's not enough.<br />If you paid 72-90G for your riding skill, not enough.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is it me or is this mount (pvp mounts in general?) faster than the nonpvp epic mounts?&nbsp; When my team is going for a flag in AB or AV I am usually ahead of everyone and very clearly am faster.&nbsp; I have to stop and wait for people to catch up.&nbsp; I have no speed boosts that I am aware of.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does this mean you could, in theory, get an epic mount before level 60? Doesn't seem like there's a level or skill requirement.<br /><br />If so, then DAMN it's a good item. <br /><br />Oh and one more question: Is that vendor price accurate, or do you get the standard discount for being Honored (Or in this case Exhalted).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where would u buy this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ah yes, finally!<br /><br />Mwahahaha............i have been looking for a Taruen Wolf-Mount all this time......and now I found it!<br /><br />One question though......so you need to get exalted with Orgrimmar in order to ride it?<br /><br />Edited, Fri Sep 2 06:05:33 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i just got one myself.and yes taurens can mount.yes its 800gold bug with the less20% its 640gold.yes eveyone cna mount it even before lvl 60(you need reputation and money).i even gave my wolfie to a lvl 2 player.i hope hes happy :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hi everybody,<br /><br />I scanned the posts so I know u have to be Exalted with Frostwolf and so on... but nobody said if you have to have a minimum rank. Somebody in the game told me you have to be a warlord, is this true? Or are the kills you make getting Exalted also sufficient to get you the required rank? <br /><br />I'm really puzzled, and will be glad if aou can help me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if i stop going on bg after i buy this i can still use it if i loose exalted status?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone figure out what riding skill is needed for this 75 or 125?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just thought, we know from the screens that Tauren can buy and ride this item, but my first question is do they have to buy wolf riding from Orgrimmar first. Normally I would think yes because it's a wolf, but the special circumstances surrounding this wolf would also make me feel otherwise, that this item sort of popped up in Bliz minds so they didn't think far enough ahead to make a Kodo or make wolf riding a requisite for this item. Note all wolf horns (I checked horn of the Dire Wolf, my mount) say &quot;Requires Wolf Riding 1&quot; and this does not, so I guess I just answered my question. I think for continuities sake Tauren should have to have wolf riding, but it's not fair to charge them an extra 12g, assuming they haven't bought wolf riding before. Note this mount is also BoP, so you can't have someone else buy it who has a discount you don't and give it to you, like the other mounts. For those who don't know what I mean, if say I want a mount that costs me 90g because I do not have the honored rank and I am not a Seargeant, I find a seargeant with some time, give him the 64g(? is my math right) it will cost him for being honored AND seargeant, and then he trades the mount to me and I give him 64 instead of having to pay 90 to the vendor.<br /><br />Now my second question is, is this thing dropped as well, instead of simply bought? Allah says its dropped by those people, not sold. Other mounts on Allah say &quot;Sold by...&quot; why not this one. So do Alliance kill the stable master in AV BG and get a mount horn for our side?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Some notes:<br /><br />* Every Horde-race can ride this.<br />* Honored + Sergeant-rank give 20% discount making it cost 640G.<br />* 100% speed-mount.<br />* It is bought from the AV-vendors, just like the other AV-rewards.<br />* You have to be lvl 60 for this.<br />* You can buy this at exalted with Frostwolf Clan, you do NOT require the last 999 rep in exalted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've heard these things cost 640g, but unless you get a 20% discount, one of the two are wrong...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>...yes ... have ppl posted those pictures of taurens riding alterac wolves for nothing ?<br /><br />... taurens can ride Frostwolf Howlers</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>are these mounts the same as the other level 60 mounts, 100% movement speed, or are they faster?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's a BG reward at exalted rep.<br /><br /><a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/rewards-alterac.html" rel="nofollow">http://worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/rewards-alterac.html</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The price isnt 800g. It's &quot;only&quot; 640g.<br /><br />And about taurens..

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>According to Blizzard (<a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/rewards-alterac.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/rewards-alterac.html</a>) this item only costs 10G.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It costs 10g to start but since you obviously are above honored you get 10% off and another 10% if you are above rank 3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Approximately how many wins and/or turnins does it take to get Exalted on AV Weekends? AV Games are long and the Alliance usually wins on my server, I'm wondering if it'd be a waste of time to try to get this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i read the alterac valley rewards page at bliz's site the night they came out....and I knew right away i was getting one of these instead of the regular, or even the 'other' PvP mounts. since there seems to be some confusion, yes taurens can ride this, look at the screeshot links above this post! they are MASSIVE TOWERING LUMBERING BEASTS. pretty funny looking, grats to that guy. and how to get them. you need to be exalted, that is the HIGHEST reputatation rank with the Alterac Valley people (forget what their name is). They are not directly under the Horde in our reputation screens, they are under Horde forces, along with the Warsong Gulch people as well (the other BG, in barrens). They are usually 800g, however by the time you are exalted with the Frostwolf Clan of Alterac Valley by dominating in that specificaly PvP BG, you, I am assuming, will have lots and lots and lots of honor, hopefully enough to be at least seargeant, and earn the accompanying 10% discount. So that should take some time, right? And there is another 10% discount that we can earn worldwide by being 'Honored' with the faction in question. So you have to be 'exalted' with Frostwolves, which is higher than 'honored', so just by right if you can buy this mount the game takes 10% off the price. So you need 'exalted' rank with frostwolf clan and preferably have rank 3 and 640 gold. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok, the frost wolf, used to cost 640g, then the update came, now it costs 8 gold...wow! but you need wolf riding 150, wich costs 720g, now you're paying 728g for something that used to cost 640, i think blizzard shoulda thought a bit harder about that one. kinda defeats the purpose of getting exalted for the &quot;cheap mount&quot; you can save 72g, that is if you put countless hours into AV, pretty pointless, very stupid.</div>
