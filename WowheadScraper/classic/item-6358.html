My main character is a Warlock who already has Herbalsim and Alchemy as professions.  Being an Alchemist requires being an herbalist, at least if you want  to be able to make potions on the fly and get to the hard to find herbs.  However, at the alchemy levels around 80 or so, and then later on, it is extremely difficult to level up without oily blackmouth and then later at 110 or so, firefin snapper.\n\nTherefore, I have decided to make a secondary character that does fishing, and probably cooking.  And perhaps a rogue or a druid, since they can either move fast or with stealth.  I will most likely make a rogue so I can pick locks from any chest I fish up.  But my goals are to first, get good enough to catch these fish, around 75 to 80 in fishing from what I am reading, and at the same time, be able to fish at as low a level of rogue or druid as I can.\n\nSo my question is this, are there any newbie zones, like zones with capital cities in them where I can catch these fish, or at least the oily blackmouth, and if not, what is the lowest class level zone I can fish these in, assuming I have the fishing level needed?\n\nAlso, I am a little confused from the posts.  Is the only way to catch oily blackmouths out of a school or circle of them, or can they also be caught by random in certain areas.  The only schools I have actually seen are in Westfall Longshore.  I am new to the game, so if you answer my question, and give a body of water, please tell me the name of the zone the body of water is in, and\/or the closest Capital City.[\/Darkgray]\n\nThank You So Much for Your Help!\n\n[Chartreuse][i][b]Zaldor[\/b] of [b]Nordrassil[\/b][\/i]\n\nAnd, I am the same Final Fantasy XI Online Character\n[i]\n[b]Zaldor[\/b] of [b]Alexander[\/b][\/i][\/Chartreuse]\n\n[Aqua][b]P.S.[\/b] - If you are on the Darnassil server, and would be willing to make a trade for potions and oily blackmouth, please let me know.  I am just not that good at making money, and I will never be able to afford the 2gp 20 oily blackmouth go for.  The hardest potion I know how to make take 2 of them to make one potion, which means 2 gps for 10 skill levels in alchemy. Just not worth it.  And before I made that one, it took 4 to make one potion, the water breathing one.  Two gps is definitely to much for 5 skill ups and 5 water breathing potions, especially since I have a spell that has the same effect, but last much longer.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There are no longer random catches of certain fish. Oily Blackmouths and Firefin Snappers are used for potions and a worth money. Fishing bots killed this market so Blizzard now make schools of these fish. Very rare to get one of these fish when not fishing in a school. <br /> There are 2 kinds of schools. One is the nice round school. Easy to cast into and guaranteed to catch whatever is in there. The other is a half crescent shaped one. The half one only gets a catch about half the time (some other fish for the rest).<br />&nbsp; There are limited number of fish in a school just like there are limited number of ore or herbs at a spot. Once the limit is reached, the school disappears. (Not timed!)<br /> The best way to fish is to stand in the water between your knees and waist and cast directly at the school. IF YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE BLUE, you will NOT get the fish. Close does not count. If your cast looks good, change your view to see if you really are in the school. If not, recast. <br />&nbsp; To catch these fish, you have to be in the blue. Cast,cast,cast.<br /> The areas for a school are preplanned by Blizzard and will cycle through just like ore or herbs. Certain areas have more schools than others.<br /> Good fishing!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, I just figured out a way to get a <i><b>really</b></i> great catch ratio! <br /><br />Get a fishing pole and go to someplace like Darkshore (shoreline north of Aub is best) or Windsheer Crag (the river, I think, but watch out for mob attacks). Those are the two best places I've noticed, so far, that are lower level areas for either faction.<br /><br />Find the Oily Blackmouth Schools and cast your line <b>into the circle or on the edge of the circle</b> they make. ***Casting outside the circle doesn't work as well.***<br /><br />In many cases you'll come across a school that seems to be in water that isn't <i>'fishable'</i>. In most of those cases (but probably not all) all you have to do is wade out past the school into deeper water and cast inland toward the school. Since they're usually in shallow areas that shouldn't be too hard while still staying above swimming depth. I haven't tested this out in the river yet, but trying different angles of casting might work there too. Just move around until you can hit the target. ^_^<br /><br />The schools do disappear after a random number of catches, but in some cases I caught as many as 7 fish in one school. You may get more than that ^_^<br /><br />Oh! Just to make it faster, I put my fishing ability into a quick bar slot at the bottom in the secondary section so I could recast quickly if the bobber landed outside the circle. ^_^<br /><br />I've caught about 30 in an hour!<br /><br />Hope this helps someone ^_^<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 14th 2006 at 4:31pm PST by Sylraine</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 14th 2006 at 4:43pm PST by Sylraine</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><b>Hello,</b><br /><br />I am hoping at least one of you experience fishermen can tell me what is the safest, as in class level wise, zone to catch oily blackmouth as well as firefin snappers. My main character is a Warlock who already has Herbalsim and Alchemy as professions. Being an Alchemist requires being an herbalist, at least if you want to be able to make potions on the fly and get to the hard to find herbs. However, at the alchemy levels around 80 or so, and then later on, it is extremely difficult to level up without oily blackmouth and then later at 110 or so, firefin snapper.<br /><br />Therefore, I have decided to make a secondary character that does fishing, and probably cooking. And perhaps a rogue or a druid, since they can either move fast or with stealth. I will most likely make a rogue so I can pick locks from any chest I fish up. But my goals are to first, get good enough to catch these fish, around 75 to 80 in fishing from what I am reading, and at the same time, be able to fish at as low a level of rogue or druid as I can.<br /><br />So my question is this, are there any newbie zones, like zones with capital cities in them where I can catch these fish, or at least the oily blackmouth, and if not, what is the lowest class level zone I can fish these in, assuming I have the fishing level needed?<br /><br />Also, I am a little confused from the posts. Is the only way to catch oily blackmouths out of a school or circle of them, or can they also be caught by random in certain areas. The only schools I have actually seen are in Westfall Longshore. I am new to the game, so if you answer my question, and give a body of water, please tell me the name of the zone the body of water is in, and/or the closest Capital City.<br /><br />Thank You So Much for Your Help!<br /><br /><i><b>Zaldor</b> of <b>Nordrassil</b></i><br /><br />And, I am the same Final Fantasy XI Online Character<br /><i><br /><b>Zaldor</b> of <b>Alexander</b></i><br /><br /><b>P.S.</b> - If you are on the Darnassil server, and would be willing to make a trade for potions and oily blackmouth, please let me know. I am just not that good at making money, and I will never be able to afford the 2gp 20 oily blackmouth go for. The hardest potion I know how to make take 2 of them to make one potion, which means 2 gps for 10 skill levels in alchemy. Just not worth it. And before I made that one, it took 4 to make one potion, the water breathing one. Two gps is definitely to much for 5 skill ups and 5 water breathing potions, especially since I have a spell that has the same effect, but last much longer. Thank You.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Apr 23rd 2007 5:12pm by infchaosdrd</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, Apr 23rd 2007 5:14pm by infchaosdrd</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Undet29</b></h3>I've been on the coast of Darkshore and I've found a lot of pools.<br />Required to make <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/?item=5634">Free Action Potions</a> <br /><br />I will be ready for classic phase 2 !<br /><br />LE: I've been in the morning at 4am server time. Beware of population on your server!<br />LE2: Also Ratchet to Northwatch hold coast is cool.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Krysteen</b></h3>Depending on the time of the day, the pools can be heavily fished and if you don't have a mount it can be a huge waste of time.<br /><br />I tested out the wharf at Menethil Harbour. In 20 casts on my level 20 toon with Level 150 fishing I caught the following:<br /><br />Oily Blackmounth x 6<br />Firefine Snapper x 4<br />Raw Rainbow fin Albacore x 10<br /><br />That means that the two useful alchemy fish made up 50% of the catch. On the whole I almost prefer just sitting there and fishing since the number of pools I may get is limited and the running time back and forth negates the benefit. Its only really better if you do it in the middle of the night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ohatcheejack</b></h3>I've been catching these pretty consistently on the Ratchet docks, even outside of their little designated whirlpool areas at around level 145 fishing. <br /><br />A stack of them sells for around 2g on my server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nyxe7</b></h3>For Alliance, I have found that although Darkshore has more nodes, they respawn very slowly. On your first initial clear of the nodes there are plenty, but on your way back and after a few pass-overs the modes are few and far between, I've experienced often times I will get no nodes at all after my first clear of the Darkshore coast. I've found that Westfall is better for consistent farming, the nodes seem to spawn faster there, to where you will get multiple on your way back. This is after multiple hours of farming in each of the zones. Both zones are Non-PvP for Alli, NPC's are also low level and wont aggro compared to other zones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Icewench</b></h3>(Classic HC Update) Fishing Westfall northwest side near crabs so no aggro.<br /><br />Lvl 75-125 fishing (100 catches):<br />- 48 (48%) Raw Rainbow Fin Albacore<br />- 35 (35%) Raw Slitherskin Mackerel<br />- 13 (13%) Oily Blackmouth<br />- 2 (2%) Small Chest<br />- 1 (1%) Message in a Bottle<br />- 1 (1%) Dented Crate</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ssateneth</b></h3>On Classic SOD- if you're alliance, I think Wetlands ocean coast open water fishing is probably your best bet to get both <a href="/classic/item=6359/firefin-snapper">Firefin Snapper</a> and <a href="/classic/item=6358/oily-blackmouth">Oily Blackmouth</a> in relatively efficient numbers. I got about twice as much blackmouth as firefins. I also tried in Stranglethorn (booty bay fishing off the docks) and got about the same amount of each, overall less per time. Hillsbrad ocean fishing off Southshore dock may be about the same %'s as Wetlands.</div>
