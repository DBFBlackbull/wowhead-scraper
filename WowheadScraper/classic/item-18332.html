<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here are all the different librams you can collect remember you can only have 1 book of the same type at once. Once you convert the book in the quest you can(theoretically) carry the same arcanum with you. The two letter abbreviations are BS and DM are for where the quest turn in is for that libram. BS = Burning Steppes DM = Dire Maul<br /><br />What each of the arcanum do: <br />Rumination&nbsp; - BS - 150 mana&nbsp; <br />Constitution - BS - 100 hp&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Tenacity&nbsp; &nbsp; - BS - 125 armor<br />Resilience&nbsp; - BS - +20 fire resistance<br />Voracity&nbsp; &nbsp; - BS - +8 str/agi/sta/int/spi (only 1 stat of the 5)<br />Rapidity&nbsp; &nbsp; - DM - +1% haste to attacks (ranged/melee)<br />Focus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - DM - +8 healing and damage from spells<br />Protection&nbsp; - DM - +1% to dodge</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For weapons, a weapon's speed is shown (top right) as Speed.&nbsp; The lower the number, the faster you attack.&nbsp; Speed is # of seconds between attacks hence, +1% attack speed means the that the number drops by 1%.&nbsp; So if you have a weapon with Speed 2.0 and you equip, it should drop attack speed to 1.98 or something.&nbsp; So yes weapons do show attack speed.&nbsp; Don't know about spells but I would assume that this affects ranged weaponry as well, since they also show Speed, like melee weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Would Rapidity 1% speed or Voracity +8 AGI be better for a hunter?&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway to parse what 1% speed is = to in AGI?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These tend to sell pretty high.<br />Before ZG you were lucky to get even 5g from those and AH was always full.<br />Time passed and they became more and more rare. Price has gone skyhigh.<br />Though I was lucky week ago to get it for 60g. Someone put it up to AH with that low BO.<br />I have seen bids over 160g with 200g BO. I think they go that high too.<br />People do not run DM that much - blizz needs to up the drop imo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Libram of Rapidity only drops from mobs in DM East -_-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive sold 2 of these for 500g each in 1 week - I think the price is rising :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has anyone managed to solo farm one of these off of a Shadowstalker or Felsworn after the patch?&nbsp; Pre-patch I had farmed three over 6-8 hours, post patch I've probably put in 14 hours of time and not seen one Libram off the solo'able demons.&nbsp; I am beginning to think it has bene removed from their loot tables.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blue confirmed.<br /><a href="http://forums-en.wow-europe.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-dungeons-en&amp;t;=60592&amp;p;=1&amp;tmp;=1#post60592" rel="nofollow">http://forums-en.wow-europe.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-dungeons-en&amp;t;=60592&amp;p;=1&amp;tmp;=1#post60592</a><br /><i>In the next patch, the Dire Maul Librams will no longer be a requirement for the Zul'Gurub enchantments. Instead, a new item drop from either Bloodlord Mandokir or Jin'do the Hexxer, along with the class appropriate Voodoo doll will be all that is necessary, making these enchants much more accessible to players. <br /><br />We do plan to incorporate additional use for the Librams, but the specifics are yet to be determined.</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>800-1200g on kalecgos...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>people keep posting comments on how it sells for 150-500 gold on their servers, on bonechewer ive had one on ah for about 3 days now for 6gold and havn't sold it. wish i could get one to drop on one of those servers seriously</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>That's because rapidity was used for the ZG enchant for hunters/rogues ~5 months ago.&nbsp; People were paying upwards of 300g for them.<br /><br />Blizz patched that so that you no longer needed the librams for the zg enchants.<br /><br />Now it's used for a nature resist enchant that's only useful for Aq40/Naxx.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>libram goes for 10-20g on our server<br /><br />not even worth it then imo</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are a number of other books found around the world. They are &quot;lost texts&quot; of the Quel'Thalas High Elves? There are two NPCs that &quot;collect&quot; these when you find them. <br /><br />One NPC, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=9836"><u>Mathredis Firestar</u></a>, is found in Flame Crest in The Burning Steppes. <br />He only accepts Librams of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4481"><u>Constitution</u></a> (100HP), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4483"><u>Resilience</u></a> (20FireResist), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4463"><u>Rumination</u></a> (100mana), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4482"><u>Tenacity</u></a> (125armor), and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4484"><u>Voracity</u></a> (+8 to any stat). <br /><br />The other NPC, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14368"><u>Lorekeeper Lydros</u></a>, can be found in the Library in the <b>Dire Maul</b> instance (North entrance). <br />He accepts Librams of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7484"><u>Focus</u></a> (+8 healing&amp;spelldmg), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7485"><u>Protection</u></a> (1%dodge), and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7483"><u>Rapidity</u></a> (1% haste).<br /><br />Each of these enchants can <b>only</b> be applied to a Head or Leg item. Normal enchants provided by Enchanters cannot enchant Head or Legs, thus making these types of enchants that much more valuable!<br /><br />Each Libram is Unique so you can only carry one at a time. After finding said Librams and taking them to said NPC, the NPC will tell you what items you need to obtain the enchantment each book provides. For more information on how to obtain each of the components requried for the turn-in, click on the link I provided for each book to read about the quest associated with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What does this do?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is needed for the new hunter libram out of ZG, grab them before prices go up. The libram has 10stam 24/28 AP (forget which it was) and 1% to hit. <br /><br />You also need a Primal Hakkari Stanchion, Punctured Voodoo Doll (hunter one) and friendly faction with ZG to turn it in at the quest giver inside ZG at the top of the golden pyramid. <br /><br />I am having trouble turning the libram in to the NPC inside DM library, has anyone done it since the patch? The NPC won't do anything different whether i have the libram on me or not.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I used to get at least one libram of rapidity/focus in a 2 hours session before the patch. Now after the patch I have spent over 3 days killing the soloable mobs in west and east and I've gotten loads of greens, blues and a few epics, but not a SINGLE libram! :O<br /><br />Can anyone confirm this? Or am I just unlucky?</div>
