They vary some, depending on the zone. There is a [url=http:\/\/forums.worldofwarcraft.com\/thread.aspx?FN=wow-professions&T=238707&P=1]very good thread[\/url] on the WoW forums that details some of the things available and the locations, thanks to Pleather on the Stormreaver server for collecting the information. These pools include the new Sagefish and Greater Sagefish, as well as Firefin Snapper, Oily Blackmouth, Deviate Fish, and floating debris piles where you can get (unlocked) trunks that contain crafting materials and equipment. \n \nAlso, in one zone, Azshara, there are swirls called 'Patch of Elemental Water', where you can fish up elemental water items: Globe of Water, Elemental Water, and Essence of Water. Located mostly in the Bay of Storms there, these are arguably the highest level, and most profitable, fishing spots in the game. I've spent some time collecting data on the locations of these pools, and this page is dedicated to detailing this information. \n \nFirst, in order to fish in the Bay of Storms, you need a ridiculous level of fishing skill. A total of 420 is needed to guarantee landing what you catch, though you can make the attempt to fish with as low as 350 (I believe), though you will rarely land a fish with that skill level. Use lures and equipment to raise your skill if needed. The best fishing items can be gotten at the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza contest, so you may want to try that...with the items there, you can get your skill to 350, there is a +2 enchant for gloves, and lures give up to 100 bonus as well. In my observation, if you can get your skill to 420 with some combination of the above, you won't miss many fish at all. I regularly fish at 415, and only miss a very few. \n \nThe pools that contain the elemental items (called a 'Patch of Elemental Water') are spread through the zone in the coastal area known as the Bay of Storms. The area is patrolled by mid-50 level elite giants (as well as a few other mobs), but they're mostly easily avoided if you aren't too low a level. These pools are in set locations around the bay, and it appears that only one (at most) pool is active at a time. There are possibly 7 locations we've discovered, and the locations are shown on the [url=http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/%7Ethalen\/wow\/elemental.jpg]map[\/url] I've made (full size map) \n[url=http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/%7Ethalen\/wow\/swirl_small.jpg]http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/%7Ethalen\/wow\/swirl_small.jpg[\/url] \n \n \nNotes:&nbsp; \n \nLocation 1 is slightly outside the 'Bay of Storms' itself, and requires a lower fishing level&nbsp; \nLocation 2 is at Hetaera's Clutch&nbsp; \nLocation 3 is at Scalebeard's cave&nbsp; \nLocations 4-6 will probably be renumbered when\/if the 'unverified' spot is verified (by me anyway)&nbsp; \nI'll include more information as it comes up, and feel free to contact me if you want to contribute to the cause...I can be reached in-game (Thalenia on Uther), or drop me a note at thalen (at) earthlink.net. \n \n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nHere's a couple pictures of what the swirls in Azshara look like...one from [url=http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/%7Ethalen\/wow\/swirl.jpg]above[\/url], one from [url=http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/%7Ethalen\/wow\/below.jpg]below[\/url] (the latter is from about as far away as the swirl would show up, just to give you an idea at what range you could see them...subject to your graphics settings of course) \n \nAlso, in that same area is something called a 'swirling maelstrom' - part of a quest line somewhere, [url=http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/%7Ethalen\/wow\/maelstrom.jpg]here[\/url] are a [url=http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/%7Ethalen\/wow\/maelstrom2.jpg]couple[\/url] links to what that looks like.","date":"2006-06-18T16:14:34-05:00","rating":47,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"The elemental pools can be active in more than 1 spot at one time actually.

Each is populated by 4 or 5 water elementals that seems to have a 3-5% chance to drop one of these. Just run from one lake to the other and you should never run out of respawns to kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>evoker</b></h3>Or if you are in a hurry you can get an alchemist to transmute Essence of Undeath or Earth to Water, since earth and undeath are easier to find and are sold cheap at the Auction House.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8722</b></h3>I don't know how readable this will be but here's a little diagram of the transmute circle that is possible with elemental essences. The main circle is Earth to Water to Air to Fire and back to Earth. The two branches are Life to Earth to Life and Water to Undeath to Water.<br /><br />Life</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>17923</b></h3>The absolute easiest, and fastest, place to grind these is from Toxic Horrors in Felwood.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=7132">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=7132</a><br /><br />They have among the best drop rate, they're plentiful (not many people grind them now) and they very easy to kill for a 60+.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They still drop from toxic horrors in felwood! Just looted one</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So the 9 something percent drop rate for these off of Toxic Horrors is being screwed up by the high probablity of these mobs dropping nothing when killed. I killed about 30 last night and got loot only 3 times. So... if that extends out at all, loot of 10%, Essence of 10%... that's only a 1% drop rate for these things... certainly different than the 9% or so listed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As at patch 1.7, I believe an undocumented change was the removal of the drop from mobs in the Eastern Plaguelands. Please post if you do get a drop from these mobs.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, this only leaves Felwood. Which is camped to buggery by farmers with Hunters. Prices start at 5g for one essence on the AH (Earthen Ring realm).<br /><br />I'd be looking to get an Alchemist to transmute Essence of Undeath to these. It's probably easier now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They do still drop off mobs in Eastern Plaguelands. I came across them yesterday night while coming from Darrowshire on my way to Light's Hope Chapel, just south of Corin's Crossing. Was trying to make some Stormshroud gear, and decided to try my luck. Went one round of the pond, killing maybe 15-20 mobs, got my first drop. That motivated me to do another, so I did, and got another drop. One round took maybe 15 minutes, and I did 5, with the total result of 4 Essences of Water, 3 Globes of Water and a few random greens. <br /><br />Haven't tried Felwood purely because it's just a dozen times slower what with all the farming and farm-related ganking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Reguarding farming elementals: roll a warlock.<br />- Voidwalker on 1 - then use CoA and Corr (do this twice)<br />- Doom one, then use rank 2 then rank 1 banish, make sure to tag it first using a wand or dagger.<br />- Fear Dot kite one.<br /><br />thats 3 possibly 4 per minute.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you have a high fishing level, you can fish these in Azshara! In the coast, some whirlpools like the sagefish/tastyfish pools form up,called Patch of Elemental Water. As you can guess, these could yield elemental water, but also globe of water and essence of water!However, these things only appear like 3 at a time all along the coast, so finding them becomes quite tedious, but it sure beats killing mobs all day...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There are three verified spots to fish essence of water (thotbot has map) BUT the catch is, they aren't there all the time.&nbsp; So you spend half an hour finding one spot, get four casts in (2 globes of water, 2 essence of water), and then the pool is gone.<br /><br />AND DOESN'T REAPPEAR ANYWHERE!<br /><br />so the pools appear only, oh, once a day, and when you fish from that spot, they're gone for that day.&nbsp; a long haul to save a few gold.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In patch 1.9, Blizz added special fishing pools, or as I sometimes call them, swirls, that contain specific items. They vary some, depending on the zone. There is a <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-professions&amp;T=238707&amp;P=1" rel="nofollow">very good thread</a> on the WoW forums that details some of the things available and the locations, thanks to Pleather on the Stormreaver server for collecting the information. These pools include the new Sagefish and Greater Sagefish, as well as Firefin Snapper, Oily Blackmouth, Deviate Fish, and floating debris piles where you can get (unlocked) trunks that contain crafting materials and equipment. <br /><br />Also, in one zone, Azshara, there are swirls called 'Patch of Elemental Water', where you can fish up elemental water items: Globe of Water, Elemental Water, and Essence of Water. Located mostly in the Bay of Storms there, these are arguably the highest level, and most profitable, fishing spots in the game. I've spent some time collecting data on the locations of these pools, and this page is dedicated to detailing this information. <br /><br />First, in order to fish in the Bay of Storms, you need a ridiculous level of fishing skill. A total of 420 is needed to guarantee landing what you catch, though you can make the attempt to fish with as low as 350 (I believe), though you will rarely land a fish with that skill level. Use lures and equipment to raise your skill if needed. The best fishing items can be gotten at the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza contest, so you may want to try that...with the items there, you can get your skill to 350, there is a +2 enchant for gloves, and lures give up to 100 bonus as well. In my observation, if you can get your skill to 420 with some combination of the above, you won't miss many fish at all. I regularly fish at 415, and only miss a very few. <br /><br />The pools that contain the elemental items (called a 'Patch of Elemental Water') are spread through the zone in the coastal area known as the Bay of Storms. The area is patrolled by mid-50 level elite giants (as well as a few other mobs), but they're mostly easily avoided if you aren't too low a level. These pools are in set locations around the bay, and it appears that only one (at most) pool is active at a time. There are possibly 7 locations we've discovered, and the locations are shown on the <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ethalen/wow/elemental.jpg" rel="nofollow">map</a> I've made (full size map) <br /><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ethalen/wow/swirl_small.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ethalen/wow/swirl_small.jpg</a> <br /><br />Notes:&nbsp; <br /><br />Location 1 is slightly outside the 'Bay of Storms' itself, and requires a lower fishing level&nbsp; <br />Location 2 is at Hetaera's Clutch&nbsp; <br />Location 3 is at Scalebeard's cave&nbsp; <br />Locations 4-6 will probably be renumbered when/if the 'unverified' spot is verified (by me anyway)&nbsp; <br />I'll include more information as it comes up, and feel free to contact me if you want to contribute to the cause...I can be reached in-game (Thalenia on Uther), or drop me a note at thalen (at) earthlink.net. <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />Here's a couple pictures of what the swirls in Azshara look like...one from <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ethalen/wow/swirl.jpg" rel="nofollow">above</a>, one from <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ethalen/wow/below.jpg" rel="nofollow">below</a> (the latter is from about as far away as the swirl would show up, just to give you an idea at what range you could see them...subject to your graphics settings of course) <br /><br />Also, in that same area is something called a 'swirling maelstrom' - part of a quest line somewhere, <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ethalen/wow/maelstrom.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a> are a <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ethalen/wow/maelstrom2.jpg" rel="nofollow">couple</a> links to what that looks like.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First of whartanto Im not flaming you, just some constructive critism.<br /><br />Plz look at how many toxic horrors it took to compile the 6.84% drop rate - 196,528!<br /><br />You killed 67... great foundation to base your personal 2% drop rate on.<br /><br />What your doing is like a man you gets a 4 of a kind in poker at Vegas after 4 hands and decides the chance for a royal flush is 25%<br /><br />From personal exp these drop MUCH MUCH MUCH better than airs drop in Silithus which is a posted 2% drop - so the drop rate listed here sounds reasonable and accurate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fished a couple of pools in Azshara yesterday called &quot;Patch of Elemental Water&quot;. Got a total of 4 Essences out of the deal. After I fished out the first one (maybe 5 casts?) I went swimming around the zone for about 10 minutes, looking for more, and found one, and fished that one out, too. 4 Essence in about 15 minutes total, on top of the usual Stonescale/Winter Squid/Lobsters/Mightfish.<br /><br />I'd be interested to know if the pools only spawn at night, or if there's a limited #/day. Makes me want a cottage in Azshara.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just got 4 essences out of 2 patches of water, 1 from 1 and 3 from another all in l5 minutes, great money. I'm just gonna log out and log bak in once they have respawned and do it all again and hopefully by then the 3rd one i go to has respawned aswell at this rate i could get like 5+ an hour which isnt too bad - i think. Apart from azshara does anyone know another good place that has a few elemental patches?<br /><br /><i>Edited, Apr 26th 2007 7:36am by Zecandyman</i></div>

Needed to go afk, couple of hours later got another 3 in 30-40 mins.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been camping azshara for these just to see what the deal is for a few days now. Finally found one. I wasn't sure if they would be easy to spot, thought I might have missed them, but once you see one you can't miss it. They are blue and glowing, really obvious. 342 was not enough to catch anything in a pool, so I had to use a +75 lure to get up to 417 to be able to fish it.<br /><br />Coords:<br />79.54-southern corner of the ruins that stuck up out of water. This is the first island on the map, just south of Temple of Arkkoran. Got 2 Elemental Water before the pool dried up. Got this one again the next day for 3 Globes of water and 1 Essence of Water.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Mar 2 13:17:17 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>drop rate is pretty good, good 3 in like 30 mins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the drop rate at the southern lake in EPL is at this point I believe to be one drop per year, or so it feels. I killed for about an hour yesterday and got one, been at it for about an hour today and none. <br /><br />If you need more than one of these things, I recommend giving up, and get a 300 herbalist. Spend your time gathering herbs. I can sell enough herbs to buy 10 essences off AH probably in the time it takes to farm 3 or 4 essences.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dunno how many mobs i killed but in less then 25mins i had 3 of these essences. but that was in the middle of the night so i was alone there so it was a non stop killing spree, no waiting for respawns.</div>
