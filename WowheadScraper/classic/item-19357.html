Oh my gosh, there are better weapons out there than any bloody class could use be it warrior, paladin, shaman, or druid. Christ.\n\nPaladins:\nHey now, those are some pretty sweet stats for everything that a pally uses in a fight. And that DPS is amazing as well. Obviously paladins would be able to reap loads of benefits from this weapon.\n\nBut, it is in no way a paladin only weapon.\n\nAfter all, if, as many people have claimed, paladins are nothing more than heal bots in high end raids, then why should they even be worried about DPS? Shouldn't they be more worried about how their healing is being affected? And for healing, a paladin doesn't even need this weapon. If a paladin is only a heal bot, then they should be using Hammer of Ji'zhi which gives more int and an increase to healing abilities; being one of only two epic two handed maces that does this. \n\nThe problem here is, paladins want to be stuck in an heal bot lockbox just as much as the duids and shamans do, so they all try and put down the other classes in order to get them better weapons.\n\nShaman:\nThe same rules that apply to the paladin pretty much apply to the shaman as well. They can benefit from an increase to every one of those stats mentioned as well as from the high DPS out put of this weapon. \n\nBut the same rules that apply to the paladin apply to the shaman as well. They are heal bots in high level raids and nothing more. So, they should focus more on their healing capabilities instead of how much damage they can do which they won't even get done since they are too busy keeping the real damagers healthy.\n\nDruids:\nAnd here is the problem. Why on earht would a druid ever want this? Same reason that the other two classes do; it's one of the few maces that raises all of their main stats at once. \n\nYes, it is true that a druid will not benefit at all from the DPS of this weapon, but druids are more stat based than the other two classes are for that reason. When shifting, druids recieve a greater return to their damage out put from stats, and none from their weapon, therefore they need the stats even more than the other classes do. \n\nThe problem here is, every class wants to say that the other should only be functioning as a heal bot, when the truth of the matter is that the only real heal bots out there are priests. Paladins, shamans, and druids should only be secondary healers for when the priests can't handle it all, not your primary. Yeah, none of them will be able to do more damage than your rouges, or take as much damage as the warriors, but can those two classes heal at all? No. Paladins, shamans, and druids should be dealing high amounts of secondary damage, which all class can do with this weapon, and back up healing any one who needs it, which this weapon also helps all three classes with.\n\nOn a final note, about how a druid can use other weapons, namely staves. Ummm, guess what? Priests, warlocks, and mages can also use staves. That's three other classes that a druid has to compeat with in order to get a good weapon, not to mention any other druids that might be out there. Wouldn't you rather compeat with only one other class as well?","date":"2006-05-03T11:23:50-05:00","rating":19,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Drasil","importedSubject":"Paladin, Shaman, and Druids; oh my!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":16,"id":2674483,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I have a 60 Paladin and a 60 Druid... and this is a Paladin\/Shaman mace.\n\nThe high top damage is wasted on a Druid.","date":"2006-07-15T11:23:50-05:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"tonicstyles","importedSubject":"Paladin\/Shaman or Druid?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":17,"id":2674496,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Im enhancement and wielding drake talon cleaver atm but this weapon beats it handsdown.

They dont need int on cat form? D'oh. As you're aware, warriors or rogues cant heal either when they're grinding, this is due their so said higher dps wich allows them kill mobs faster.

Although the damage, speed, and all the stats work well for paladins and shamans, the lack of proc and high number on the stats attracts druids; even though the item's DPS is a non-factor for druids.<br /><br />Don't let drama tear up the guild over it, the droprate is fairly decent and shamans, paladins, and druids should all have better &quot;raid responsible&quot; weapons anyhow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7119</b></h3>Great DPS weapon for a Paladin, although as the poster above said, in raid you'll rarely be able to equip it, as your main focus should be on healing and healing alone.<br /><br />Outside of that, though, it is great for PvP and is actually very efficient if paired with a +22 Int enchant.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4172</b></h3>This weapon is loaded with stats, making it an amazing druid weapon, especially with a +25 agi/+22 intellect enchant. It's also great for paladins, mostly for PvP. Warriors cannot take much advantage from these stats, however. Shamans can use it quite well, too. I believe this is a top-notch druid pvp monster =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I was the first in my guild to get this. It is an awesome weapon for druids, paladins and shaman. I happen to play a paladin and all you noobs who scream &quot;hunter weapon / warrior weapon&quot; &lt;insert other random idiot comment here&gt; will probably never ever see BWL let alone get to the final bosses.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just got this on my shaman, and I must say the dmg is pretty nice. Best windfury streak so far was on an alliance mage for crit 398 crit 704 crit 614. Very worth the dkp for anyone that would like it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have two 60 druids (one alliance, one horde) as well as a 60 paladin.<br /><br />I think feral druids have a <u>weak case</u> for this item for one particular reason: weapon swapping.&nbsp; Any good druid swaps weapons as soon as he/she shapeshifts.&nbsp; And by BWL, a druid should have a good healing weapon which should have a +55 healing enchant on it (some may have int/spi).&nbsp; As soon as a druid hits the bear form, they swap to a good feral weapon (Unyielding Maul, TUF, Bonecrusher) that has +15 STR/AGI on it.<br /><br />However, some Druids want one weapon for everything.&nbsp; They can't be bothered with worrying over what might be 'ideal', they are used to getting purples quickly as being part of a rare (and thus prima donna) class.&nbsp; This is lazy in my opinion, and clearly does not make the best use of the class' abilities.<br /><br />The Herald of Woe really is meant for someone who uses <u>all its stats all the time.</u>&nbsp; Shamans and Paladins melee and cast in the same 'mode'. There is no 'melee' mode or 'casting' mode for them, they are casting -&gt; swinging -&gt; casting over and over.&nbsp; Thus they need a weapon that serves them for both <u>at the same time</u>.&nbsp; Secondly, the dps/weapon damage on Herald of Woe is significantly higher than anything else a shaman or paladin is likely to get in BWL, MC, or Onyxia... and druids make no use of this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>in my opinion(ppl should say this more often)<br /><br />best use of this weapon is by a pally or shaman, and 2nd choice would be feral druid, why?<br /><br />Pallies need a good allround hammer.<br /><br />Shamans would own anyone with windfury plus this beast.<br /><br />Feral Druids however they cant use the DPS or Weapon Speed.<br />Draconic Maul would be much more useful with +2 Crit and a +15agi enchant. the INT and SPT is very cool, but not nessesary(in my opinion). The epic one-hand druid mace that boosts attack power would also be better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is one of the top 10 melee damage 2 handers in the game.<br /><br />One of the top 5 actually.<br /><br />You do not hand over one of the hardest hitting weapons before the stats are even calculated to a Feral Druid.<br /><br />This is not a staff. This is not a trinket or a bracer. This is not something a player should have on them for merely the stats. Feral Druids would WASTE this weapon in every single way.<br /><br />Any guild that does not see this is simply out of their minds.<br /><br />A weapon of this caliber is designed to strike the enemy. This is a 2 handed mace with a drastically large damage range, and purposefully slowed down for an amazing weapon proc rate. A Feral Druid will never, ever exploit or even use this weapon in any fashion. <br /><br />It might as well be a piece of armor for all the Druids would care.<br /><br />You'll have to excuse me, but if you have a Shaman or Paladin in your guild who want this, do your guild a favor, and stop feeding whatever Feral Druid you have in your guild who is doing nothing for your raid run except Not Healing, and hand this over to them.<br /><br />A Paladin or Shaman will do EVERYTHING they have better with this weapon, all at the same time. They will heal better, hit harder, for longer periods of time. You let a Druid take this, you are giving them passive abilities so that their kitty or bear form will be able to do a few more points of damage. If they want the Int on it, there are plenty of Staves in the game for that purpose.<br /><br />Which a Paladin cannot use. A Paladin cannot use a Staff, they do not have the option. Rarely will you ever see a weapon so obviously designed to help a Paladin gain stats in this role. A Shaman less so since they can use a Staff, but even they are more of a weapon melee role in 5man and PvP than a Druid will ever in his wildest fantasy.<br /><br />Don't make this weapon be nothing more than a slot item. It's the Herald of Woe. Give it to someone who will actually, wow...use it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As feral druid I'm happily passing this to any paladin. The stats are in general more focused towards paladins/shamans. We don't have any kind of loot rules in BWL (since we consider ourselves to be mature enough to handle it) so I could get it any day if I wanted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why is there so many complains over who can use this damnable weapon? Oh my gosh, there are better weapons out there than any bloody class could use be it warrior, paladin, shaman, or druid. Christ.<br /><br />Paladins:<br />Hey now, those are some pretty sweet stats for everything that a pally uses in a fight. And that DPS is amazing as well. Obviously paladins would be able to reap loads of benefits from this weapon.<br /><br />But, it is in no way a paladin only weapon.<br /><br />After all, if, as many people have claimed, paladins are nothing more than heal bots in high end raids, then why should they even be worried about DPS? Shouldn't they be more worried about how their healing is being affected? And for healing, a paladin doesn't even need this weapon. If a paladin is only a heal bot, then they should be using Hammer of Ji'zhi which gives more int and an increase to healing abilities; being one of only two epic two handed maces that does this. <br /><br />The problem here is, paladins want to be stuck in an heal bot lockbox just as much as the duids and shamans do, so they all try and put down the other classes in order to get them better weapons.<br /><br />Shaman:<br />The same rules that apply to the paladin pretty much apply to the shaman as well. They can benefit from an increase to every one of those stats mentioned as well as from the high DPS out put of this weapon. <br /><br />But the same rules that apply to the paladin apply to the shaman as well. They are heal bots in high level raids and nothing more. So, they should focus more on their healing capabilities instead of how much damage they can do which they won't even get done since they are too busy keeping the real damagers healthy.<br /><br />Druids:<br />And here is the problem. Why on earht would a druid ever want this? Same reason that the other two classes do; it's one of the few maces that raises all of their main stats at once. <br /><br />Yes, it is true that a druid will not benefit at all from the DPS of this weapon, but druids are more stat based than the other two classes are for that reason. When shifting, druids recieve a greater return to their damage out put from stats, and none from their weapon, therefore they need the stats even more than the other classes do. <br /><br />The problem here is, every class wants to say that the other should only be functioning as a heal bot, when the truth of the matter is that the only real heal bots out there are priests. Paladins, shamans, and druids should only be secondary healers for when the priests can't handle it all, not your primary. Yeah, none of them will be able to do more damage than your rouges, or take as much damage as the warriors, but can those two classes heal at all? No. Paladins, shamans, and druids should be dealing high amounts of secondary damage, which all class can do with this weapon, and back up healing any one who needs it, which this weapon also helps all three classes with.<br /><br />On a final note, about how a druid can use other weapons, namely staves. Ummm, guess what? Priests, warlocks, and mages can also use staves. That's three other classes that a druid has to compeat with in order to get a good weapon, not to mention any other druids that might be out there. Wouldn't you rather compeat with only one other class as well?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have a 60 Paladin and a 60 Druid... and this is a Paladin/Shaman mace.<br /><br />The high top damage is wasted on a Druid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im enhancement and wielding drake talon cleaver atm but this weapon beats it handsdown. Druids use the stats more efficiently but shammys use the dps wich druids dont. For all classes it is a solo/pvp weapon since those 3 classes all heal in raids. And if you use this weapon to heal plz go play spunsbob the game or something and Learn2Play. Dropped twice for us, feral druids passed for enhancement shammy and im sure they will pass it for me to. Long story short: druids use the stats more effectifly but dont use the uber dps on it. pallys and shammy on the other hand use t all, si imno it should go to them first, sorry druids i love furbutts but just my 2 cents. Its a close call though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a non *!@#kid/leet druid:<br />Yes, this weapon is for Shamans or Paladins, as they can use the DPS better than a druid.<br />However, for a druid in PvP the stats really needed are strength, stamina and int.. Spirit is, and has always been, &quot;priest and druid stat&quot; as noone else wants it as primary, hehe :)<br />anyways.. this mace would be really good for a druid, as there is no other 2h-mace out with the same stats, however! It would benefit a shaman/paladin better.<br />As SuAside said, it is better to get the Hammer of Bestial Fury +offhand combo for a druid.<br /><br />and as for Xaneroth, his peers and other children who share his vision: Reroll a mainstat int toon, you nobrained retard!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok to say a feral druid would never see bwl is just moronic because im a feral druid and have attended every single one of my guilds bwl runs and get to roll on both healing and feral gear while im there. basicly if your guild uses dkp then if you earned the dkp you get to spend it on whatever you want even if its a feral druid putting a want on a weapon such as this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a feral druid, if still young, but I can definitely see how this item would be useful to a feral. I would have to agree however that the pure attack power would benefit the paladin and shaman quite a bit, this is a hefty little weapon, but the stats undeniably help the druid who already have to fight rogues for most of their armor. But at the end of the day, this is a raid drop, which means a person is probably going to use DKP, in if a nice little feral has the DKP to spend, and the weapon is clearly an upgrade, then their is no reason they shouldn't have their hand in the cookie jar too. We all need a little epic in our life.</div>

I'm so happy with this mace, sick looking and crazy damage on my WF crits. I wasn't sure if I should get crusader or +25 agility on it, since I was losing 2% crit from my former weapon (TuF). I had 2 orbs laying around and decided to go with crusader for now.<br />Who should get it? <br />I'm so sick of that question, but I think that shammys/pallies and druids have the same &quot;right&quot; to bid on it, the stats on it are awesome for all 3.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You know, the more I'm looking at this weapon, especially the dps, along with the other stats, the more I'm thinking it wouldn't be out of place on a post 1.8 balance spec druid. A balance druid uses a combo of physical attacks and nukage to maximise his dps.. And this mace would certainly assist in that. Would there be more utilization in the hands of a pally? Perhaps.. But would still be a sweet weapon for a post 1.8 balance druid, not just a feral one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For a fact:<br /><br />Druids are, despite being specced for a &lt;insert spec&gt;, a hybrid class. Thus they will find use for all the stats in this weapon. Yes they might not want to wear it when they mainheal you on instance but as you MIGHT have heard there's BC comming out where you have whole new 10 levels to do, and personaly I dont think druids will be healing mobs to the grave.<br /><br />What is it? They dont need int on cat form? D'oh. As you're aware, warriors or rogues cant heal either when they're grinding, this is due their so said higher dps wich allows them kill mobs faster. Even if druids lose a small portion of their total dps due this they gain ability to go caster, heal, and be ready for next mob straight away. This is where intellect kicks in, did I mention that manarege works in feral forms? Oh yea...<br /><br />So...<br />Might not be top 1 choise for retradin, since they want crit.<br />Might not be top 1 choise for heladin, since they want to have +healing probably. <br />Might not be top 1 choise for resto druid, due not having that much caster stats. Might not be top 1 choise for feral druid, due not having that much feral stats.<br /><br />But I sure want this to go with my judgement (STR enchants ftw, makes it valid all-around set, in other words hybrid set) &amp; aq20/40 stuff. One of the few items where STR meets INT. With decend-to-good dps for an item having such a good stat-pool. Afraid I had to pass on this to other pally due hoarding dkp for judgement chest but certainly will want this before BC if possible.<br /><br />Oh yea and enchant with agi / str for ferals, its great. Maybe spelldmg &amp; healing (Yes its healing too nowdays) for paladins to even further push the hybrid element. TBC comes out, perfect for xping on hybrid gear, having healing capabilities wich will still be more than decend, while actualy being able to output decend dps (Decend in terms of solo farming, raidbuffed &lt;insert class&gt; can offcorse outdps, wich Im not even suprised.).<br /><br />Idea was not to push on that having this will make paladin dps class, but to point out our class description as hybrid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Definatly a hunter weapon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>pics anyone? btw hunters pwn :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK I need to state up front that I am a feral druid. This mace is decent for feral druids, but serves Shammys and Pallys better...here is why:<br /><br />As a feral druid, the DPS on a weapon means nothing to us unless we are in humanoid form, which we rarely are if we are feral. So, what we are concerned with in weapons is stats. Why? Because they add ATTACK POWER which increases our damage output.<br /><br />With the Herald of Woe here we gain:<br />+62 Attack Power (31 str x 2 modifier = 62 AP) All Forms<br />+22 Stam<br />+17 Spirit<br />+20 Int<br /><br />With Hammer of Beastial Fury + offhand Tomb of Knowledge (+8 all skills):<br />Bear: +196 AP (13 str + 8 str x 2 modifier) + 154 AP from hammer = 196<br />Cat: +204 AP (13 str + 8 str x 2 modifier) + 8 Agility modifier in cat form + 154 AP from hammer = 204<br />+20 Stam<br />+8 Spirit<br />+8 Int<br /><br />Which setup would you prefer? I've made my choice.<br /><br />P.S. these numbers are assuming you DON'T have Heart of the Wild.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Dec 13 16:25:56 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Please. Druids dont &quot;waste&quot; weapon dps.<br /><br />They can however benefit the most of all classes from stats. Inherent and talentbased bonuses to armor, str, stam, int, ap and so on.<br /><br />The reason druids would want this now? <br /><br />The same reason any class want anything. It could be any number of raids to one of the 4 dragons before hammer of bestial ever drops, and you'd have to get them before someone else does. <br />This however being from a static instance boss - if it drops, and you have the DKP to spend, its a weapon in your pocket, right away. <br /><br />If it was me I wouldnt mind bidding against any of the other related classes.<br /><br />If Im not mistaken, with finkles lava dregder, a druid would give up about 40 points in stats for 9 regen and 15 fire resist. So I wouldnt call that &quot;better off&quot;. Id say it depends on what you need and want.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jan 26 06:29:01 2006</div>
