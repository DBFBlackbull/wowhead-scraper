There are two ways, already breifly mentioned in this section, that are superior. I will go a little bit more in-depth so you can start making easy money on your herbalist. One of them is supposed to be combined with fishing and you will need atleast 225.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to go in to the gold per hour on these farms as it depends so much on supply and demand on each server. But, I can say that on my server both of these farms are easy 30g\/h.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and let me know if I should update or change something to make it better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]#1 Maraudon Instance[\/b]\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Level 60[\/li]\r\n[li]Herbalism 245+[\/li]\r\n[li]Any class[\/li]\r\n[\/ul]\r\n\r\n[i]There are more superior ways to increase the farm in Maraudon with some classes, but this focus on something all classes can do as long as you have herbalism.[\/i]\r\n\r\nYou start at Orange Side, picking all the nodes outside instance portal first. When you enter you make your way all the way to the Poison Falls and picking the nodes along the way. Be careful at the last corner as you might have to wait for the lasher to move a bit to side before you go by, hugging the wall. Orange Side is the hardest one and might need some practice to get good speed. But keep in mind that at level 60 you can go much closer to the mobs then you might think. All nodes in Orange can be picked.\r\n\r\nWhen you come to the Poison Falls it's one tricky node that can be skipped if you want to be safe. If not, this node is on the top ledge of Poison Falls and should be checked before you jump down. It's surrounded by 4 oozes and can only be picked at one spot to not aggro. If you do aggro the pack, you can reset it by going all the way [url=https:\/\/classic.wowhead.com\/npc=12225\/celebras-the-cursed]Celebras the Cursed[\/url], look for the tree to his left and jump up on the mountain side and stay until you loose combat. The rest of the nodes in Poison Falls are easy. Jump all the way down and run towards Celebras, there are 2-3 nodes along the way.\r\n\r\nOnce Orange and Poison Falls nodes have been picked you make your way to Purple Side. This is much easier. You simply just start make your way to the entrance picking all the nodes. There is one passage that is guarded by 2 Satyrs and 4 Imps that can't be dodged. Here you are supposed to aggro the pack. When you run through, jump straight down and run all the way to the portal, dodge all the patrols and packs and look for where the nodes are. When you go out of the instance, go straight back in and you should be out of combat. Now go back on Purple Wing, pick the nodes and then go back out. Now pick all the nodes outside the instance while you make your way from Purple Entrance to Orange Entrance. Reset the instance when you have reached the Orange Entrance.\r\n\r\nThis run should be about 15:30ish mintues in speed, so it's safe to rinse and repeat as many times as you want. If you find yourself doing it to fast, you can go past Celebras and check for nodes in the start of Green Wing and then go back to Purple Wing.\r\n\r\n__________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]#2 Skulk Rock Fish-o-rama![\/b]\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Level 60[\/li]\r\n[li]Herbalism 245+[\/li]\r\n[li]Fishing 225+[\/li]\r\n[li]Any class[\/li]\r\n[\/ul]\r\n\r\nThis is by far the easiest way to farm the famous shrooms! [url=https:\/\/classic.wowhead.com\/maps?data=47:574394]Skulk Rock[\/url] is a famous farming spot in The Hinterlands and can be very occupied. So this can be a hit or miss. If however the cave is empty, it's a very relaxed and good farm.\r\n\r\nMake your way to Skulk Rock, if you are Alliance fly to [url=https:\/\/classic.wowhead.com\/npc=8018\/guthrum-thunderfist]Guthrum Thunderfist[\/url] or if Horde fly to [url=https:\/\/classic.wowhead.com\/npc=4314\/gorkas]Gorkas[\/url]. Go inside the cave, first do a full tour of the cave to check for nodes. When all nodes are picked you go to the little puddle and stand with your back against the wall and start fish. From here you can see new nodes spawning while you are catching fish like [url=https:\/\/classic.wowhead.com\/item=13759\/raw-nightfin-snapper]Nightfin Snapper[\/url] and [url=https:\/\/classic.wowhead.com\/item=13760\/raw-sunscale-salmon]Sunscale Salmon[\/url]. There is a 10ish minutes respawn time on the nodes.

Best if you can stealth and are lvl 60 (Druid in my case).\n\n[b]Skulk Rock[\/b]\nStart here. There are three node clusters, each will randomly pop ONE mushroom every 10-15 min, so one on the upper ring of the cave, and one in each or the two lower cave alcoves.

This cave can get pretty competitive, so learn to 'own' it - get the timer so it's your cave.\n\n[b]Jintha'alor[\/b]\nMount up and ride up to the top of Jintha'alor. The mobs along the way may hit you but they can't dismount you. Ignore them. At the top across from the last stairwell is a cave. Run past the two guards and grab the mushroom inside. There is only ever one. Again, 10-15 min timer.\n\nHead out of the cave and head to the Elite cave - this is where you need stealth. The elites here will agro, and can be a pain if you get more than one. Sometimes you need to kill one or two in order to get the mushroom they are next to, but most can easily get picked without. Like Skulk Rock, there are 3 herb clusters with several nodes, two in the entry tunnels, one in the back of the cave. So all told, 4 mushrooms atop Jintha'alor. \n\nJust like that, you have 7 Ghost Mushroom.

These are the key ingrediaent in elixir of shadow power and elixir of demonslaying.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Biscuits</b></h3>Another good spot for this is in the Scarlet Monestary Graveyard side, enter the instance and there will be 2-3 nodes. After you collect them you can leave the instance and reset it and go back in there, do this a couple times or until you can't anymore. If you have multiple accounts with Herbs on them it makes some good money.<br /><br />Farm a bunch of these and you can make stacks of Greater Shadow Protection Potions which usually go for a good amount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9193</b></h3>Maraudon is a great place to farm these. A lot nodes can be found inside the instance itself and just outside the instance in the caverns. In a lot cases you can avoid any fighting to reach them if you are Lv 60. Being a rogue makes gathering Ghost Mushroom inside Maraudon very easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3693</b></h3>With a 62 mage, I've found the best strategy is a loop in the Hinterlands from Skulk Rock to Jintha'alor and back. As mentioned above there are three spawn groups inside Skulk Rock so there are almost always three spawns up there. Ride down to Jintha'alor and enter the cave behind the altar to find three more spawn groups. Double back north to Sharpbeak's cave and there's one last spawn. At this level the mobs don't bother me unless I walk through them and I can farm 7 mushrooms every 15 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ghost mushroom are found in caves.If you see one on your minimap and you cant find it anywhere look around for a nearby cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As stated before, you don't need any type of seatlth-seeing, i.e. pots or Perception; Ghost Mushrooms are greyed out on your mini map because they are below ground in caves.&nbsp; I've only found Ghost Mushrooms in the cave leading to Maurodon in Desolace (possible in the instance, I don't know, haven't been there before) and the ooze cave in Hinterlands.&nbsp; Biggest pain 'bout these guys is that they're slow spawns and they're only gathered in single batches, whereas other herbs you can gather in twos or threes as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just found some ghost mushroom last night in Maraudon, and it did say that Herbalism was required to pick it.&nbsp; In fact, Thottbot lists Ghost Mushroom in their Herbalism category as needing Herbalism level 245 to pick it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>from my expierence the caves in the hinterlands (skull rock) is a decent, low risk place to get ghost mushrooms. I have found 3 mushrooms in the cave at one time and the respawn time is aprox. 10 mins. I was in the hinterlands gathering sungrass so when I passed by the cave i stealthed in, picked up the 3 mushrooms and stealthed out. I then went to gather some other herbs and when I passed by again 3 new mushrooms had spawned inside (all were in different places than before). good luck, hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1. Dire Maul East<br />2. Maraudon Orange/Purple<br />3. Skull Rock in the Hinterlands<br />4. The elite troll cave with the ancient egg.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ghost mushrooms are almost sorta kinda like the Dark Iron Ore of Herbalism. They are not nearly as expensive, they aren't quite as hard to get, no one else but Alchemists wants them (though some want stuff made out of them) - but they only grow in a select few locations.<br /><br />For the most part, you'll find them in certain instances - instances like Mauradon and Dire Maul. They cannot be found just scattered around the world.<br /><br />There is one, and ONLY one location where Ghost Mushrooms grow without an army of Elites guarding them - and that's Skulk Rock in the Hinterlands. However, very few mushrooms grow there (though very few mushrooms grow ANYWHERE - you'd be lucky to get even a handful of them on an instance run). <br /><br />So - if you want to make a regular business on Ghost Dye, or any other stuff made from them, I'd say &quot;don't bother&quot;. They're something of a rarity.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have found the best place to farm these. Maraudon.<br /><br />You don't even need to enter an instance, just outside the instance there are already 3-4 ghost mushrooms around. Just go there, gather them up, logout or do something else for about 10 minutes, and huzzah, they are all back again. I'v made about over 30 in 2 days without even trying; just waiting to find a group. <br /><br />Running an actual instance also helps, but then you can't be outside farming them =(<br /><br />Unless of course if you are a rogue... then you have it REALLY easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The best way i found to get these is to go to Skulk Rock in the Hinterlands and get the 3 out of there. Then go up Jintha'alor and take the 1 in the tunnel. If you are a rogue/druid you can easily stealth into the cave with the egg and take the 3or4 out of there using stealth. Then when you go back to Skulk rock the 3 in there should be back and you can repeat and get alot in a very short amount of time. Also these are quite easy to pick up in DM east.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>At some point in the last year they nerfed the respawn rate at Skull rock.&nbsp; Its still probably the easiest way to farm these though.&nbsp; (One exception might be resetting the instance in Maraudon.)<br /><br />The mushrooms spawn in roughly the same 3 places each time.&nbsp; If you get there first, try to pick them 1-2 minutes apart.&nbsp; That way when other people show up you can stake out the area you know they are going to appear next!<br /><br />Area 1 - Near the entrance or up to the right on the &quot;balcony&quot;.&nbsp; The timer respawns every 13-16 minutes on my runs.<br /><br />Area 2 - In or at the entrance of the Pool room below.&nbsp; Every 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />Area 3 - In the little cave at the bottom.&nbsp; Every 12-20 minutes for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />They used to spawn on the path leading down too, but I haven't seen them there is a long while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to add to my previous comment. I started picking the 3 in the cave, then making a run up to Jintha'alor (with an elite mount you can ride all the way up with no fighting). I first head into the cave where sharp beak is (1 there) and then into the egg cave (3 there). By the time I'm done up there, I head back to Skulk rock and they have respawned again. You can get 7 every 20-25mins (if no one else is picking).<br /><br />Hope this helps, dont attempt the second part if your not a level 60 though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Alrighty...<br /><br />I know this info was mentioned below... but seeing as that post was from a long time ago, I thought I should post my info<br /><br />The Coordinates for the entrance of the Skulk Rock cave, if you dont have it on your map is 57,39<br /><br />A total of Three Mushrooms spawn in the Cave at any given time, and once pick, only respawn 1 at a Time every 10 Minutes.... and they spawn in random locations inside the cave<br /><br />The Spawn times did vary every now and then, but on average, it was 10 minutes a shroom.<br /><br />If you are already Endgame level... you could walk through the whole cave untouched with the exception of the Entrace where apparently there is a guardian spawn. A Jade Ooze to be exact. If your not end-game... the mobs are range from level 45-47.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Warlocks would also love to have a lot of these, even if they aren't alchemists. 1. level 60 Warlocks need these to make, either create themselves or have someone create for them, Elixir of Shadow Power which are needed for the Dreadsteed quest.

They're 40g a stack on Scilla, and I'm not spending 50g for a bloody herb.<br /><br />I had no problem summoning my imp and walking around freely, in both the cave and Maraudon. It may seem time consuming, but if you go to the Hinterlands, collect, and go to Maraudon, collect, and repeat, you should have 30 in no time. By no time, I mean a few hours. Heh.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There's a cave on the north side of where you're seeing these &quot;transparent&quot; indications of Ghost Mushroom. Fight the Jade Ooze that inhabit the cave to get to the Ghost Mushroom.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well in some cave it spawns. mostly every 10 mins.<br />The bst cave from my expierience is in hinterland.<br />Whem im at work i place my rogue there and every 10-15 mins i get the 3 in there.<br /><br />Also, there is another cave in Hinterlands, jsut go all south to the elitecastle and there u will find anotehr cave. Also 3 mushrooms in it and respawn every 10 mins.<br /><br />Best herbcashmaker imo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Information: I've farmed the cave in Hinterlands (Skull Rock) and can confirm that the mushrooms have a placeholder called Horde Supply Crate. So loot them too if you want the mushrooms to respawn faster. The Crates seem to have a higher respawn probability than the mushroom</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HonestJack</b></h3>Farming these in Classic? There are two ways, already breifly mentioned in this section, that are superior. I will go a little bit more in-depth so you can start making easy money on your herbalist. One of them is supposed to be combined with fishing and you will need atleast 225.<br /><br />I'm not going to go in to the gold per hour on these farms as it depends so much on supply and demand on each server. But, I can say that on my server both of these farms are easy 30g/h.<br /><br />Enjoy and let me know if I should update or change something to make it better.<br /><br /><b>#1 Maraudon Instance</b><br /><br /><ul><li>Level 60</li><li>Herbalism 245+</li><li>Any class</li></ul><br /><br /><i>There are more superior ways to increase the farm in Maraudon with some classes, but this focus on something all classes can do as long as you have herbalism.</i><br /><br />You start at Orange Side, picking all the nodes outside instance portal first. When you enter you make your way all the way to the Poison Falls and picking the nodes along the way. Be careful at the last corner as you might have to wait for the lasher to move a bit to side before you go by, hugging the wall. Orange Side is the hardest one and might need some practice to get good speed. But keep in mind that at level 60 you can go much closer to the mobs then you might think. All nodes in Orange can be picked.<br /><br />When you come to the Poison Falls it's one tricky node that can be skipped if you want to be safe. If not, this node is on the top ledge of Poison Falls and should be checked before you jump down. It's surrounded by 4 oozes and can only be picked at one spot to not aggro. If you do aggro the pack, you can reset it by going all the way <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12225/celebras-the-cursed">Celebras the Cursed</a>, look for the tree to his left and jump up on the mountain side and stay until you loose combat. The rest of the nodes in Poison Falls are easy. Jump all the way down and run towards Celebras, there are 2-3 nodes along the way.<br /><br />Once Orange and Poison Falls nodes have been picked you make your way to Purple Side. This is much easier. You simply just start make your way to the entrance picking all the nodes. There is one passage that is guarded by 2 Satyrs and 4 Imps that can't be dodged. Here you are supposed to aggro the pack. When you run through, jump straight down and run all the way to the portal, dodge all the patrols and packs and look for where the nodes are. When you go out of the instance, go straight back in and you should be out of combat. Now go back on Purple Wing, pick the nodes and then go back out. Now pick all the nodes outside the instance while you make your way from Purple Entrance to Orange Entrance. Reset the instance when you have reached the Orange Entrance.<br /><br />This run should be about 15:30ish mintues in speed, so it's safe to rinse and repeat as many times as you want. If you find yourself doing it to fast, you can go past Celebras and check for nodes in the start of Green Wing and then go back to Purple Wing.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br /><b>#2 Skulk Rock Fish-o-rama!</b><br /><br /><ul><li>Level 60</li><li>Herbalism 245+</li><li>Fishing 225+</li><li>Any class</li></ul><br /><br />This is by far the easiest way to farm the famous shrooms! <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/maps?data=47:574394">Skulk Rock</a> is a famous farming spot in The Hinterlands and can be very occupied. So this can be a hit or miss. If however the cave is empty, it's a very relaxed and good farm.<br /><br />Make your way to Skulk Rock, if you are Alliance fly to <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8018/guthrum-thunderfist">Guthrum Thunderfist</a> or if Horde fly to <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4314/gorkas">Gorkas</a>. Go inside the cave, first do a full tour of the cave to check for nodes. When all nodes are picked you go to the little puddle and stand with your back against the wall and start fish. From here you can see new nodes spawning while you are catching fish like <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13759/raw-nightfin-snapper">Nightfin Snapper</a> and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13760/raw-sunscale-salmon">Sunscale Salmon</a>. There is a 10ish minutes respawn time on the nodes. So use a bait inbetween and you will have a steady supply of both end game fish and Ghost Mushrooms.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aleflusher</b></h3>If you were forced onto this Classic page and are looking to farm these in BfA, go to Fungal Rock cave in Un'Goro. It's by far the best remaining place to gather these.<br /><br />DO NOT go to the Hinterlands in BfA to farm these, they no longer seem to spawn there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hyperping</b></h3>Best place for <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8845/ghost-mushroom">Ghost Mushroom</a> is Hinterlands. Comparable is Maraudon, but you need to create a group so you can do hobo resets to get yourself back to the beginning of the instance. But this is a little Hinterlands guide. Best if you can stealth and are lvl 60 (Druid in my case).<br /><br /><b>Skulk Rock</b><br />Start here. There are three node clusters, each will randomly pop ONE mushroom every 10-15 min, so one on the upper ring of the cave, and one in each or the two lower cave alcoves. This makes three mushrooms total for the cave at a time. At 60, you can easily slip by the mobs and just grab the mushrooms. This cave can get pretty competitive, so learn to 'own' it - get the timer so it's your cave.<br /><br /><b>Jintha'alor</b><br />Mount up and ride up to the top of Jintha'alor. The mobs along the way may hit you but they can't dismount you. Ignore them. At the top across from the last stairwell is a cave. Run past the two guards and grab the mushroom inside. There is only ever one. Again, 10-15 min timer.<br /><br />Head out of the cave and head to the Elite cave - this is where you need stealth. The elites here will agro, and can be a pain if you get more than one. Sometimes you need to kill one or two in order to get the mushroom they are next to, but most can easily get picked without. Like Skulk Rock, there are 3 herb clusters with several nodes, two in the entry tunnels, one in the back of the cave. So all told, 4 mushrooms atop Jintha'alor. <br /><br />Just like that, you have 7 Ghost Mushroom. Ride like the wind jumping off each tier back to Skulk Rock and repeat. you can build up stacks pretty quickly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maaarf</b></h3>That damned cave in the Hinterlands is all very well if you are level 60, but if you aren't it is somewhat frustrating to have to have to kill your way to the mushroom only to have those level 60 guys log on and run past you to get it while you are fighting,<br />Good old World of Farming, I mean Warcraft, I suppose.</div>
