In the meantime we'll stick with what we have.\n\nHere's a mail I sent to a friend (a troll priest) on the whole thing based on my experiences as a level 29 hunter:\n\nWhy do it?\n\nMainly for the PvP trinket you get at grunt level. You also gain XP � 1200 for every set of 3 WSG marks you hand in. This does not effect your rest bonus. You win 3 marks for a BG win, one mark for a loss. The best rank you can attain at 10-29 is sergeant. Typically you will need 100 HCP (honour contribution points) to be Scout, 3000 to be Grunt and 5000 to be Sergeant. You can check this out at your own realm at \n\n[url=http:\/\/www.wow-europe.com\/pvp\/index.html?r=Hellscream&faction=h#top]http:\/\/www.wow-europe.com\/pvp\/index.html?r=Hellscream&faction;=h#top[\/url]\n\nThe cut off points are exactly accurate indicating that there is a lack of competition at this level � probably down to it being PvE. I would imagine that on a PvP realm you may need more than those amounts principally down to competition. As a side note, with patch 1.12 a lot more people are playing because the BG�s are cross pollinated across the realms. You will notice this as people now have double barrelled names as in name and realm. Also the wait times (to make balanced teams) are reduced as well, so people are playing more often as the lead-times are reduced. Therefore you can expect that the minimum point requirements will be going up. Another complication is the new battleground areas for the factions to fight over in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands.\n\nWhen should I do it?\n\nFrom Wednesday afternoon to Tuesday night. This is because your HCP is calculated on a weekly basis during maintenance. There�s no point in contributing half one week and half the next less the wastage on the first week (honour degrades I think by 20% every week - 10% if you don't PvP - until Burning Crusade). Might as well make one big effort over one week � makes more sense.\n\nWhich BG should I do?\n\nWithout a doubt it�s WSG as the BG can last from 10 minutes to 90 minutes + wait time. AV lasts longer (5 hours + sometimes) but as you kill the same people over and over again the rewards get less and less (if you kill the same person 5 times+ the HCP reward is 50% 10 times+ and it's 0). So you may end up with 100�s of kills and very little reward. WSG = smaller kills but higher HCP per BG.\n\nWhich WSG battle should I join?\n\nI�ve always taken first available but you may be dumped into the middle of a BG (the first time I played it I got created just as an Alliance player was taking a flag � boy was he surprised and dead). Choosing a specific one means the waiting time is longer but you�re in at the start, and that�s when the buffs go in.\n\nWhat tactics do I use?\n\nThis depends on your class obviously, look at it as an instance, so you should always be with a group and at the back looking at for Rogues. In my experience, this hasn�t happened yet, only on one BG did I actually get healed. Most people are too busy �farming� for HCP in kills so it�s every humanoid to themselves. Obviously there is co-operation but this tends to be either helping out if someone is in trouble, or ganging up when you outnumber the opposition.\n\nWhat about the flags then?\n\nIn an ideal world (based on my experiences), you would leave a Hunter, Druid and Mage on our flag while the other 7 attack as a combined unit. You need the defence to be able to delay or kill off alliance flag stealers, but if they are killed off, when they rez they have a good chance of catching up on the flag stealer with their speed buffs. Hunters are particularly good with Hunters Mark + concussion shot + ranged attacks. They can also track humanoids so can tell when people are coming into town. \n\nShamans are best fro flag stealing with a 40% speed buff + healing and slow effects.\n\nYou will always be told when a flag has been picked up, it will tell you in the dialogue box and also on the top screen the alliance (for example if they have taken the horde flag) will have a flashing horde flag beside their own. You also get the flag count there as to how many have been successfully returned to the other base. Once the flag is returned to the other side then either the game is over (3 flags won) or the flags are reset. \n\nBear in mind that the nicked flags must be placed into the same area as your own flag and that there is a number of entrances into each others HQ.\n\n\/battleground for allspeak\n\nWhat should I do if I am in a group with an alliance flag?\n\nStay with the runner (although this may be hard if speed buffed) and concentrate on healing him. If he gets killed you can pick up the flag and run with it yourself (right click on the golden gizmo). Then run and heal like mad.\n\nWhat should I do if I see an alliance with a horde flag?\n\nKill the bastard or at least slow him down and holler for help. If you kill him right click on the flag and this returns it to base.\n\nIs the flag wearer obvious?\n\nYes, the flag has an annoying habit of streaming the relevant colour like a phosphorous flare behind it. Not 100% sure if this is cloaked if a rogue were to vanish, jury still out on that one.\n\nHow do I maximise my honour?\n\nFlag pick ups, returns and recoveries all add to HCP. Being in an area where an enemy is killed gets you HCP even if you are just healing. However, you will probably not get any killing blows which also adds to HCP.\n\nWhich classes do best?\n\nBlizzard will tell you that all are the same. This is crap. Warriors usually always come out on top, rogues do well as do hunters. Shamans, Paladins and druids do ok but are hampered by a lack of DPS and killing blows. Priests suck I would say unless in an organised group. Warlocks and Mages are probably worst as they tend to draw a lot of aggro without having the instance style protection they are accustomed to.\n\nShould I twink and are there zillions of twinkies?\n\nNo and no.\n\nThe rest of the stuff was of a personal opinion on alliance abilities....\n\nSo to recap, Gaining rank and faction is through HCP not just HK. Forget about HK and concetrate on WINNING. If you don't kill anyone and your team still wins you will gain more HCP than if you killed 50 times and lost (which doesn't happen).\n\nAny questions and I'll edit or follow up posts.\n\nNevermind Production EU Hellscream","date":"2006-08-29T05:20:35-05:00","rating":39,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"...the balance of power is very different between level 29 and 60.

It's really best to save all these unless you are twinking.  If you turn in 3 of each BG markers at one time through the quest 'Concerted Efforts' you not only get 150 rep with the AV faction, and 100 rep with AB and WSG.  You also get more honor as well, around 2388.  Of course you will miss out on a bunch of the exp, but you can grind that out any time (and you can grind exp a TON faster with PVE than with PVP).  If you really want to boost your rep fast, hold on to what you have, and turn them in all at once with 'Concerted Efforts'.\n\nConsidering you get some rep with wins, etc. you'll probably be to honored with both the factions (AB and WSG) before you get to the point you want to turn in your symbols(this is discluding AV) so you will have around 33000 rep left to get (12000 rep from honored to revered, and 21000 from revered to exalted).  If you turn in individual symbols it'll take you 660 turn ins of each group of 3 symbols to get to exalted...with all the extra honor you'll get from wins and such you can probably count on having to only actually have to do around 500'ish turn in's.  If you hold them and turn them all in at once, you'll only have to do between 250 and 300 turn in's of each.  By that point you'll also be quite far along in getting some nice PVP ranks, probably around rank 10 or 11, if not higher.  So like I said, you'll benefit yourself greatly if you just hold on to your symbols.  I believe you can only hold a certain number of each symbol at a time (I'm not sure because I never held more than 12 of each at a time when I was doing this) so if you want to use this method you need to rotate the BG you are playing in.  If you aren't twinking, it's also the easiest idea to grind up to 60 as fast as you can, and then start this process up.  You get more honor at 60 as well ;)  If you *are* twinking, this option isn't open to you anyway since you can't play in AV, so you can disregard this :P\n\n^That's all for the hard core players that PVP regularly.  For those of you out there that just want to get exalted with one faction, choose your faction, sign up for that one as often as possible, and just keep pluggin'.  \n\n[i][small]Edited, Jun 26th  2006 at  4:39pm EDT by SofaKingCool[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-06-26T20:34:59-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SofaKingCool","importedSubject":"Hold what you have as long as you can..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":17,"id":3082486,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"where is the guy that gives you the quest to turn them in on the alliance side?

However, note that it will disappear in 24 hours, so clear some space and get it back fast!<br /><br />Marks can be traded in for honour, xp and reputation with the Silverwing Sentinels. The person to hand them in to can be found in capital cities or the portal to Warsong Gulch - either in Ashenvale or the Barrens. The amount of honour and xp gained is dependant on the level.<br /><br />The first time you trade this in, you also obtain some money, but after that only honour and xp is received, as well as reputation.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6984</b></h3>In the patch, the marks will be used along with honour points as a type of 'currency' to buy items.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you want to turn in the mark in Thunder Bluff, then the guy who wants them is in Hunters Rise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>People seem to have a general lack of understanding how BG's work in relation to honour and how the system is geared.<br /><br />All this will change when Burning Crusade comes out and the honour system is completely overhauled. In the meantime we'll stick with what we have.<br /><br />Here's a mail I sent to a friend (a troll priest) on the whole thing based on my experiences as a level 29 hunter:<br /><br />Why do it?<br /><br />Mainly for the PvP trinket you get at grunt level. You also gain XP � 1200 for every set of 3 WSG marks you hand in. This does not effect your rest bonus. You win 3 marks for a BG win, one mark for a loss. The best rank you can attain at 10-29 is sergeant. Typically you will need 100 HCP (honour contribution points) to be Scout, 3000 to be Grunt and 5000 to be Sergeant. You can check this out at your own realm at <br /><br /><a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/pvp/index.html?r=Hellscream&amp;faction=h#top" rel="nofollow">http://www.wow-europe.com/pvp/index.html?r=Hellscream&amp;faction;=h#top</a><br /><br />The cut off points are exactly accurate indicating that there is a lack of competition at this level � probably down to it being PvE. I would imagine that on a PvP realm you may need more than those amounts principally down to competition. As a side note, with patch 1.12 a lot more people are playing because the BG�s are cross pollinated across the realms. You will notice this as people now have double barrelled names as in name and realm. Also the wait times (to make balanced teams) are reduced as well, so people are playing more often as the lead-times are reduced. Therefore you can expect that the minimum point requirements will be going up. Another complication is the new battleground areas for the factions to fight over in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands.<br /><br />When should I do it?<br /><br />From Wednesday afternoon to Tuesday night. This is because your HCP is calculated on a weekly basis during maintenance. There�s no point in contributing half one week and half the next less the wastage on the first week (honour degrades I think by 20% every week - 10% if you don't PvP - until Burning Crusade). Might as well make one big effort over one week � makes more sense.<br /><br />Which BG should I do?<br /><br />Without a doubt it�s WSG as the BG can last from 10 minutes to 90 minutes + wait time. AV lasts longer (5 hours + sometimes) but as you kill the same people over and over again the rewards get less and less (if you kill the same person 5 times+ the HCP reward is 50% 10 times+ and it's 0). So you may end up with 100�s of kills and very little reward. WSG = smaller kills but higher HCP per BG.<br /><br />Which WSG battle should I join?<br /><br />I�ve always taken first available but you may be dumped into the middle of a BG (the first time I played it I got created just as an Alliance player was taking a flag � boy was he surprised and dead). Choosing a specific one means the waiting time is longer but you�re in at the start, and that�s when the buffs go in.<br /><br />What tactics do I use?<br /><br />This depends on your class obviously, look at it as an instance, so you should always be with a group and at the back looking at for Rogues. In my experience, this hasn�t happened yet, only on one BG did I actually get healed. Most people are too busy �farming� for HCP in kills so it�s every humanoid to themselves. Obviously there is co-operation but this tends to be either helping out if someone is in trouble, or ganging up when you outnumber the opposition.<br /><br />What about the flags then?<br /><br />In an ideal world (based on my experiences), you would leave a Hunter, Druid and Mage on our flag while the other 7 attack as a combined unit. You need the defence to be able to delay or kill off alliance flag stealers, but if they are killed off, when they rez they have a good chance of catching up on the flag stealer with their speed buffs. Hunters are particularly good with Hunters Mark + concussion shot + ranged attacks. They can also track humanoids so can tell when people are coming into town. <br /><br />Shamans are best fro flag stealing with a 40% speed buff + healing and slow effects.<br /><br />You will always be told when a flag has been picked up, it will tell you in the dialogue box and also on the top screen the alliance (for example if they have taken the horde flag) will have a flashing horde flag beside their own. You also get the flag count there as to how many have been successfully returned to the other base. Once the flag is returned to the other side then either the game is over (3 flags won) or the flags are reset. <br /><br />Bear in mind that the nicked flags must be placed into the same area as your own flag and that there is a number of entrances into each others HQ.<br /><br />/battleground for allspeak<br /><br />What should I do if I am in a group with an alliance flag?<br /><br />Stay with the runner (although this may be hard if speed buffed) and concentrate on healing him. If he gets killed you can pick up the flag and run with it yourself (right click on the golden gizmo). Then run and heal like mad.<br /><br />What should I do if I see an alliance with a horde flag?<br /><br />Kill the bastard or at least slow him down and holler for help. If you kill him right click on the flag and this returns it to base.<br /><br />Is the flag wearer obvious?<br /><br />Yes, the flag has an annoying habit of streaming the relevant colour like a phosphorous flare behind it. Not 100% sure if this is cloaked if a rogue were to vanish, jury still out on that one.<br /><br />How do I maximise my honour?<br /><br />Flag pick ups, returns and recoveries all add to HCP. Being in an area where an enemy is killed gets you HCP even if you are just healing. However, you will probably not get any killing blows which also adds to HCP.<br /><br />Which classes do best?<br /><br />Blizzard will tell you that all are the same. This is crap. Warriors usually always come out on top, rogues do well as do hunters. Shamans, Paladins and druids do ok but are hampered by a lack of DPS and killing blows. Priests suck I would say unless in an organised group. Warlocks and Mages are probably worst as they tend to draw a lot of aggro without having the instance style protection they are accustomed to.<br /><br />Should I twink and are there zillions of twinkies?<br /><br />No and no.<br /><br />The rest of the stuff was of a personal opinion on alliance abilities....<br /><br />So to recap, Gaining rank and faction is through HCP not just HK. Forget about HK and concetrate on WINNING. If you don't kill anyone and your team still wins you will gain more HCP than if you killed 50 times and lost (which doesn't happen).<br /><br />Any questions and I'll edit or follow up posts.<br /><br />Nevermind Production EU Hellscream</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What to do with them now?<br /><br />I understand that these tokens are now used as special money instead of rep / xp, but whereTF do you go to turn `em in / see the available items?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have 100 AB marks now.&nbsp; When I continue to participate in raids, afterwards (when we win), I receive no marks, but I get a mail from the battlemaster.&nbsp; It is a message that says that I cannot carry any more marks, and has 3 marks attached.&nbsp; I can save the mail, but for only 24 hours.<br /><br />I do not want to buy anything because I am trying to save up my honor points.&nbsp; Not really sure how this works, but doesn't the special items cost you honor and marks?&nbsp; ... or just qualifying by having enough honor for an item allows you to purchase it and no actual honor points are deducted from your character?&nbsp; Some of those items require a ton of honor points.<br /><br />So, if I don't want to use my marks via making purchases(everything you buy is solebound and you cannot sell to vendors), how do I get rid of the marks?...is it just a matter of destroying them?...seems rediculous:( .....or..just forget the whole BG thing!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These are now stackable in stacks of 100 per stack. This is a change from before the BC came out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you are Alliance, you can hand in your WSG Marks of Honor (and honor points) to Illiyana Moonblaze at <b>Silverwing Grove</b> in <b>Ashenvale</b> for fabulous prizes - (different names, same stats as Horde WSG gear I think).<br /><br /><b>Silverwing Grove</b> - coords - 61,85 in <b>Ashenvale</b>.<br /><br />There's also an entrance to WSG there.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>at level 10-19, turning in 3 of these was giving me 750 experience. at lvl 20-29, i got 1200 xp. at 30-39 the xp for 3 is 1500. it doesn't matter what level you were when you earned them, but only what level you are when you turn them in. does anyone know the xp reward for turn-ins at each bracket level?<br /><br />once you have 20 of these(inventory and bank combined), you can't carry any more. when you complete a wsg, if the token reward would give more then 20, they go to your mailbox instead. they are on a short timer (only 24 hours) in your mailbox before they disappear. you can't get them out of your mailbox until you turn in some of the ones you already have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you not always get 2250 exp ;) For now I get 1500 exp (35lvl druid)<br />about rep. yes, I agree<br />but I didn;t know that you're getting honor points for this! O_o<br /><br />Edited, Fri Apr 21 18:41:17 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can someone put the areas and ncp locations to turn these in?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, Silliun was almost completely correct ;) 55 rep for humans, but only 50 rep for everyone else (it was a good post none the less). It's really best to save all these unless you are twinking. If you turn in 3 of each BG markers at one time through the quest 'Concerted Efforts' you not only get 150 rep with the AV faction, and 100 rep with AB and WSG. You also get more honor as well, around 2388. Of course you will miss out on a bunch of the exp, but you can grind that out any time (and you can grind exp a TON faster with PVE than with PVP). If you really want to boost your rep fast, hold on to what you have, and turn them in all at once with 'Concerted Efforts'.<br /><br />Considering you get some rep with wins, etc. you'll probably be to honored with both the factions (AB and WSG) before you get to the point you want to turn in your symbols(this is discluding AV) so you will have around 33000 rep left to get (12000 rep from honored to revered, and 21000 from revered to exalted). If you turn in individual symbols it'll take you 660 turn ins of each group of 3 symbols to get to exalted...with all the extra honor you'll get from wins and such you can probably count on having to only actually have to do around 500'ish turn in's. If you hold them and turn them all in at once, you'll only have to do between 250 and 300 turn in's of each. By that point you'll also be quite far along in getting some nice PVP ranks, probably around rank 10 or 11, if not higher. So like I said, you'll benefit yourself greatly if you just hold on to your symbols. I believe you can only hold a certain number of each symbol at a time (I'm not sure because I never held more than 12 of each at a time when I was doing this) so if you want to use this method you need to rotate the BG you are playing in. If you aren't twinking, it's also the easiest idea to grind up to 60 as fast as you can, and then start this process up. You get more honor at 60 as well ;) If you *are* twinking, this option isn't open to you anyway since you can't play in AV, so you can disregard this :P<br /><br />^That's all for the hard core players that PVP regularly. For those of you out there that just want to get exalted with one faction, choose your faction, sign up for that one as often as possible, and just keep pluggin'. <br /><br /><i>Edited, Jun 26th 2006 at 4:39pm EDT by SofaKingCool</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>where is the guy that gives you the quest to turn them in on the alliance side? I can't find him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Maybe stupid to post this, but if you hand 3 of them in you get 2250 exp, 55 reputation with silverwing and 228 honor points</div>
