<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as a rogue, i think i would choose the armor/defence trinket. 40dmg is a good add, but i would last veeeeeeeery long in pvp if activated the armor/defence trinket. jsut my opinion, all should choose what they want. (if i ever take down hakkar:/)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Are you really that short-sighted?<br /><br />We have both PVE and PVP spec players in our guild and in terms of end game raids the PVP players perform and contribute just as well. You're rediculous assertion that what you say is factual is in fact flippant and lacks knowledge understanding of the dynamics of teamplay within a good guild.<br /><br />Yes, I agree with the other guy too, PVP/PVE oriented players are not dissimilar in terms of what they input into their raid runs and no it doesn't disservice the guild because the gear they earn through DKP is complimentary and will still benefit the guild.<br /><br />Rethink your attitude and stop using stupid statements like &quot;Their the facts...&quot; because what came out of your mouth was simply rubbish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First, yes. Did this for my paladin Saturday. Hakkar buff is entire stv zone, 2hrs, lasts through death, far better than ony buff. Next trinkets. I have seen much speculation on gear in this game and prevailing thought is items should go to those they benifit most. That said; except for mele dps trinket, both the tanking and healiing trinkets benifit hybrid classes much more than a pure class: rough example, healing trinket would benifit my priest with perhaps 10% increase in dps/healing where as it benifits my paladin more like 30%. Despite what others are saying here, the hybrid classes such as paly/shamman/druid benifit more from both the tanking trinket and the healing trinket more than a pure class will.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stupid question, but i want to know. I was wondering if someone could loot the head more than once, like getting the ZHC then after awhile looting the head to get ZHB. Yes, no?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I would say yeah, a mage/lock would benefit more then a rogue from getting the beneficial trinkets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone wants these trinkets. 'Nough said? They appeal to everyone and therefore gives every guild a reason to kill Hakkar for more then the glory of killing him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Meh, in my opinion the only marginally useful one (as in useful for what it was intended and WHO it was intended) is the tanking one.. But honestly, if I was a tank, I would other trinkets that conferred a more regular bonus.. But tanks always need things like that.. They can definitely come in handy<br /><br />Anyways, I am a rogue, so I would get the defense one, for the aforementioned reason.. I get targeted (and subsequently raped) by warriors in PvP/BG's.. So, this would be a nice trinket for me to shut down a warriors offense on me long enough for me to get a few nice crits for over 2000 :D <br /><br />/wave<br />/cheer PWNAGE</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My guild downed Hakkar last night and the heart dropped. The caster trinket is pretty cool, but I, as a mage, wasn't interested in it because it is clearly better for a healing class. The +dmg is very nice, but it does twice as much +healing which would be wasted on anyone who can't heal. I wouldn't deprive a druid or a priest from having this considering those extra heals could make the difference between a wipe and a dead boss. If it had the generic spell boost without the greater heal aspect, maybe I'd have changed my mind.</div>
