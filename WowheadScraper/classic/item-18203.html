It procs about once every 40 hits for me acccording to procwatch.  It stacks with flurry, enrage, crusader ....everything.  I was out fighting ogres in the BS the other day just for fun, I got crusader, enrage, flurry, ER, deathwish and my darkmoon card to all fire off within one second...my dps hit 648...whee...this thing is a ton of fun.  Plus it's a big furry paw!\n\nWanted to update on this.  Running with some guildies through ubrs I was able to get the dal'rends I was missing.  Just as an experiment I shelved the paw in ZG and much to my surprise my dmg went up signifigantly.  I'm sure it's a combination of things:  the extra +1% crit the 50 AP set bonus and the +5 racials for swords.  I don't even have any enchants on the dal'rends set; this is opposed to crusader on the paw.  \n\nFor analysis, I went to WS to work on my mount rep for a whle and tried with both.  With the paw main hand (with crusader) and dal's off hand..i was averaging about 217 dps over all fights this was about 30 mins of actual combat time.  Switching to the dal's main hand(no enchants) i jumped to 252 avg dps.  No buffs here except Battle Shout.  \n\nAnother thing to watch with the paw , given the attack speed (base and buff), if you are a fury warrior do -not- use HS to dump rage.  You -WILL- pull aggro and get smashed if you healers aren't on their toes.\n\nJust my experiences.\n\nEdited, Mon Feb 13 10:36:32 2006","date":"2006-02-08T17:07:11-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"jonasxtx","importedSubject":"This does stack with pretty much everything"},{"commentv2":1,"number":75,"id":3063489,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Does anyone have a screenshot on the proc summon?

A large part of your damage is dependant on sinister strikes as fist weapon\/sword rogue. The sinister strikes with this very low dmgrange weapon will be very tiny (even since AP nerf) and I don't think you can catch that up with the special of this weapon. \"Yeah but S&D+the proc = madness!\" so? You can still use S&D on other weapons and get way fatter sinister strikes. No matter how fast your weapon is, your sinister strikes will still cost 40 energy and your energy regeneration is still as fast as with a slow weapon, difference is your sinister strikes will be tiny with this one. Another disadvantage of the low dmg range is that classes with a shield will block more percent of the dmg of a hit.\n\nIn my opinion mainly combat specced rogues are better off with a high dmgrange mainhand for the above reasons. Why else do you think the high warlords weapons (swords\/daggers\/fist weapons) are so damn slow (2.0speed dagger, 2.90 speed sword\/fist\/maces), it's just drool for the fattest sinister strikes\/backstabs and these rogues will outDPS any other rogue (or even class) if they know what they're doing.\n\nEdited, Sun Feb 19 21:36:49 2006","date":"2006-02-20T04:24:53-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Skippert","importedSubject":"Rogue weapon"},{"commentv2":1,"number":94,"id":3063508,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"If a hunter got the complete set, because of the pet, would the spirit be summoned, or can you only have one pet at a time.","date":"2005-04-25T01:15:44-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"YellowJots","importedSubject":"Good for Hunter?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":95,"id":3063509,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"The whole design of this thing makes me soooo sad that it isnt worth much for a druid - claws, beast helm, summon animal?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5487</b></h3>Very nice for tanking, but for any DPS wise builds, not the best. Rogue's need a slower weapon for a SS or Hemo build, fury warriors need a slower weapon for their instant attacks, and shamans need slower weapon for WF proc.<br />The model for this thing looks hilarious, especially when you have the offhand too, you can go around talking about how you're a teddy bear fisting people in the face. Great times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wildarms1</b></h3>This is horrible for a main hand. the speed lowers it's damage like no tomorrow. any rogue or dw fury warrior wanting this should stop. 48 dps seems high for this but the damage doesn't make up for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Skills like slam, cleave, and all the other skills that do Wep Dmg+ are useless for a dual wield fury warrior.<br /><br />Heroic strike is a &quot;next melee attack skill&quot; meaning the faster you hit, the more rage you gain, and the faster your heroic strike will hit the target, therefore increasing DPS.<br /><br />people say &quot;warriors damage suck&quot;, then I suggest you to look at this screenshot.&nbsp; It is my level 42 Warrior w/ mainly Green armor equiped.&nbsp; My battle shout/str/crit % is about half of what it will be endgame.&nbsp; My mainhand and offhand weapons are Mug'O Hurt (31.2 DPS &amp; 1.7 Speed).&nbsp; With enrage kicked in (last 12 seconds, must be crit striked..happens alot in PK), Flurry (30% IAS for next 3 swings), Rend's BUFF (15% IAS, half of what the proc on This Claw) and 2 +8 Sharpening Stones my dmg is...<br /><br /><a href="http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a167/omnisoulz/fury.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a167/omnisoulz/fury.jpg</a><br /><br />So how does this set benefit a full fury spec warrior?&nbsp; can we say DPS, Procs, Crit, and more DPS?<br /><br />The fact is, this is THE BEST set for a fury speced warrior.&nbsp; Combined with super fast speed, high dps, and amazing proc (30% ias for 5 seconds is like 12-15 swings BTW) bringing the total to almost 60% sustained IAS (.9 weapon speed) then procs like lifesteal/crusader and then enrage and I could almost bet a fully decked out warrior could sustain 300+ total DPS EASY.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, a warrior with this set, w/ enrage, 5 sec speed proc, and flurry activated would prob reach 400DPS mainhand and 300ish offhand ;)<br /><br />2nd choice would be a combat rouge, 3rd a hunter for &quot;looks imo&quot; and finally 4th anyone who cannot dual wield who just wants a better weapon then they currentaly have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just snagged this fist in MC today, surprisingly no one else wanted it, so I figured I'd grab it for tanking.&nbsp; If nothing else the lighting fast speed will be nice for spamming Heroic Strike and the DPS is still better than any blue one-hander.<br /><br />I play tested it with procwatch, and after 1000 hits, it procs about once out of every 35 hits, or once a minute.&nbsp; Not too bad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the proc does in fact stack with a fury warriors flurry ability...how do i know this? well i'm a fury warrior...<br /><br />when it procs at the same time as flurry *which is quite often, considering i have flurry up 100% of the time, due to my roughly 20% crit rate and my fast attack speed, and flurry being able to reproc itself mid countdown*...it comes to an attack speed of roughly .85 ... so YES you can attack at faster than 1.0 attack speed because i do it quite often...its very nice actually</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This wep with its 30% attack speed proc and flurry and if you are a troll zerker would rape in pvp.. just think of all the windfurys you will get with attack speed less than 1 second. Just a note that this is a kickass weap. great for warriors and rogues too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>True they do not stack like that, but they do stack. The rumor of a 40% cap to attack speed bonuses is 100% false.<br /><br />Warlords buff+eskhandar proc+snd+bladeflurry put my attack speed for two 1.5 weapons to .55 and I did 4500 pts damage in about 4 seconds.<br /><br />It doesnt happen every time obviously... and warlords doesnt happen every day, but with poison procs and 4-5 attacks per second and a 30% crit rate you can seriously stomp pve azz with it.<br /><br />PVP..... you might get lucky with a proc or lend some good support but a good 80% of the time 1 on 1 you are at a severe disadvantage due to the fact that you cannot lock with gouge and must remain near your target at all times as burst is fairly crappy with this weapon.<br /><br />A while back I used poisons potions and had a feral druid grouped with me with leader of the pack and had a 37.5 crit rate with no mc gear... my hp were very low but hey... things died so fast farming it really didn't matter. I was duo'n with the druid, rogue tanking the elite bugs in silithis and things went fast.<br /><br />the +4 weapon damage ring from battlegear is super with this weapon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Another viable option which im gonna try out with the free respec from 1.12 is all + to damage.<br /><br />According to the formula with +8 from a dense weight stone, +5 from enchant and +4 from weapon damage ring eskhandars should go from 50-94 to 67-111. 67+111/2/1.5 = 59.3dps weapon<br /><br />Using the same formula dal'rends main hand is - 47.5 dps<br /><br />With the right setup you should be able to beat dal rends set with this weapon. And this is not including the proc and the fact that faster weaponspeed bonuses will contribute to this weapon more than rends.<br /><br />And it also does not take into the fact that the time between main hand swings from a dalrend could prove critical in putting a mob down before someone eats it. With eskhandar that problem is less as you are swinging 2-3 times faster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this proc stacks with SnD <br /><br />a good way to use fist wepons is to put points into imp instant poision, and imp poision damage<br /><br />i use lifestealing on the pair of them, and i keep a slice n dice up at all times, the damage may be weak, but if you can get a good crit line off they do a $%^&amp; load of damage, and if you have instant poision on both, from my experence it beats out my old dps (combat swords) by a long shot<br /><br />just my 2 cents, i think its a good idea for a rogue to pick this up if they can aford to keep allot of poisions!</div>

I have both claws, so i got on test server and was messing around. Deadly poision fully stacks in no time.. but Instant poision is ideal, just every other regular hit with slice n dice applys the poision.<br /><br />So as long as the mob your fighting isn't immune to poision the instant poision damage makes up for the lower ss dmg.<br /><br />All in all, its a decent set but I wouldn't change my actual char around for this set.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>IMO this weapon is one of the best one-handers for dual-wielding Shaman. The weapon proc + Flurry (talent) + Windfury will essentially give you a almost constant haste effect, and you will be very likely to proc Unleashed Rage faster than it takes for the buff to expire. The model on my Tauren Shaman often can't keep up with how fast I'm swinging (Julie's Dagger in the offhand). Several warriors in my guild also report that it's one of the best weapons for tanking Vael.</div>

I promptly wasted DKP against the other MT warrior, and went back to town to respec even more into protection and put points into Deflection after I had won.<br /><br />Turns out, you CANNOT Parry with this weapon because it is a fist weapon (unarmed skill, and it can even be disarmed). This means that for myself, I lose 16% DAMAGE MITIGATION by equipping this weapon, for a measely 5dps gain over Iceblade Hacker or the aggro ability of the Flurry Axe. Thats right, add:<br />Equip: -16% Parry<br />to the bottom of this weapon. Who in their right mind would wear something like that? Why would there be a downside to obtaining an uber purple 48dps weapon from Magmadar? Because Blizzard is brain dead. Worthless for rogues, worthless for warriors, worthless for hunters. You can't even DUAL WIELD to get your Parry % back. With this in your hand, you take 16% more damage, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.<br /><br />Beautiful.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. I'm a fury spec warrior and have been watching it's proc rate with procwatch. The great thing about this is it's on &quot;chance on hit:&quot; meaning faster you hit the better. It procs about once every 40 hits for me acccording to procwatch. It stacks with flurry, enrage, crusader ....everything. I was out fighting ogres in the BS the other day just for fun, I got crusader, enrage, flurry, ER, deathwish and my darkmoon card to all fire off within one second...my dps hit 648...whee...this thing is a ton of fun. Plus it's a big furry paw!<br /><br />Wanted to update on this. Running with some guildies through ubrs I was able to get the dal'rends I was missing. Just as an experiment I shelved the paw in ZG and much to my surprise my dmg went up signifigantly. I'm sure it's a combination of things: the extra +1% crit the 50 AP set bonus and the +5 racials for swords. I don't even have any enchants on the dal'rends set; this is opposed to crusader on the paw. <br /><br />For analysis, I went to WS to work on my mount rep for a whle and tried with both. With the paw main hand (with crusader) and dal's off hand..i was averaging about 217 dps over all fights this was about 30 mins of actual combat time. Switching to the dal's main hand(no enchants) i jumped to 252 avg dps. No buffs here except Battle Shout. <br /><br />Another thing to watch with the paw , given the attack speed (base and buff), if you are a fury warrior do -not- use HS to dump rage. You -WILL- pull aggro and get smashed if you healers aren't on their toes.<br /><br />Just my experiences.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Feb 13 10:36:32 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok to all you rogues out there... don't eat my head off for rolling on this, but it IS in fact a very nice weapon for hunters. If you look at it, the claws are the perfect thing for transferring from melee to ranged... one SLOWS the target and allows the hunter to regain his ranged advantage, and the +attack speed affects both ranged and melee attacks, so wing clip + that proc is VERY nice for hunters. And while the other pieces do add stam and +%chance to crit, mainly recognized as good for rogues, hunters need these buffs about just as much. And when you add in the fact that fist weapons are kinda shabby for rogues... it just works.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes this weapon procs ALOT and yes i have had this weapon proc from range soloing Sm with runners :) this is a very fast weapon and is fun to use</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this off Magmadar a while ago, and it is the perfect shaman one-hander. The weapon proc, crusader proc, flurry, and windfury all stack -- putting out insane DPS. Anyone that says this isn't a shaman weapon is wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Confirmed, it stacks with flurry 0.89 attack speed main hand, off hand (bonescraper) getting 0.83 speed. <br />DPS is so high it's not displayed for main hand (estimate 220.8 to 244.4 DPS), 120.1 to 134.0 DPS off hand!<br /><br />Battle Shout, Flurry, Eskhandar Rage Proc, Crusader Proc.<br /><a href="http://static.zoovy.com/img/ddeatsrag/-/1/eskhandar.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://static.zoovy.com/img/ddeatsrag/-/1/eskhandar.jpg</a><br /><br />Battle Shout, Flurry, Eskhandar Rage Proc, Double Crusader Proc (stacks too).<br /><a href="http://static.zoovy.com/img/ddeatsrag/-/1/eskhandar2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://static.zoovy.com/img/ddeatsrag/-/1/eskhandar2.jpg</a><br /><br />Edited, Sun Jan 8 03:23:55 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've had it for quite some time now. In my current full DPS gear (right claw+amulet, 4/8NS etc) I have a 33% chance to crit unbuffed and the real crit rate should be around 35% (at least according to ctmods DPS counter... add +2 maybe 3% to that with buffs, and another extra 2% with mongoose). My best SS crit with it was a nice 777 dam, the average crit is in the 460-650 range(again fully buffed). The 30% increased attack speed procs fairly often on it, though it seems to me that when I'm in an instance it doesn't happen nearly as many times as I'd like. I don't use SnD with it its just a waste of combo points that can be spent in evis or rupture. The overall dam output is insane though... I can over damage a few dagger and sword specced rogues in my guild who do some slick dmage too... I've been thinking about getting the Claw of the black drake, but I think that its slow speed makes it a bad trade compared to this one. My only problem with eskhandar is that the bloody left claw and the cape drop from world bosses to whom you can almost never get... Blizzz should realy think something up because this way 2 guilds on my server make it impossible for others to even go near them.<br />I'd like to have a few checkups on the crit rate it somehow I feels that something is still not working properly and I get a lot less crits than I should with the fist spec...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this yesterday but I'm a little torn on which enchant I should choose. Because of it's speed +5dmg would be useful, but I don't know if it's more useful than crusader.<br /><br />+5dmg main and crusader off?<br /><br />Fury Warrior</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Claws: Too fast for SS, but not daggers so you can't Amb/BS with them. Offhand ones are cool though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This set is a sick set for any class that can use claws. Its godlike for hunters cause the complete set has a on critical strike summon spirit of eskander and mind you that works both with melee and ranged so in other woulds multishoting and this thing will never go away unless im standing in IF i crit every multishot. Plus the pet has the skill expose weakness which for those who dont know is also on the dragonstalker complete set for those who wonder what that skill does it addes 450 damage to any ranged attack made on the target from any person. <br /><br />As for rogues and warriors #$%^ yes this is good for both if they are spec'd for it the set is useable with all epic and rare sets so that makes it great right there. <br /><br />Personally as a hunter this is the best weapon set up i could have fast for wing clips + to crits which of course already means super ranged damage. I would pair it with Dragonstalkers set and the Epic Bow or even a Hurricane or Precisely Calibrated Boomstick for faster ranged attack.<br /><br />Rogues now need a hella tight dagger set like this if they had that they would wipe thier @55 with this set.<br /><br />As for fury warriors they need a beefed up Flurry axe something with sick damage and still multi hits so that the rage bar just keeps filling and filling at crazy speed double flurry axes and my fury warrior never loses rage bar its awesome but they need more damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The only thing that really makes me angry about this set, is the fact, that the weapons have clipping on female nightelves(the hands are looking out of the weapon).<br />And who knows if they ever will be fixed...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have this weapon, together with collar. No luck with the rest of the set yet tho.<br /><br />Quite a decent weapon for everyone who doesn't rely on slow weapons. I have crusader enchanted on it, pretty similar procrate. Both, Haste and Crusader go off at least once every fight. Not to mention how damn high dps jumps, if both effects come at the same time :)<br />The haste is very short duration tho. But its kinda fun to smack casters with it. I guess, flurry would be really insane with this baby.<br /><br />One thing you might like to know about, parry talents don't work on claw weapons yet. A GM told me that this is a known issue, and probably goin to be fixed in 1.7 if it ever goes live.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The spirit proc... on the RARE occasion that it does proc... is actually great for hunters, too - it can hold aggro off of the hunter while adding some nice expendable melee damage into any instance run.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I love this weapon as a druid it may not proc in cat form or bear form it is a nice fast weapon. Does a good amount of DPS and the good part is that I can use an offhand item with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Edited, Fri Jan 27 17:27:00 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I wonder why any not-poison specced rogue (most rogues I know are not poison specced) would want this weapon. A large part of your damage is dependant on sinister strikes as fist weapon/sword rogue. The sinister strikes with this very low dmgrange weapon will be very tiny (even since AP nerf) and I don't think you can catch that up with the special of this weapon. &quot;Yeah but S&amp;D+the proc = madness!&quot; so? You can still use S&amp;D on other weapons and get way fatter sinister strikes. No matter how fast your weapon is, your sinister strikes will still cost 40 energy and your energy regeneration is still as fast as with a slow weapon, difference is your sinister strikes will be tiny with this one. Another disadvantage of the low dmg range is that classes with a shield will block more percent of the dmg of a hit.<br /><br />In my opinion mainly combat specced rogues are better off with a high dmgrange mainhand for the above reasons. Why else do you think the high warlords weapons (swords/daggers/fist weapons) are so damn slow (2.0speed dagger, 2.90 speed sword/fist/maces), it's just drool for the fattest sinister strikes/backstabs and these rogues will outDPS any other rogue (or even class) if they know what they're doing.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Feb 19 21:36:49 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If a hunter got the complete set, because of the pet, would the spirit be summoned, or can you only have one pet at a time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The whole design of this thing makes me soooo sad that it isnt worth much for a druid - claws, beast helm, summon animal? Come oooon!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>does this proc work i druids bear and cat forms?<br /><br />Edited, Wed Mar 15 01:43:45 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got the main hand today I am a combat spec rogue. When I get the offhand I will go fist weapon spec/pvp and have around 33 crit chance. Poisons yes eviscerate damage seems to have stayed the same. SS isn't everything. Blade Flurry Imp Slice and dice with that proc'n would be 80% increased attack</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The proc on this weapon is very weak. It procs on average of less than once a minute, nearer 2 minutes, while in combat. This adds maybe 1% to dps. Its the lowest proc rate I have seen on any weapon or enchant so far. I used an addon to monitor its proc rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a shaman! I have it and i love it! It procks all the time with windfury, and because of that weapon's flurry procs a lot as well! Muhahahaha</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This would be cool at a Tauren hunter</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ive had the pair and the neck for about 6 months now, pelt never dropped. Played with them for a couple of weeks but then went back to cookie.<br /><br />but since the 1.9 nerf to warriors 2h ability i decided to go fury again.<br /><br />On Nefarian phase 1 ive experimented with different combos of weapons, these, vis'kag and bloodlords, and all i can say is that the pair of these destroys any other setup ive tried. I think the only thing better would be CHT and Thunderfury, gief legendary drops plz</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got these and i planned to use it for tanking - then a few hours later Azuregos spawns and guess what dropped? The other claw!<br />/cheer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this yesterday;)Duel wielding this with an axe from Duke.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Enina</b></h3>This doesn't have any internal cooldown (as with basically all procs in Vanilla). Though I never completed the set, I used this for OTing for my raids, and ripped aggro on Vaelstrasz easily due to Flurry + the claw proc. With the infinite rage from Essence of the Red during the fight, and the insane attack speed from procs, it was a death sentence waiting to happen, and I had to actually DPS with Cleave... lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rorken</b></h3>This does stack with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12974/flurry">Flurry</a> in Classic. With either buff active, this item's attack speed goes from 1.50 to 1.15; with both active it goes to 0.89.</div>
