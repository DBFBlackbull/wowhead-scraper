<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have waited on the vendor on the horde side for 4 days now and 2 server reboots.. it never shows up. <br /><br />I am wondering if blizzard stopped the drop of this item due to it being very easy to reach 280-300 with this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As someone already said, the npcs that sell limited supply items often only sell one or two at a time. If you want something else that they're offering at the time, you'd be best off by buying what he's offering now to clear for the specific pattern of your choise to be for sale. Once you've done it, leave and do something else for half an hour, then check back. Sooner or later you'll get it. <br /><br />Took me 4 trips to Swamp of Sorrows to buy the Elixir of Demonslaying recipe, and had to buy some mana potions (on my rogue -_-) to get it.. same principle should apply here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This one is definitely hard to get.. Read the post's in here and found mr. Werg Thickblade.. Camped right next to him for 2 hours, bought 3 of the elementals shouldes, since one posts suggested that might trikker the other to appear (it doesn't) finally gave up when the 4th elemental recipe turned up and went to do questing.. Got back 2 hours later on my way to Western Plagueland's and bang, there they were.. <br /><br />Worth the wait though, with this recipe you can easily get from 260-280 in no time at all..</div>
