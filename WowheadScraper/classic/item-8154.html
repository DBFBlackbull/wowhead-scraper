<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i grinded the beasts of tanaris for a few levels for exp and leather. your best bet is to farm thick leather (from hyenas/basilisks) and pick up the scorps along the way. there is no 100% efficient way but if you spend enough time grinding/farming youll get tons of scales. youll also get plenty of vendor trash so you can earn some cash in the process.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In about half a level of grinding I got the required scales for dragonscale leatherworking quest. (requires 40) plus a few bracers and I still have scales left over. SW of the goblin town in Tanaris there is a huge sand dune with massive piles of bones on it. Around the eastern slope of the dune are scorpid tail lashers (42-44). There is enough here that I can fight them non stop until my inventory fills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Also, they often drop these scorpid things, vendor trash, but a stack sells to the vendor for 88s, almost a 1g. And they drop these alot, so combine with farming the other beasts for thick leather, and this should be pretty easy.<br /><br />Just farmed 30 pieces in forty minutes (maybe even less). Auctioneer tells me it should go for around 15g. So not bad IMO :)<br /><br />I'm lvl 52, boosting my LW, so grinding these is pretty easy, but as rogue, the higher ones cast an annoying 40 sec poison, but they're also the ones with the best droprate!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Best way to get them (level 50+) is to go and kill dunestalkers in tanaris southern parts, they mosttly drop 2 at time and pretty often. had to get 40 myself :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Scorpid Dunestalkers are a better way to farm the scales. Much higher drop rate than scorpid hunters, sometimes you'll even get 2 scales instead of one. These are common near the Dunemaul Compound in Tanaris.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>it really sucks gettin all the scales for dragonlw i need 38 effin scales for it. and since staghelm is a new server i can only get them in small quantities. they are kinda hard to find and it sucks farmin but u can defanetly get a lot of gold off of leatherworkers.for scorpid armor and also the dragon lw quest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>U want scorpid scales well I know how! If you want the scales u have to be a true dedicated leatherworker. That means u need to be a skinner... not some other proffesion. You just kill the scorpids and skin them. But be careful you have to go out to find scorpids and u could be attacked by more then 1 creature. Questions? ask me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I wish Allakhazam would fix this. Near as I can figure it seems people use &quot;free&quot; wow servers that have been altered in some way and rats drop anything and everything. People using the wowreader on these servers give false information to the site</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just done a farm run at Tanaris &amp; be carefull as the hyenas and rocs and basilisks tend to aggro on mass !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These go for quite a lot of money on my server, they are used for the leatherwork specialisation for dragon leather. At least 40 of theese are need to complete the dragon quest. <br /><br />So sell theese at your local AH - cheap =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Scorpid scales are in high demand at the AH, never any for sale though. <br /><br />These are used for Dragonscale Leather working (I'm sure other stuff too) and by that time the Hunter/Shaman may give up some gold to just purchase it and get it over with.<br /><br />Farm these and make some good gold selling them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Best drop is Dunestalkers in Tanaris (46-49)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These are not junk, they are actually used for leatherworking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>not sure if they've improved drop rates since some of the previous posts were made here, but basically all i do to collect my scales is this.<br />in tanaris, starting from Gadgetzan, i usually head south making a straight path towards the northern most of the two ruins (with Dunemaul Ogres present). along the way there will be quite a variety of mobs to kill/skin, scorpids included. also, the stretch between the two ruins, and the actual Compound (with the cave)is a pretty good spawning ground for the higher level scorpids.<br /><br />in all honesty i've seen either type drop 1-2 scales per skin, as well as a chance for thick and heavy leather (obviously not all in one skinning).<br />neither type is going to give you scales every time, but i found the rate isn't that bad. what makes this a pain in the ass - if at all - is just tracking down and killing the little buggers, as they are quite spread out and don't really travel in packs or have any one spot where they mass-spawn.<br /><br />all in all, at 48 (rogue) one broad circular sweep following the path i talked about above and i usually bring in about 15-25 scales on average.<br /><br />**note**<br />scorpids in blasted lands have quite a nice drop rate, only you won't find that many and they are swarmed with mobs and unless you're 50+ it's gonna be a slight pain with all the aggro's and add's coming out to play! :)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Apr 21st 2007 9:48pm by Gajita</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found a good many Scorpid Hunters NE of Gadget in the hills. There are a few other types of creatures mixed in, but primarily Scorpid Hunters. My current Coordinates are 56, 26 as I stand in the middle of a few of them.<br /><br />~Yeckly</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been killing the scorpid hunters to get my 40 scales. And while this is pure speculation, it seems like the hyenas and basilisks in the area can be PH's for them. If you go along an area and kill everything, it seems you'll find more scorpids your 2nd time through. I tried to focus on the scorpids and hyenas, since the hyenas drop red wolf meat, tender wolf meat, and mystery meat. Good stuff for cooking. I'm still a little low for the dunestalkers, but I found the hunters a pretty good route to go if your willing to put some time into it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Go Tanaris! Besides getting Turtles, you can also get the scorpid scales. though the dunestalkers tend to drop more scales, they are fewer and harder to come by. with the respawn rate close to Gadgetzan, it's possible to collect many scales in a short period of time. You will get aggroed on by hyenas and rocs and basilisks. the Giant eggs are part of the artisan cooking qst, hold onto them, people will need them. the skins from the others provide you with excellent mats for making scorpid mail. This is a great present to hunters and if you can advertise a complete set at once, it's golden!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LetoA52</b></h3>For those playing Classic, Tanaris is your best bet. The scorpids in Uld seem to have a pretty low drop rate, and the ones in the Blasted Lands are not numerous enough and are heavily farmed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jfoobar</b></h3>At least according to Wowhead, all three Tanaris scorpid species (scorpid hunters , scorpid tail lashers , and scorpid dunestalkers ) have the same skinning droprate for these scales. In my anecdotal experience, tail lashers have a lower rate but that might just be bad RNG on my part. That said, the advantage to the dunestalkers is about half the time they drop them, they drop 2 of them. <br /><br />The Wowhead map for dunestalkers is way off. They are populated across the entire southern third of Tanaris. A good, relatively low-stress area to farm them is just north of the Dunemaul Compound as well as west of the Compound between Thistleshrub Valley to the south and the Noxious Lair to the north.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WokkaD</b></h3>In Tanaris : <br /><a href="/classic/npc=5423/scorpid-tail-lasher">Scorpid Tail Lasher</a> appears to share respwans with <a href="/classic/npc=5426/blisterpaw-hyena">Blisterpaw Hyena</a> and <a href="/classic/npc=5420/glasshide-gazer">Glasshide Gazer</a>.<br /><a href="/classic/npc=5422/scorpid-hunter">Scorpid Hunter</a> appears to share respwans with <a href="/classic/npc=5425/starving-blisterpaw">Starving Blisterpaw</a> and <a href="/classic/npc=5419/glasshide-basilisk">Glasshide Basilisk</a>.<br />In general, Scorpids, Blisterpaws and Basilisks appear to share respawns.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
