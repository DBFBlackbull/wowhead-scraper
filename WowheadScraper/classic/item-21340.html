Sod getting the bigger pack for now, I'm going to equip 2 of these instead. I've constantly got 2x16's filled anyway :)<br /><br />They can only store shards. It tells you how many are stored in the bag, and shards auto store in the bag, no more sorting :)<br /><br />Very happy 'lock *grin*<br /><br />*waits for Ichor of Undeath to shoot up in price now it has a decent use :)*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can equip only one of them, sadly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I find it quite funny, I normally keep about 8 shards max at any one time. Sometimes less if I have a healthstone. This bag should be a real improvement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the components to make it require you to go to AH or fight high level mobs..&nbsp; but who needs shard bags more than low level warlocks?<br /><br />holding shards isnt as big a deal (dont get me wrong, its still bad) when you have 4 14+ slot bags, but when you have 4 6-8 slot bags shards are a killer... but 5 gold is a lot to low level characters</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I made 2 of these babies an hour ago. I don't understand how some players sell them for 2G, because the cost of the resources is at least 4G (on my server). 30 Runecloth sells for 3G at AH, Rugged Leather 1 for 10s if you're lucky. Ichor of the Undead about the same price (on my server...). 50s for the thread. <br /><br />I hope to make some money out of this. I already sold 1, though I was too nice and agreed upon 3G. The guy had been walking after me (finding recipe) for over an hour to get the bag. :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>haha i just made one, picked up Ichor of Undeath (two of them) for 10s. woohoo i already had runecloth (didn't piss it all away during AQ event) and my druid had the leather so this cost me all of nothing to make :)<br /><br />-EDIT Taterrexx is a n00b, just the fact that it puts all my shards automatically in the bag is sweet. The fact that i went from holding 12shards&nbsp; (since i always had a bag dedicated to shards anyway) all the way to 24 (upgraded to the Scholo bag already) is huge.</div>
