With the horrendous drop rates and the easy linkage throughout the gorge, you have very little room to kite. If you are up for it though, perhaps I can offer some strategies -\r\n\r\nas a Warlock,\r\nDooming; open up with a doom, SB, then banish rank TWO. Use some sort of timers and time it so the moment banish two wears, you land a banish rank one, for a combined duration of 50 seconds. With running time, this means you have 4-5 seconds of leeway to screw up one of the banishes. However, on initiates especially, it's tricky as they have high shadow resist. If this is the case and you have no -resistance-on-target gear, you may want to use two banish rank ones, and going all out DPS in the meantime. Initiates have less HP but do more damage; a felhunter for dispels and shadow ward rank twos are a must-have. Slayers hit hard and kick ass, if you get crit and then MSed, you're dead.\r\nOR, straight-DPSing; pull with a curse (elements\/shadows) and fear spam as you dot and wand, recklessnessing or popping SB\/conflag if in danger of linking. This is faster, but harder; there is no safety from banishing, and you can get many adds with fear, but instead of the 3.5k damage\/minute you can more than triple it with gear. Recommended for SL, as you can take more hits (VW MD)\r\n\r\nAs a hunter too, they're soloable, but tricky indeed. The best way I found is the long, arduous task of sending pet in, DPSing for 10s, cower, FD trap, and repeating over and over. However, this means a small amount of DPS - maybe 4000 in a minute. About as fast as doom kiting, but more of a pain in that your pet's probably going to die every pull. Another possible alternative is to lay a frost trap and kite around it, retrapping when needbe, however this is only recommended if a good deal of kiting room is available, since getting in melee range is killer.\r\n\r\nAs a rogue, they're soloable too, but really only every 5, 3.5, or 2.5 minutes - you need evasion for it, and unless you have impeccable gear, you're probably going to want to prep evasion to keep yourself alive. Initiates are easily doable, kicks and gouges, but the slayers will tear any rogue apart in a moment if luck isn't on your side.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, one of the few classes that I haven't been able to solo farm the EoS is is... priest.

The Eye of Shadow drops off of Lord Kazzak, a very powerful elite boss in the Blasted Lands. Bring a raid group. Currently, you MUST be in the kill group in order to loot the Eye. Tigole says they plan to change this so you can loot the Eye even if you're not in the raid group. Update from Tregga: Well it seems Tigole was mistaken about the impending change. He just came back and said you will have to be in the group that tags Kazzak in order to have a chance to loot it. However, it was not intended to have the Priest epic quest loot only drop from raid encounters. The devs are looking into alternate methods for Priests to get the drops required for the epic quest.\n\nTips for fighting Lord Kazzak\n\nFirst of all, his attacks: \n\nMelee \nHis melee attacks are pretty weak, no more than 1500 hits on cloth users. \n\n'Shadowbolt Volley' \nShoots out an insanely long range volley of Shadowbolts that damage anything it can target in distance for 800-1000 damage. The volley totally ignores all line of sight issues: it cannot be dodged. \n\nTwisted Reflection \nCasts a magical debuff (on a random player in range other than the player with aggro) that heals Lord Kazzak for 25,000 health each time he deals damage to the player with this debuff. This combined with the Shadowbolt Volley can ruin the attempt. \n\nMark of Kazzak \nCasts a curse (on a random player in range with mana) that drains the target's mana for 250 per second and explodes for 4,000 AOE damage when there is no more mana to drain. A living bomb. \n\nCleave \nAttacks a number of melee range players around him with a cleaving strike that deals 1000-2000 damage to each. Since a 'blind spot' has not been found, Cleave might be capped to a certain number of players affected. \n\nThunderclap \nA point blank area of effect spell, hardly dealing any damage, but slowing movement speed. Some have reported 200 damage, some say it doesn't deal damage at all. Doesn't seem to affect attacking speed either. \n\nVoid Bolt \nA strong bolt he may cast only on the player with aggro, deals up to 3000 shadow damage (or more!). \n\nCapture Soul \nWhen a player, pet or totem gets killed, Lord Kazzak casts this spell to instantly regenerate 70,000 health. \n\nAlright, now you know pretty well what you're fighting against. Here's how the battle itself works: \n\nOnce he is aggroed and the fight begins, you have no more than three (3) minutes to kill him. I'll explain later why. He starts off with everything he's got. He keeps meleeing the main tank while Cleaving once in a while for rogues swarming around him and keeps sending Shadowbolt Volleys to hurt everyone around. The volleys are not on a timer, instead he casts them as he sees fit. In some rare cases there's about 30 seconds between the casts, sometimes he does it every five seconds. In the meantime, he casts Twisted Reflection and the rarer Mark of Kazzak on random people.","date":"2006-12-09T14:34:25-06:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":4,"id":12223,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"kreghx","body":"What to do here: \r\nSend your main tank in and let him build some aggro for a short while, just enough so he won't come at you the first time you cast something on him. Then unload. Have your DPS classes give him everything they have. Priests have to be extra mindful about the magical debuff he casts on your group. It has to be removed as soon as possible or the attempt will soon end in a disaster. Priests are also in charge of healing their groups thanks to that Shadowbolt Volley that keeps hitting everyone all the time. Mages need to be on top of the curse situtation. Mark of Kazzak can and will cause a wipe if you let it go off on you. Dispel the curse as soon as you can. All casters should also leave about 1000 mana in their mana pool just in case he casts the curse on you. That'll give the mages four seconds to dispel before it goes off. In other words, 1000 mana is out of mana in this raid encounter. Also, anyone dying during the fight is not an option. Unless it happens during the first five seconds of the fight, you've failed already. Do not use grounding totems, pets or other small things he can kill for the 70,000 health heal. \r\n\r\nYour group will have exactly three minutes to finish the demon off. If you fail to kill him in that time due to lack of DPS, people dying or not dispelling Twisted Reflection properly, Lord Kazzak will enter what is called the supreme mode. Named after his yell once it triggers, the supreme mode causes him to cast his Shadowbolt every second. That's 800-1000 DPS on everyone, kids, and that means a wipe.\r\n\r\n4. Combine the 3 items. Once you have all 3 items, combine them to form your new epic staff, Anathema\/Benediction. Using one form of the staff will change it to the other and visa versa. Congratulations! You're completed your Priest epic quest! \r\n\r\nUpdate: With the 1.8 patch, the staff can now be successfully enchanted. Only one enchantment can be applied to the staff. You cannot have one enchantment per side.\r\n\r\nUpdate 3\/28\/06: From Indanak on the Bloodscalp Server:\r\n\r\nWe have a group of 4 priests: Flathra, Moonora, Feoria and myself.  We selected one priest ( Feoria ) to accept the quest (we all were able to join the quest with her).  The other 3 of us stood on the hill with the NPC.  We didnt move and were able to heal the humans as they walked towards us.  So we had 4 people healing them at once.  Only 2 humans died and we all got the Splinter of Nordrassil.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\nCan only heal and abolish disease on humans.\r\nCANNOT heal party members or a boss spawns and tears everyone to shreds.\r\nthe 3 members who are on the hill cannot move.","date":"2006-12-09T14:35:29-06:00","rating":-6,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":28843,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"3079","body":"Priests need this item for the epic staff quest, the other piece needed drops in Molten Core in Major Domo's loot chest, eye of divinity","date":"2007-02-01T10:13:52-06:00","rating":-7,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":6,"id":62040,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Mikezila","body":"This is more or less worthless now.

For some reason, it seems that when the Eye of Divinity drops, the drop rate of the Eye of Shadow jumps up to 33% off mobs. Just a tip so you don't waste your time trying to get the Eye of Shadow. (This is according to my guild - we have seen two Eye of Shadows drop in four mob kills. Both priests had the Eye of Divinity with them.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kremonte</b></h3>For people looking to try solo farming this, best of luck to ya. With the horrendous drop rates and the easy linkage throughout the gorge, you have very little room to kite. If you are up for it though, perhaps I can offer some strategies -<br /><br />as a Warlock,<br />Dooming; open up with a doom, SB, then banish rank TWO. Use some sort of timers and time it so the moment banish two wears, you land a banish rank one, for a combined duration of 50 seconds. With running time, this means you have 4-5 seconds of leeway to screw up one of the banishes. However, on initiates especially, it's tricky as they have high shadow resist. If this is the case and you have no -resistance-on-target gear, you may want to use two banish rank ones, and going all out DPS in the meantime. Initiates have less HP but do more damage; a felhunter for dispels and shadow ward rank twos are a must-have. Slayers hit hard and kick ass, if you get crit and then MSed, you're dead.<br />OR, straight-DPSing; pull with a curse (elements/shadows) and fear spam as you dot and wand, recklessnessing or popping SB/conflag if in danger of linking. This is faster, but harder; there is no safety from banishing, and you can get many adds with fear, but instead of the 3.5k damage/minute you can more than triple it with gear. Recommended for SL, as you can take more hits (VW MD)<br /><br />As a hunter too, they're soloable, but tricky indeed. The best way I found is the long, arduous task of sending pet in, DPSing for 10s, cower, FD trap, and repeating over and over. However, this means a small amount of DPS - maybe 4000 in a minute. About as fast as doom kiting, but more of a pain in that your pet's probably going to die every pull. Another possible alternative is to lay a frost trap and kite around it, retrapping when needbe, however this is only recommended if a good deal of kiting room is available, since getting in melee range is killer.<br /><br />As a rogue, they're soloable too, but really only every 5, 3.5, or 2.5 minutes - you need evasion for it, and unless you have impeccable gear, you're probably going to want to prep evasion to keep yourself alive. Initiates are easily doable, kicks and gouges, but the slayers will tear any rogue apart in a moment if luck isn't on your side.<br /><br />Oddly enough, one of the few classes that I haven't been able to solo farm the EoS is is... priest. Anyway, best of luck to ya.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7121</b></h3>Not too bad to farm, really easy. Lord Kazzak drops it, or the demons in winterspring have a low drop on it. Farmed 2 in less than 2 hrs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kreghx</b></h3>Obtain the Eye of Shadow. The Eye of Shadow drops off of Lord Kazzak, a very powerful elite boss in the Blasted Lands. Bring a raid group. Currently, you MUST be in the kill group in order to loot the Eye. Tigole says they plan to change this so you can loot the Eye even if you're not in the raid group. Update from Tregga: Well it seems Tigole was mistaken about the impending change. He just came back and said you will have to be in the group that tags Kazzak in order to have a chance to loot it. However, it was not intended to have the Priest epic quest loot only drop from raid encounters. The devs are looking into alternate methods for Priests to get the drops required for the epic quest.<br /><br />Tips for fighting Lord Kazzak<br /><br />First of all, his attacks: <br /><br />Melee <br />His melee attacks are pretty weak, no more than 1500 hits on cloth users. <br /><br />'Shadowbolt Volley' <br />Shoots out an insanely long range volley of Shadowbolts that damage anything it can target in distance for 800-1000 damage. The volley totally ignores all line of sight issues: it cannot be dodged. <br /><br />Twisted Reflection <br />Casts a magical debuff (on a random player in range other than the player with aggro) that heals Lord Kazzak for 25,000 health each time he deals damage to the player with this debuff. This combined with the Shadowbolt Volley can ruin the attempt. <br /><br />Mark of Kazzak <br />Casts a curse (on a random player in range with mana) that drains the target's mana for 250 per second and explodes for 4,000 AOE damage when there is no more mana to drain. A living bomb. <br /><br />Cleave <br />Attacks a number of melee range players around him with a cleaving strike that deals 1000-2000 damage to each. Since a 'blind spot' has not been found, Cleave might be capped to a certain number of players affected. <br /><br />Thunderclap <br />A point blank area of effect spell, hardly dealing any damage, but slowing movement speed. Some have reported 200 damage, some say it doesn't deal damage at all. Doesn't seem to affect attacking speed either. <br /><br />Void Bolt <br />A strong bolt he may cast only on the player with aggro, deals up to 3000 shadow damage (or more!). <br /><br />Capture Soul <br />When a player, pet or totem gets killed, Lord Kazzak casts this spell to instantly regenerate 70,000 health. <br /><br />Alright, now you know pretty well what you're fighting against. Here's how the battle itself works: <br /><br />Once he is aggroed and the fight begins, you have no more than three (3) minutes to kill him. I'll explain later why. He starts off with everything he's got. He keeps meleeing the main tank while Cleaving once in a while for rogues swarming around him and keeps sending Shadowbolt Volleys to hurt everyone around. The volleys are not on a timer, instead he casts them as he sees fit. In some rare cases there's about 30 seconds between the casts, sometimes he does it every five seconds. In the meantime, he casts Twisted Reflection and the rarer Mark of Kazzak on random people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kreghx</b></h3>What to do here: <br />Send your main tank in and let him build some aggro for a short while, just enough so he won't come at you the first time you cast something on him. Then unload. Have your DPS classes give him everything they have. Priests have to be extra mindful about the magical debuff he casts on your group. It has to be removed as soon as possible or the attempt will soon end in a disaster. Priests are also in charge of healing their groups thanks to that Shadowbolt Volley that keeps hitting everyone all the time. Mages need to be on top of the curse situtation. Mark of Kazzak can and will cause a wipe if you let it go off on you. Dispel the curse as soon as you can. All casters should also leave about 1000 mana in their mana pool just in case he casts the curse on you. That'll give the mages four seconds to dispel before it goes off. In other words, 1000 mana is out of mana in this raid encounter. Also, anyone dying during the fight is not an option. Unless it happens during the first five seconds of the fight, you've failed already. Do not use grounding totems, pets or other small things he can kill for the 70,000 health heal. <br /><br />Your group will have exactly three minutes to finish the demon off. If you fail to kill him in that time due to lack of DPS, people dying or not dispelling Twisted Reflection properly, Lord Kazzak will enter what is called the supreme mode. Named after his yell once it triggers, the supreme mode causes him to cast his Shadowbolt every second. That's 800-1000 DPS on everyone, kids, and that means a wipe.<br /><br />4. Combine the 3 items. Once you have all 3 items, combine them to form your new epic staff, Anathema/Benediction. Using one form of the staff will change it to the other and visa versa. Congratulations! You're completed your Priest epic quest! <br /><br />Update: With the 1.8 patch, the staff can now be successfully enchanted. Only one enchantment can be applied to the staff. You cannot have one enchantment per side.<br /><br />Update 3/28/06: From Indanak on the Bloodscalp Server:<br /><br />We have a group of 4 priests: Flathra, Moonora, Feoria and myself. We selected one priest ( Feoria ) to accept the quest (we all were able to join the quest with her). The other 3 of us stood on the hill with the NPC. We didnt move and were able to heal the humans as they walked towards us. So we had 4 people healing them at once. Only 2 humans died and we all got the Splinter of Nordrassil.<br /><br />Key Points:<br />Can only heal and abolish disease on humans.<br />CANNOT heal party members or a boss spawns and tears everyone to shreds.<br />the 3 members who are on the hill cannot move.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mikezila</b></h3>This is more or less worthless now. It's down to like 10g on my server, and there is a backstock of more than five of them at the auction house.<br /><br />Nobody goes into MC anymore, so unless you have 39 friends with four hours on their hands, getting your epic staff is more or less impossible.<br /><br />You could buy it for cheap now, wait until you get 70, and then go into MC with a much smaller party. Like 15 or 20 can do the entire instance.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Since 1.8 I've been farming this for a few hours a day. I take the first right tunnel and setup on the rock with a couple of friends and we kill for a few hours a day and still no drop! Is there a loaction perhaps deeper in where people are getting the drops more frequently?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After a nice short LBRS run we dicided to farm the eye of shadow in WS. 2 mages, 2 priests. Already the fifth mob (hederine slayer) dropped it. I was the lucky guy to get it. Since there was a second priest within the group, we dicided to continue. Guess what? The tenth or eleventh mob dropped it again!<br /><br />Is it true that Blizz increased the droprate? Or was it just a hell lot of luck? Dunno. <br />Majordomus, we´re coming...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>*sigh*<br />The Eye of Shadow can be picked up or equipped by any class. It's only used for the Priest epic staff quest (The other parts are listed as priest only so don't even wory about it) it has no effects for any other class but Priest and thats only when combined with the other Priest only trinket called the Eye of Divinity from Major Domo's chest. If your not a Priest and you have this item it really does nothing when you equip it, I suggest you sell it or give it to a Priest friend who needs it.<br />I'm surprised how many times I see this explained but people keep asking what it does because a few have been spreading rumours about untrue effects the Eye of Shadow has.<br />Edit: A few days after posting this I went farming for some with a Druid friend. We killed 3 Initiates and 1 dropped then we killed probably about 8 or so and another dropped.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jan 9 18:50:01 2006</div>

I spent probably about 9 to 12 minutes fighting before I got it.<br /><br />On Alliance AH for 600g right now.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This item is used in the Epic Priest staff quest Balance of Light and Shadow, shown here:<br /><a href="/classic/spell=23151/balance-of-light-and-shadow">Balance of Light and Shadow</a> doesn't do anything for any other class except allow them to see the ghost priest for the priest quest. You can get them off slayers and locks in the demon area in the southern most part of Winterspring and off Lord Kazzak in the blasted lands (need a raid party). I have not gotten mine yet, but I have spoken with many priests who have gotten it. They report it can be done with a 60 war/60 priest, 60 pally/60 priest and even a 60 druid/60 priest. Through all of these inquiries, I found the droprate varied. Some got it very quickly others spent as much as days farming. I don't know if lower levels can get it, but I don't see why not as it is able to be farmed by any class, seems weird if they put that type of limit on it.<br />I hope this will be mine within the month but no luck thus far.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Mar 29 13:56:42 2006</div>

I have however looted about 10 pieces of felcloth and some runecloth, but I really want this eye as I'm broke!

Im going to hire me a few rouges (which are like mexicans at The Home Depot standing out front looking for work). I said I would pay them 200g each if it drops. Ha! it wont drop, what are the chances of that. So me and these 3 semi-decent rouges start our quest. <br /><br />I buffed us with Pray of Fortitude. We start killing, and its going rather nicely. On our 20th guy (6 of which were the mana doglike things) and 30mins. EOS is there. Im 600g in the hole, but thats ok. <br /><br />They were happy, made mad money. I spent 30 mins of my time.

I was in Frostwhisper Gorge earlier today, collecting Tears of the Hederine for my Doom Guard, and this thing dropped. Anyone who really wants Anathema/Benediction should be going to Kazzak. Since you also need a drop off Majordomo to get the staff, if you're serious about getting it Kazzak shouldn't be a problem to kill. His droprate of this thing is way better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farmed for the eye for four straight days.<br /><br />The best advice is to get a group of a warlock (for adds) + mage/warrior/rogue + yourself (all can make it go faster) and to farm the first caves area after the front area. Just keep killing all the spawns (even the felhound manastalkers) in succession and you'll have wave after wave of continual respawns with little downtime. Even if you cannot get three usually two works, although a warlock is preferable for the banish/doom method.<br /><br />Had horrible luck on drops. No blues, very few greens except on the last night where the eye dropped we had five green drops in a row then the epic.<br /><br />Best of luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Since getting Eye of shadow is almost impossible on some servers, bliz should either fix kazzak as instance boss or make Eye of shadow drop from some other instance boss (like onyxia drop mature blue dragon sinew) or make a quest for Eye of shadow (like soloing a lvl 61 elite demon or something).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am all for opening the Eye of Shadow up to the guilds who can't seem to fight Kazzak. My guild has never downed him, and we're gearing up to fight Domo this weekend. However, the new drop rate on these things is dumb. Three people in my guild have them.<br /><br />Given that a good player can solo these mobs, it doesn't really make much sense to have the drop rate be so out of whack. I went up to winterspring to farm the 6 of Portals, but I had an easier time getting this-first Herderine Slayer I fought...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>One dropped for a non-guild mage and priest and myself (warr). About number 18 in. Was total luck.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i soloed at least 250 of the slayers and initiates but got no drop at all:(<br />only got 20ish demonic runes, 10 felcloth and<br />a bunch of mushrooms and runecloth:(<br />I must be seriously unlucky or something...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Did anybody else realize that the droprate dropped (haha :|)?<br />I used to farm these shortly after it was announced that the droprate was raised - and indeed it was raised as I got one almost daily.<br />But since a few (mini) patches ago - I've seen nothing. I killed at least 200 slayers/initiates since my last drop and I found nothing. :(<br /><br />My guess right now is, that you have to have a priest in group (or on the server) who has the quest for that item - otherwise it won't drop. I know that sounds strange and contradicts some of the posts here - but it's the only explaination I have. There used to be at least 2 EoS on the AH on my server each week - but for the last few weeks (if not months) I hardly see any on the auction house. So there must have been some sort of change because I know that beside me there are several other people _trying_ to farm this, too - and they all told me that they realized a massive drop in the droprate.<br /><br />*sigh* I used to live so good back in the days when this was easily farmable. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>seems that its purely a matter of luck and thats it. spent another 3 + hours there tonight with a group and no luck at all ... and for the people that are saying the the other mobs dont drop anything, i guess that's the key to getting the eye. we got 3x thor lock boxes and various greens while there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is undoubtedly the hardest peice to get. I got my eye of divinity about one month ago and did the quest 1 hour later. Passed the quest first try. I have farmed every weekend for the past 4 weeks, and logged over 60h farming for this &amp;*!@. I came on today and tried to get people together to help. Nobody wants to help anymore because it takes so much time. So i had the great idea of going on my friend's hunter to try soloing them. Had to kite them as far as everlook just to kill them. Some random noobs would help me along the way when they saw me kiting, but basically i soloed them all. Killed 30 and it dropped! I FREAKED! I yelled all over vent and blew out a few eardrums. I hearthed to IF and gave it to my guild master to hold for me while i logged on. I logged out to get on my priest...but the server was down. I have the eye waiting for me, and its like *!@#ing hell waiting to get on. Its been 3 hours and i still cant get on. This is the day of the 1.8 patch, so all u readers probably know what im talking about. I cant believe i got it, but its damn torture knowing i have it but cant use it yet. : ( Good luck farming to all of you preists that think its hopeless. I thought it was hopeless, but i kept at it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have checked Blasted Lands and Winterspring, Every monster that drops the Eye of Shadow is 59-60 (Elite) Why is the range listed between 56-60 ?<br />I have spent hours looking for demons of a lower level, and cant find any monsters capable of soloing,<br /><br />Anyone know of areas specific, that do have the lower level demons wandering?<br />need the damn eye...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Are these still selling as of patch 2.0?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>a priest in my guild has farmed over 30+ hours (not alone of course)... sadly have got many uncommon (green) items, 1 rare (blue) item, and 2 epic (purple items)... odd that seen more epics than drop than rares, ah well... back to farming since kazzak is always screwed over</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yeah, i would like to know if this only drops once you have the item from the Domo chest or will it drop for anyone farming these demons.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My first one got ninjaed by a Paladin in a Kazzak raid....<br /><br />I gave my second one I got from Kazzak to a guildy who already had divinity.....<br /><br />Now I'm farming for my third to actually get my own staff!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wowZhenek</b></h3>518 mobs killed since pvp patch (0 dogs killed) and counting. Did not get it. But I got 2 pristine diamonds. I smell a stealthnerf to droprate tbh. I've been making money with eye farming and on average it'd be 2h/eye. Now its been 20hours already over 3 6-7h sessions ... No wonder eye jumped to like 450g in price, from 300 ...<br />nice #nochanges basically ... disgusting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arccai</b></h3>Funny story.<br />I was teaming up with a Warlock for a duo farm, we spent about 3h in the southern part of Winterspring killing Hederine Slayers, and Initiates.<br />At the very end without luck on our side i decided to call it for the day, so i ran to Everlook.<br />And as i run back he says another one just spawned, i turn around, and replied <b>Okay, last one.</b><br /><br />And it actually dropped!<br />From the last mob we killed, and i wasen't even suppose to kill him because i was heading back.<br />He rolled 2, i rolled 8.<br /><br />Unbelievable moments, still speechless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grimgrins</b></h3>I've got one on Live still. IDK why I have it. Hahaha.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jwaggin</b></h3>It's unique so you can only have one in your bags at a time if youre farming. Had 2 in a row drop with one in my bag already. The corpses though dont seem to really despawn if theres an eye on them because i had time to run to town/mailbox twice without the corpse despawning. There were respawns already and it was there still</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>biglollol</b></h3>They drop from trash in Kazzak raid as well.</div>
