<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Warlocksrock, you are an idiot.&nbsp; Enchanting is so expensive, especially when the mats needed keep going up in price because of CGF's.&nbsp; The price of our mats go up, so do our enchants.&nbsp; If you don't like it, don't buy the enchant, it's as simple as that.&nbsp; Don't tell us we are greedy, we are just trying to make back the fathoms of gold we spent on mats and leveling up our enchanting.&nbsp; If the price of mats and formulas went down, the price of enchants would also go down.&nbsp; Simple economics.</div>

I give away waaaay too many free enchants, so it puts me even deeper into debt.&nbsp; While I understand that this is my fault, it's not so much the money that I care about; its the fact that I'm stuck in a profession that gives me absolutely no benefit over any other professions whatsoever, at least in terms of items only person with the profession can use (such as Engineering or Blacksmithing).&nbsp; My anger only increases as I find out that other professions are getting even MORE benefits in The Burning Crusade, while from what I've seen enchanters are still going to be stuck enchanting other peoples' crap, not benefiting themselves in any way other than a financial one (if they're lucky).&nbsp; I've been considering dropping this profession for a while, but I think this is the last straw... I just hit 300 enchanting and stupidly trained Crusader before realizing how friggin expensive the mats for this rod are.&nbsp; Someone is going to have to give me a REALLY good reason not to drop this profession.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah you need an arcanite rod to make it.<br /><br />Got the mats for a low low price of 50g but finding a blacksmith is a pain in the butt to make it.<br /><br />Actually found a very nice smith in outlands who made me one from my mats :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Enchanting is one of the most frustrating crafts out there.&nbsp; Opposed to BS'ing and similar crafts where base cost of items roughly falls in a general range; enchanting follows no such rules.. thank you freebie enchanters.&nbsp; Even the first real decent enchant (fiery/icy) is offered without tip only to level.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, enchanting may take longer.. but tips are needed to keep the craft a profession and Not a gimmie.&nbsp; I can't count the number of times I was turned down for job solely due to the phrase, &quot;Pfft, I'll find/know an enchanter who can do it for free.&quot; - Even with a humble 10-15% base mat cost tip requirement.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone throws a remark at a 10-15% tip, don't be afraid to add a little detail of why your profession costs the way it does.. some points to hit:<br /><br />- Rod cost (which DRAMATICALLY increase as you level)<br /><br />- Material Cost (lets face it.. not all enchanters do constant instance runs or farm farm for greens - although it's a good idea when you can)<br /><br />- Inflation (yes, if you use your mats.. that &gt;&gt;&gt; DOES NOT &lt;&lt;&lt; make you obligated to give a discount to your enchant/job! - base your tip off an estimate from the current mat costs on the auction.)<br /><br />- Frelance work (enchanting isn't like an item-creation craft - it has infrequent customers to which you will find the need to charge)<br /><br />- Recipe cost (not all recipes are found through the trainer.. you may need to do an instance - aka Uldaman, travel to new areas - aka the outland, via the auction, BoP drops, quests, etc.)<br /><br />**One reliable means of making gold is to sell materials.. I know it sucks for those like myself who wish to keep the mats for level-up / alt-chr enchants / etc. -&gt; So, sell the mats for enchants you cannot level any further on. (which isn't a bad idea)<br /><br />**Charge for enchants - 10-15% isn't that much to ask for - the low level enchants mostly go for free.. which in all honesty is no sweat off anyone's back.&nbsp; - but a safe start is at least 150-200 skill.<br /><br />Happy crafting. d(^-^)b<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~ Ty Moonspire<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sargaras server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My way of making money with enchanting is simple, disenchant stuff thats worth about 1g in the AH and loot the things you get out of it, then sell them on AH. Icy chill sells for 50-60g but the essence of wind only is worth 30g So you make a lot more money if you sell the mats instead of the enchant (on my server)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if u look at just the vender price for all the greens and blues that enchanters de just for mats to lvl enchanting to 300 so they can do thses high lvl enchants...enchanters waste the most gold of any professions. if u think its not the most expensive...try starting enchanting and one other...only buying mats from ah and lvling them both to 375...you'll find out that enchanting is (by far) more expensive.<br /><br />so next time u say an enchanter is greedy...lvl your own enchanting to enchant yourself and leave us hard working enchanters alone</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Earning with enchant/tailoring isn't hard. <br /><br />When I'm in need of cash, I buy 2g worth of linen cloth on AH (thats 8-10 stacks), use tailoring to create a bunch of green pants, disenchant those pants and sell the dust and occational essence for 5-6g on AH. It works with other types of cloth to, 7g of silk cloth can be made into 20g of dust and essence, and so on.. <br /><br />Ofc. I wait for a day with low cost cloth on AH and sell the dust on a day with high dust prices. It takes a little patience, thats all..<br /><br />Take advantage of the fact that prices on mats vary greatly from day to day. Specialize in a couple of those big juicy enchants people like, and then monitor the AH daily and scoop up the mats on days with low prices. <br /><br />Then you wait for a day with high prices on mats and start offering people the enchants based on the high mats price. They will argue that you are too greedy, you quote the mats needed and tell them to go look at the AH prices and do the math. After that, you haggle a bit and settle on a price the customer likes, you fight to keep a small profit but just might end up doing it &quot;for free&quot;, all the time you smile internally, thinking of the low price of your mats and the nice big profit you are about to make.<br /><br />Works like a charm for me..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>why can't they make these damned rods backwards compatible? It's bad enough that I have strange dust, soul dust, vision dust, dream dust, illusion dust, small/large glimmering/glowing/radiant/brilliant shards, greater/lesser magic/mystic/nether/eternal/astral essences taking up bank space, among other misc. encahntign reagents(icecaps,righteous orbs) but I also need to keep every single runed rod because the fancy new ones can't perform the task of the old?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I believe it is used in all enchanting spells level 300, 295 does not require arcanite rod</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What enchants require this rod? Or is it made to replace all other rods? If you have answers please explain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Arcanite rod is required for a couple of the 285 and 290 enchants. Mostly the ones requiring significant rep grinding - friendly to revered with AD/TMH/TB.<br />Would be <i>really</i> nice if each rod used/consumed the previous rod and you only had to keep the 1 rod...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Go get enchanting, enchanters need rods for diffent amounts of skill, this one is the greastest one needed</div>
