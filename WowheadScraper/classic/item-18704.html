That and grinding AV rep held no appeal to me.  Anyway, long story short it was on  the 774th kill that I get my drop (right before an MC run, a good day all around).  Anyway, I thought I'd help with some of the math behind the likelihood of this dropping to keep people's spirt up.\n\nNote: This technique will work for any drop.  I post here because this thread (and the disparity between farming for 3 minutes vs. 3 months) confused me somewhat.\n\nThe chance that this thing will drop is about 0.1% , which is to say 1\/1000 (0.001).  This means the the chance of it NOT dropping is 100% - 99.9% (0.999).\n\nFrom statistcs we know that if you have two consecutive events you can find the likelihood of both events happening by multiplying the chance for each individual event together.  Thus the likelihood of NOT getting the sinew after killing two dragons is (0.999)*(0.999)=0.998. In other words after two dragons you're not very likely to have picked it up.\n\nWe can generalize this to the likliehood of recieving the item after N dragons: (0.999)*(0.999)*...*(0.999)=(0.999)^N.  Now let's pick a reasonable likelihood to shoot for, like 50%.  So the number of dragons you need to kill for your likelihood of NOT getting your sinew to equal your chance of getting your sinew will be the value of N that satisfies: 0.5=(0.999)^N.  Employing logarithms we can solve for N and we find our answer to be 693 dragons.  So it took me a little longer than I expected to get it, but not to far off.\n\nNow one should note that this doesn't mean that when you kill 693 dragons that you have a 50\/50 chance of it dropping, it only means that after 693 dragons the likelihood of your NOT having recieved your sinew is equal to the likelihood of your having recieved your sinew.\n\nHope this helps someone out there optimize their time and lower frustrations.","date":"2006-04-19T00:12:12-05:00","rating":48,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"he's not saying that after having killed so many dragons your chance of getting it is suddenly higher, he's saying that you're likely to get one if you kill around a certain amount of dragons. its like figuring out your chances of getting 5 coin tosses in a row. your chance of getting one is 50%. your chance of getting two in a row is 25%, because 1\/2 x 1\/2 = 1\/4. you're chance of getting three in a row is 1\/8. your chance of getting four in a row is 1\/16. your chance of getting 5 in a row is 1\/32, and so on.","creationdate":"2006-05-12T14:02:12-05:00","id":1280592,"rating":5,"commentid":3068789,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Tirazik","importedSubject":"RE: Some Math"},{"body":"What are you guys talking about?

Not sure why it doesn't have the other mobs, but all of the Blue Elite Drakonids in Winterspring have a chance to drop it. Droprate is rather low, but you might get lucky and not have to pay 300+ some Gold or wait on a raid on ol Azuregos.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9379</b></h3>Your looking at apx 0.1% drop chance. If your in a friendly guild who like to farm together, take 2 friends down and make sure one is a skinner, as quite a lot of money can be made from coin drops also, more than 3 people would limit the profit, and may make some people think they wasting their time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This drops from Azure, the blue dragon. i Got it 2 days ago. When doing the huter epic quest, this is the item which makes the epic hunter quiver. The onyxia sinew is used for making the bow string. The last item u need is the ancient petrified leaf from Majordomo executus in Molten Core. It drops from his chest.<br />With this leaf u proceed to felwood, get the quest form the trees to A) kill 4 demons to get the staff B) Get onyxia's black sinew for bow string, C) Get blue sinew from Azuregos for the quiver.<br /><br />Presently, i am trying to get the leaf to drop from MC.<br />U can have 4 paladins in ur group at the time that u fight the bosses, for their auras. As long s they dont do anything during the fight, their auras, buffs and potions of all sorts should b used and the fights are relatively easy if u know how to exploit their weaknesses.<br />Get potions of EVERY kind (especially demonslaying) and get every kind of druid/priest/paladin buff before u fight them. good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went ahead and farmed this because, well, I do love me some purple. That and grinding AV rep held no appeal to me. Anyway, long story short it was on the 774th kill that I get my drop (right before an MC run, a good day all around). Anyway, I thought I'd help with some of the math behind the likelihood of this dropping to keep people's spirt up.<br /><br />Note: This technique will work for any drop. I post here because this thread (and the disparity between farming for 3 minutes vs. 3 months) confused me somewhat.<br /><br />The chance that this thing will drop is about 0.1% , which is to say 1/1000 (0.001). This means the the chance of it NOT dropping is 100% - 99.9% (0.999).<br /><br />From statistcs we know that if you have two consecutive events you can find the likelihood of both events happening by multiplying the chance for each individual event together. Thus the likelihood of NOT getting the sinew after killing two dragons is (0.999)*(0.999)=0.998. In other words after two dragons you're not very likely to have picked it up.<br /><br />We can generalize this to the likliehood of recieving the item after N dragons: (0.999)*(0.999)*...*(0.999)=(0.999)^N. Now let's pick a reasonable likelihood to shoot for, like 50%. So the number of dragons you need to kill for your likelihood of NOT getting your sinew to equal your chance of getting your sinew will be the value of N that satisfies: 0.5=(0.999)^N. Employing logarithms we can solve for N and we find our answer to be 693 dragons. So it took me a little longer than I expected to get it, but not to far off.<br /><br />Now one should note that this doesn't mean that when you kill 693 dragons that you have a 50/50 chance of it dropping, it only means that after 693 dragons the likelihood of your NOT having recieved your sinew is equal to the likelihood of your having recieved your sinew.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone out there optimize their time and lower frustrations.</div>

And now I'm hearing stories of (not only on this site either) people getting their sinew after a few mobs/minutes/hours/days. Or even on their first mob! Well, more farming tomorrow I guess.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hmm. I think I'm gonna park my Rogue in the cave in Mazhoril to farm for both arc crystals, the mechanical arcanite dragonling schemata and the sinew, as I have a 52 Hunter alt that will be soon using it. I am a decently geared Rogue, with a tad over 4k hp. If you look at my profile under Tressa of Blackrock, you will see my setup. I have no trouble taking down the 58 casters or the 56 &quot;Female&quot; looking dragons. Havn't tried the male ones yet. I'll give that a bash later.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was farming for this today when another person who was farming them whispered me and gave me 1 :D he had found 1 two days previous and couldnt carry any more :D so myself and 2 other hunters from my guild came back 2 farm and within an hour we got another !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LOL I go look for black lotus if its there, it's not. then a mob aggros me and I start runing but think, what if it drops it, AND IT DROPED! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my opinion, if you are just farming in order to sell this for a profit, you are much better off farming for the Crusader formula, chances are it will sell for more, plus it has a 0.18% chance to drop rather than a 0.09% chance to drop. I have farmed 5 of them. Kept one, split earnings on two of them, and got all the profit from the other 2, about 450g each thats 1350g plus i have the enchant... good game. Still takes a long time to farm though, no doubt</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>do u get this from skinning the dragons or just a regular loot?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Man, reading all these &quot;Hey, I got it after ten kills&quot; and so forth...<br /><br />It makes farming this thing seem easy as hell but truthfully its a pain in the ass to farm. I spent a total of 34 hours trying to get it, in the process saw:<br /><br />Pattern: Robes of Winter Night x 6<br />Recipe: Greater Arcane Prot Pot x 5 <br />Recipe: Flask of Petrification x 1<br />Orb of Deception x 1<br /><br />Lots and lots of green armour and weapons, and those grey ones too<br /><br />Farming periods varied while doing it, probably spent 4 weeks trying to get it.<br /><br />So... don't go in with high hopes... I was desensitized to the point where i was like &quot;WTF is this crap, when did mobs drop bandages&quot; when i saw it drop<br /><br />Good luck to whoever tries getting it though</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LOL, having done this Quest ages ago, about the time when they changed that u can get the bow and the staff together, I remember the 1st sinew i got was from those blue dragons in winterspring, while doing the Ony Q's killing the dragons. Then another dropped while i was helping another friend, and this morning I was checking for thorium and then it dropped again. So im either extremly lucky or Im just fated to get this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maribomba</b></h3>This dropped of a Cobalt wyrmkin for me after killing 510 cobalt elites</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cullitia</b></h3>Farmed this with my Hunter buddy over the weekend. He gave me his sinew since he'd experienced the thrill of Rhok'delar in vanilla so I had my bow at this point thanks to him!<br /><br />The Mature Blue Dragon Sinew dropped off of a Cobalt Wyrmkin. Overall, he had about 800 kills spread evenly across all the types of Dragonkin in the cave, as well as Manaclaw over the course of about 3-4 days. I was probably there for 300-400 of those kills over 2 days.<br /><br />We were also in a raid group when it dropped (just the two of us) - mainly cause I made a troll comment about maybe drop rate being better in a raid? After making it a raid, it dropped within about 20 kills. :') Not sure if a raid group makes it better or not, but why not spice things up to try and appease RNGesus? :D<br /><br />He would solo outside of the cave and then with a party of 2, the cave was easy to clear out from the beginning to Manaclaw and back (respawns would be happening right on time with this so long as there weren't any other cave farmers). <br />We had a pretty easy time with Manaclaw as 2 Hunters, but it could get rough with a pet freezing or you freezing with Manaclaw's aggro on you - might be worthwhile to just skip him if you're unsure and focus on the Dragonkins. Whelps don't drop it, but it's worthwhile to kill them for the room in the hallways of the cave as well as the whelp pack could respawn as a Dragonkin instead (we just ignored the packs beyond Manaclaw - usually always whelps).<br /><br />Good luck and happy farming! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>silyar</b></h3>You can only get the quiver after you got the leaf from majordomus.<br /><br />Thanks to someone anonymous on wowdb!<br /><br />By far more interesting information then how many dragons everyone needed to kill, thats what the drop rate info at the top of the page is for...<br /><br />By Anonymous on 09/20/2005 (Patch 1.7.0)<br />You get the quiver from one of the 3 quests you get from the tree spirits in Felwood that spawn after you get the Ancient Petrified Leaf...<br />All you have to do for the quiver part of the quest is turn in a Mature Blue Dragon Sinew, super rare epic drop off of blue dragons.<br />The other two quests are for the 4 demon heads which give you a Rune Etched Stave and one quest is to turn in a Mature Black Dragon Sinew which gives you Enchanted Mature Black Dragon Sinew and then you right click the staff once you have the enchanted sinew and etched staff and then it forms the Rhok'Delar Longbow of the Ancient Keepers/Lok'Delar Stave of the Ancient Keepers.<br />Good hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mattslayba</b></h3>After killing 2536 of these, it finally dropped from a mageweaver outside of the cave. For ~700g on my server currently, it probably wasn't worth grinding. Almost any other money making method would have made more than enough gold to purchase it. I believe the drop rate is actually a consistent .1% for all of the dragon types, however the mageweaver's are definitely easiest to kill, so if you do decide to grind it, always go after those first.<br /><br />If you're looking for info on this item, it is used for the epic Hunter quest after you've looted the Leaf from Majordomo's chest in Molten Core. Turning in the leaf at the trees in felwood will open up this quest: <a href="/classic/quest=7634/ancient-sinew-wrapped-lamina">Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina</a>. Completing that quest will yield the reward: <a href="/classic/item=18714/ancient-sinew-wrapped-lamina">Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vaipo</b></h3>Been farming this for about 5 days now. total of about 1000 elites across the 3 different types and 25 manaclaw kills. <br />Not a single sinew. <br />Dropped about 4 Arcane dragonling schematics, 8 robe patterns, 10 or so Greater Arcane protection elixirs and ~500g worth of vendored greys and greens. <br />Also picked up 2 random blues worth about 20-40g. <br /><br />One might say its not worth the time investment but I'm subborn and will keep farming till I get it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>t0lkien1</b></h3>I'm wondering if these even drop anymore. Been farming for three weeks solidly. Thousands of mobs, nothing. Even had friends farming for me, so add many hundreds to those thousands. None available on the AH during that time either, which tells me there's something possibly wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Plurii</b></h3>So here is my little story with this item:<br /><br />I'm a relatively fresh 60. I just joined a new guild and had my first MC run. I got 3 Set Items and 1 Off-Set, because the only other Hunter already had those items. Immediately people start complaining and I feel terrible because I got most of the loot on my first run with them. <br /><br />So the run is over, we cleared everything except Ragnaros (got it 2nd run). I go through Winterspring to get a pet (ability) and get dismounted by these blue dragon elites. I kill it and this thing drops. I got TSM (Addon) installed so right away I knew this was worth a lot. Googled it and saw the drop chance... <br /><br />I then mail the item to the other Hunter (who just got the leaf) as a nice upgrade for his new bow and hope that reliefs me of some guilt of what happened before - Also, it literally took me 1 kill to get it...<br /><br />Then I got the leaf and went on farming. 3500 kills and nearly 4 weeks later it dropped for me. It was painful to say the least. <br /><br />And 3 days ago the third one dropped (only 100 kills later) for some nice cash.<br /><br />Besides a fun story, this also is my attempt at saying: Don't give up! It 'will' drop... Just a matter of time. <br /><br />Keep on grinding boys :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ilthalaine</b></h3>Decided to get a kill tracker, after having already killed hundreds of elites.<br /><br />So far:<br /><br />Cobalt Mageweaver = 63<br />Cobalt Wyrmkin = 73<br />Cobalt Scalebane = 82<br />Tracked Total = 218 Blue Dragons<br /><br />Drops so far have been the BoP tailoring pattern, the Arcane Protection Pot, the dragonling schematic, a handful of greens and greys, and lots and lots of rugged leather.

I still don't have the Leaf for the quiver quest.<br />Always get a bunch of mage water to refil your mana quick and Heavy Runecloth bandages for your pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nemoolcay</b></h3>Got this after 28 hours of farming.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ToOurRoots</b></h3>60 Scalebanes, 67 Mageweavers and 98 Wyrmkin later. Got it off a Wyrmkin.<br /><br />Got a second one at 103 Magebanes, 79 Scalebanes, and 132 Wyrmkin off a magebane.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LivingBones</b></h3>Feel bad for being that guy, but I got the sinew from Ony yesterday, and figured I'd farm this, since none is up at my AH. I very luckily dropped it after less than 20 mobs... Dropped off a Scalebane I think, the biggest ones. Feeling blessed considering the hard grind it was for some, but that's just RNG for you...<br /><br />Don't give up, it can always be the next kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>esapol</b></h3>I'm sitting at close to 2100 kills at the moment. It's maddening. However, I have gotten a decent amount of greens to DE, as well as health and mana pots for raid. I'll update again if it ever drops.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/11/2020 - I was over here today farming the invasion mobs and decided to stop in and kill a couple of the Dragonkin. After about 30 minutes it dropped, couldn't believe it. Final kill count<br /><br />Cobalt Wyrmkin 1211<br />Cobalt Mageweaver 1196<br />Cobalt Scalebane 1128<br /><br />Add about another 100 more from before I started tracking and total is ~3545.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Barfboy</b></h3>Obscenely rare. I'm a person who enjoys tough farming, and don't get bored easily. While initially just going for the blue tailoring pattern, I decided to keep going till I had the sinew. I finally received a sinew from a mageweaver within the cave after approximately 1500-1600 kills as a warlock. <br /><br />It feels around 1/10th the drop rate of the eye of shadow down south, as ive seen many of those. Based on my experience and reading I would estimate the sinew' drop rate is between 0.1% and 0.25%.<br /><br />Tips I've learned: <br />-You cannot control RNG, but you can control kill rate. Bring affordable consumes to assist you. Consider even speccing optimally. <br /><br />-Ignore the cave, the whelpings (which dont drop) block paths everywhere and killing them slows your effeciency greatly.<br /><br />-Don't bother with the inner dragons, there is no evidence they have a higher drop chance then a typical mob. Never heard a soul who had success with them.<br /><br />-Mageweavers are priority, they are by far the easiest and have additional drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>illbilli</b></h3>I have gotten 3 so far this month <br /><br />1 off the mageweaver<br /><br /> Then yesterday and I know this will upset others but it can happen I ended up getting 2 within 30 minutes of each other. They dropped both off the big Scalebanes and if this happens to you make sure you put one up on ah or mail it to an alt before you go back to the farm. Luckily I had a friendly guildmate to come meet me while I held the corpse open for approximately 10 minutes. You cannot hold two nor can you store one in your guild bank and hold the other on your person. You can put one on the AH and go back to farming. <br /><br /> Keep killing and it does not matter if you do them all at once I left and came back and the first one I killed dropped it then I kept going and after 16 mobs the other dropped. I spend about an hour or so each time while I wait for my AV queue on Stalag where the queue is about an hour and fifty minutes :(<br /><br /> GOOD LUCK</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CharlzO</b></h3>Just passed my 2000th kill today, three weeks in, still nothing but dozens of greens, dozens of arcane pot recipes, half dozen robe patterns, and some misc patterns here and there. By far though, the most frustrating part isn't that it hasn't dropped yet. It's watching non-hunter classes come out, farm, and then see them list the Sinew in the AH shortly thereafter. Frankly, they should be paying me a commission fee, since my non-drop kills probably bumped up the odds of them actually getting theirs. The other thing to watch for, is the people that insist the entire hillside is yours. When I see other hunters farming, I tend to localize myself to an area and leave them be to theirs, and most of the time, that seems to be reciprocated. But every so often you'll get the people that just run after every single mob regardless of if you're attacking it, or aiming to, or not. <br /><br />And on a personal note, if you happen to be out there and you see someone that's been obviously out there farming without luck, comments like &quot;oh you'll get there, I just got my 7th, so keep at it!&quot; will make me hate you, and your entire existence. You are exactly the type of person who's been getting the drops while I'm not, and I despise you and hope you get sucked up the fiery rear opening of Ragnaros.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chedah</b></h3>Don't know if they changed the drop rate on this item, but I have had 2 drop in the last week. Total kills ~300. First one dropped after about 75 kills. I never turned in the quest and kept farming to see if i could get a 2nd and sell it.<br /><br />Low and behold, about 200+ kills later a 2nd dropped. Off of the same exact mob (spawn location outside of cave).<br /><br />*NOTE* - if you have one (bank/bag) it won't let you pick up. I had a friend come pick up for me (I traded him mine - then looted). I sold one for 450g, then got my original back.<br /><br />The drop rate may be affected by having the quest not completed - this is speculation, not sure. <br /><br />Sharing in hopes it helps some of you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>IronArsenal</b></h3>just over 3400 kills and trade chat calling me a @#$%^ and quitter for posting WTB and finally it dropped.<br /><br />stick at it guys. takes time but it has no choice but to eventually drop</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eyzi</b></h3>I got it after 297 kills (107 scalebanes, 101 mages, 88 the other ones).. If the drop chance would be 0.1 % then the chance of dropping it after those tries is roughly 77%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LivingBones</b></h3>SoD: Wanted to highlight this can drop off <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=10196/general-colbatann#drops">Colbatann </a>as well. It's not in the stats yet, but don't sleep on this guy, mine dropped off him. I've tried to upload the data I had, but it might take a while I suppose, or it wasn't in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maluman</b></h3>i did azuregos for the first time today and it dropped and the loot master gave it to me. so no farming or getting out rolled, lucky me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ClepTheRtard</b></h3>I'm losing my mind—killed 1,934 dragons and still got nothing. To make it worse, I only installed the addon after 5 hours of grinding, so I don't even know my actual kill count.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mesmus9</b></h3>I've been farming these blue dragons for so long with no sinew drops that i have made enough gold from looting them to just buy the thing from AH....</div>
