<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the recipe for this off the repeatable Bloodpetal Sprout quest in Un'Goro Crater.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I happened upon this recipe on the second time I turned the 15 bloodpetal sprouts to the guy. I guess i'm just lucky it's retailing around 20g on my server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've turned in over 50 times now and starting to lose count and patience.&nbsp; Every trip I make to Un'goro I make sure to get a minimum of 5-10 packages.&nbsp; I still have not seen anyone selling the potion or the recipe either.&nbsp; Argh!<br /><br />T</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Now you know why it is called the Elixir of BRUTE FORCE</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My advice: Wait till someone is going to sell this recipe. Most people don't know how much it is worth. I bought mine for 20g on a high pop server. I would have payed even more... because you can spend weeks farming in Un'Goro for it... It's awesome: Together with Elixir of Fort. I can buff myself (rogue) with 300 additional hp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whew, after finding out about this, I spent about 5 hours one night trying to get the recipe. Turned in the quest about 7 times, no luck. Then a couple nights later, I'm standing in Orgrimmar and see someone shout that the recipe was for sale on the AH. I rushed in and got it for 8g buyout (Woot!). I sent him a tell thanking him, he told me that he got it on his first try :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Same here, Done this bloodsprouts gathering thing so many times I am sick to my stomach. It seems the ppl that want it dont get it and the ppl who dont care or dont know how much its worth get it on first try. This sucks big time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've done this literally over 100 times (stopped counting after that) and I still don't have the recipe. I haven't seen it in the auction house for weeks and think it may have been removed (intentionally or otherwise) after the honor patch. Has anyone gotten this since then?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wow theres some angry folk here, I've only fed that stupid kodo 5 times and all he wraps me up is cheese, and I always say a little prayer before I open up the package hoping it it will contain my beautiful formula but not yet. On the plus side, there are a lot of other valuable things to collect in the crater, so I usually still make 5g or more an hour feeding that thing, so it's not a complete loss. I wish he'd just cough it up already!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just got the recipe today... but server is only 1+ months old... + i m not that rich.. feeling the pain still&nbsp; ouch</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it sounds like the quest to get this recipe is a pain.&nbsp; i never knew there was a quest to even get this recipe, but i got the recipe at the AH for 2g (buyout price).&nbsp; i've seen this recipe plenty of times for less than 10g, so i'd suggest just buying it if possible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>62 turn ins, still no recipe...<br /><br />And to everyone saying they see it on the AH for 2,8,10 gold, ya I wish.&nbsp; I've seen it maybe three times on my server and each time it was 200 gold buyout.&nbsp; The quest is the worst one Ive ever done, but no way Im gonna pay 200g for it. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went and bought it at the AH.&nbsp; It was the first time I'd ever seen it, and I'm 57...so it doesn't pop up too often.&nbsp; Anyhoo, the seller didn't put a buyout price on it (curse him) so I waited around and watched the price go up from 5 to 105g on bids only...ouch.&nbsp; I had to borrow and pay a friend back...but it was worth it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i am sorry to say that, but the recipe dropped at the <b>first</b> time i ve done the feeding, and i had no idea that this was a rare drop. I forgot to put it in AH, just send a tell to trade chat (when i was on gryph) 6 people answered back. I let them make the bargaining, finally 2 guys left, one of them gave <b>60g</b>, and other said 57g is all he have:) i think it is not that worth but no matter for me, i got my money :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For the person who posted right before mine... I was the alchemist who did not have &quot;to pay&quot; anything more than 57g. In fact I have allot in the bank but the way your auction was going I don't think you would have satisfied until you drained one of 2 bidders bank account. I did the wise decision (wise back then) and stopped at 57g since I saw everytime I bid you were coming with a higher bid and I was not sure if there was really someone who I am bidding against.<br /><br />Anyway, this is quest number 30+ of handing out bloodpetal sprouts to the big fat dino and nothing so far. I got allot of other stuff I sold, mind you the zone is pretty good for high end herbs, but no recipes. Made almost 200g selling the herbs. Exp is good too.<br /><br />Now, I wish I bought it at 60g, or even at 100g, but then again I was not sure when the bidding war was going to stop. I backed up so one of us 2 alchemists gets it for a relativly reasonable price. <br /><br />Don't you guys be amazed when we charge you 2 arms and 2 legs for the potions we sell.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />One thing I learned, that this recipe does exist. I know I will get it soon too. Else, tough luck.. for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I remember noticing that this potion didn't stack with either Prayer of Fortitude, or with Elixir of Giants, can't remember which.<br /><br />Anyone know?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I tried and I tried and I tried, got alot of potions, kits, herbs and exp.. finally I got the recipe on my last attempt before I quit. I lost count after 200 times...<br />Kinda sucks to try that much but I guess it's luck.<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>LOL first turn in and BOOYA, got this recipe.<br />I didnt even know you could get this recipe from doing that stupid quest.<br />Gotta love that luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I purchased this item for 25 gold from an unsuspecting Alliance hunter who apparently was unaware of its rarity as he initally listed it at 2 silver with no buyout on the Ironforge Auction House.<br /><br />What's more, is that I play on the Horde faction and used someone else's account to scout for good deals on the opposing side. Upon receiving the recipe, I immediately transferred it from the proxy account to my own via the Gadgetzan AH. So, not only did he sell it to me at a fantastic price, he also unwittingly aided his enemy in the process!<br /><br />Ah the ignorant, how I love them so.<br /><br />As for those still wondering; yes, it does stack with fortitude/prayer of fortitude, mark of the wild/gift of the wild and other potion buffs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the recipe on first turn in after completing all marshal refugee Qs (save the one ith silithid lair). Wonder if there's a connection?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just have to brag: I (level 49 shaman alchemist) read about this rare recipe here on Thottbot and decided to take a look around Un'Goro to discover the area, collect silversage and bloodpetal sprouts.<br />One full circuit of the crater gave enough sprouts to hand in to the kodo. Lo and behold: the recipe was in my first wrapped present!<br />I'm one very happy shaman, looking forward to buffing my guildwarriors on the next outing :-)<br /><br />If you need some made just whisper or mail Gruugg on Steamwheedle Cartel (horde side ofc).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got the recipe for elixir of brute force. <br /><br />but now I wounder if it's worth farming for to sell the elixir on AH or is it better to sell the herbstaks of gromsblood and plaguebloom that I have farmed for the elixir?<br /><br />what is the sellingprice on your server for the elixir? I'm on the server dragonblight and I have never seen the elixir on any of our AH:s.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>One more question...<br /><br />On my server 1 elixir sells for 2,5g. That mean that 5 elixirs should sell for like 10-12g. Why make this elixir and sell it if you can sell the ingrediens for mutch more gold?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone who pays more than 10g for the recipe for this is an idiot. It doesn't stack with fort, so it's hundred's of gold for a recipe to make a +18str... That's retarded.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the best bit is, although the recipe sells for stupid money... theres never any of this stuff on the AH. and i dont mean it gets bought out... no one ever puts any up lol.</div>
