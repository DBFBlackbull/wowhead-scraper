<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The easiest moonwell to get to for Horde players in is Ashenvale. Go west from Splintertree post and cross the first bridge, take the first path to the left. That path leads right to the moonwell at 60,72.<br /><br />There are only level 26 critters in the area :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>...has a moonwell.&nbsp; It's right by the Taurens, so you can't miss it.<br /><br />I'm on the horde side (warlock) so I usually go to Felwood to the Ruins of Constellas and use the tainted moonwell.&nbsp; While I'm moving towards the well, I kill the satyrs and I can usually pick up one piece of felcloth in addition to 1-2 demonic runes as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is a moonwell in the middle of the park in Stormwind.&nbsp; There is no blue light coming out of it like in the others but it works just the same.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On my server (Thunderhorn), Felcloth is now selling for about 3g each on the AH. Need 2 to make one Mooncloth, so that's 6g. While one Mooncloth is selling for 10-12g buyout, so while it's still nearly double your money, you gotta consider the 4-day cooldown into your cost, so its not as much of a money-maker as it has been. Better to farm for your own Felcloth and save it than buy it in the AH now. Just kill demons in Felwood for a couple hours and you'll have enough Felcloth to last for a couple weeks' worth of Mooncloth, then its all profit, plus you always get a chance of other good drops, and cash while killing the demons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lol, you can in fact level tailoring from 250-300 just using the mooncloth transmute.&nbsp; I only missed the sklllup twice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>7. In Auberdine, just NE of Flight Master platform (I used to go there with my Hordie 'cause I couldn't think of any others)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If felcloth is 2G each, and mooncloth is 20G each, that's 20-(2*2)=16G profit on each mooncloth, or 4G every day on avg... so you're saying that prices were inflated for 500 days before they came back to normal? :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since none of the coords matched up and made this place a pain to find, I shall endeavor to paint a picture with words:<br /><br />Look at the river which runs just to the side of Splintertree and follow it south.&nbsp; About 3/8ths of the way south of the length between where the river meets the road road (the one that bisects the entire map) and the river ends is where the moonwell is.&nbsp; The moonwell is just west of the river.<br /><br />I realize that was not the clearest of descriptions, but hopefully it will get you looking in the right place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The best moonwell to get to for the horde anyways is in Ashenvale it's easy to get to and you don't have to sneak up to it or anythng and the cords are 59,72.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Seeing as how mooncloth has lost its lustre with BC, they should reduce the cooldown like they did with the arcanite transmute. How about a 2 day cooldown instead of the blasted 4?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where is the Moonwell so i can make the mooncloth from the felcloth?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>a lot of folks think mooncloth is useless now because of the advent of netherweave bags in the expansion, but I disagree...<br /><br />* it's a different combine to skill up with... regardless of the built-in delay creating mooncloth<br /><br />* the raw cost of materials for the two bag types is still very close, depending how much felcloth goes for on your server<br /><br />* the two bag types both have 16 slots and netherweave bags do sell for a few gold less, however mooncloth bags don't bind on equip like netherweave bags do so the mooncloth bags are worth more (and retain a resell value)<br /><br />I'll grant the naysayers that it's value is diminished, but I feel Blizzard did a good job of introducing a new, competitive product without completely devaluing what was already in existence</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So many people make it to difficult to understand how to get to the moonwell near Raynewood Retreat, so allow me to try to simplify it.<br /><br />From Splintertree Post, travel west on the main road. You will cross the Falfarren River and continue following the road west until you reach the spot on the map where Silverwind Refuge is directly south of you from the road (if you don't have this on your map yet, head to the middle of Ashenvale and go south to discover this region). When you face north on that same road, there will be a glowing (birdbath? hehe) torch and a bench with a book on it. From the columns, go directly north, through the clearing and straight over a spot of bumpy rocks and tree roots, and continue north until you see little lanterns. Follow those, and they will take you right to the well. Hope that helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I spent all that time making mooncloth and farming felcloth, and now it's worthless.
