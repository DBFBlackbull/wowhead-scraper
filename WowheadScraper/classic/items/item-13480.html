<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A small convenience fee is fair, obviously because of the time wasted. However, most farmers don't do it to save time for the buyer, they do it because they want to inflate the price 1000% and make money off of a system that is intrinsically flawed because it gives rewards for focussing on making money from something that does not belong to them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The difference between farmers and playes are Farmers do not need the item they do it for financial gain only thus halting the progress of other people well earned skill tree's.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The hunter joke is really getting old...<br /><br />anyways, to sum it up. The vendor is in the first house to left after entering the town Everlook at winterspring. To get to everlook you have to travel or dying through the timbermaw cave at northern end of felwood. An alternative is to have goblin engineering and use the transporter to teleport yourself in. (If you get killed using that, please don't sue me. :P) There are both alliance and horde flight master at Everlook so once you are there you will always have an easy access route.<br /><br />The recipe is limited supply and a rather lengthy respawn time. If you really want the recipe then camp the vendor by all means. If you feel there are too many competition from the opposite faction, just kill the other player and run out before the guards kill you.)</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
