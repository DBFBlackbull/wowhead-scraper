The orcs there can be killed fast and drop 1-3 runecloth almost in every kill. As a rogue I can get about 5-6 stacks per hour of farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6828</b></h3>The post above me provides a good location, however I think that you'll find that the undead citizens of Karazhan (in Deadwind Pass after the orcs) is a better place. In an hour I can easily get the number he is talking above and they drop significantly more silver. The respawn rate is considerably better as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6832</b></h3>I've heard rumors that it will be profitable to farm up 7 or 8 stacks of runecloth to have ready when the expansion comes out. There will be new bandages to be learned and anyone with first-aid will need runecloth to skill up. Also, once other people realize they need runecloth the demand will be higher and so stacks might be sold for more in the AH. In that case, it might be good to farm up a good amount of runecloth right before the expansion and set them in the AH then.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6770</b></h3>@ durogaul<br /><br />Netherweave cloth bandages is the next step<br /><br />Manual: Netherweave Bandage -&gt; requires 330 first aid<br />Manual: Heavy Netherweave Bandage - &gt; requires 360 first aid<br /><br />They can be purchased for 2 and 4g <br /><br />They heal 2800 and 3400 dmg over 8 secs respectively<br /><br />Hope that helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9147</b></h3>If there is anything that I've learned about the Auction House it's that there is always a better deal. For example, runecloth. On both my alliance server and my horde I have noticed the price of runecloth vary from as low as 85s a stack to as high as 3.5g a stack, and not on seperate occasions. It is in my experience that even though you may be in a hurry to buy a few stacks of runecloth, or any other high end stackable item, don't settle for the first page of the item on the Auction House. There is awlays a better price. Save yourself a few gold and take the extra second to check all the pages, you never know what sort of deal you will get, trust me, I've gotten some great deals.<br /><br />-darkwatcher</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SeriusJones</b></h3>I've heard the rumor that you should save 300-ish runecloth to level up to the next bandage in the expansion (prices will go up so think ahead -.^)<br /><br />- SJ</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9296</b></h3>On average you can buy them off the auction house for 2g/a stack. These drop of 50+ Mobs and can be easily farmed and found in the Plaguelands, Winterspring and Felwood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>yarrly</b></h3>Runecloth is also needed for the Paladin Epic Mount quest, 40 of them to be exact.<br /><br />For the other items you need for this quest, refer to<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7642">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7642</a> for additional info.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8888_</b></h3>Currently the best way to gain faction with your home factions, i.e. if you are Alliance, gaining rep with SW, IF, Darn, and Gnomish.<br /><br />I have 7 Epic mounts to date at the moment, which requires exalted with the three other alliance factions, all of which was done with multitudes of Runecloth.<br /><br />You can make good money in the market with Runecloth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arcanium</b></h3>A great place I have always liked is Silithus. Tons of humanoid mobs everywhere, they drop runecloth all the time and if you are 70, forget 'bout it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>43817</b></h3>today as i was lvling from 57-58 in EPL, Browmans Mill, i got 20 stacks of runecloth in about 5-6 hours. Truely an awesome place to farm runecloth, mobs range from 57-60 very easy to kill 1 or 2 as a 57 shadow priest. very high drop rate, bout 1 in 3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Returner99</b></h3>imo the best place to farm this at lvl 70 is at the troll temple in EPL. I got 171 runecloth in less than 1 hour as a sublety rogue</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Indignation</b></h3>The casters at Blackrock Stronghold in The Burning Steppe have an absolutely phenomenal drop rate for runecloth. If there isn't anyone there, I highly suggest you farm there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>48589</b></h3>There also seems to be quite frequent drops from the ogres round Dreadmaul Rock in Burning Steppes, mostly the mages it seems to drop the most on</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>my favorite place to farm runecloth, is in WP and by killing scarlet spellbinders.. they drop 2-6 each time! + u might even find the crusader formular :O</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>50ish mob will drop runecloth just like:<br /><br />40ish mob drop mageweave<br />30ish mob drop silk<br />20ish mob drop wool<br />10ish mob drop linen<br />0ish please go questing.<br /><br />the upper 40ish humanoids (level 48 or 49) are the starting point of dropping runecloth but you will have to farm 50+ mobs to get constant drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In each major city there is an NPC with the title of &lt;cloth quartermaster&gt; or something like that. They offer the quests, &quot;a gift or wool/silk/mageweave&quot; (no linen cloth) that requires 3 stacks(total of 60) of cloth units, and give you 150 rep each (at least thats what I got for each turning in those three quests at lvl 54).<br /><br />Once you finish the wool/silk/mageweave quests, the NPC will then offer a quest for runecloth. He/she asks for 60 units, but once you finish this quest you will then get a repeatable quests that requires only 20 runecloth. (I beleive it also gives you 150 rep but i have not tried yet)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Most efficient farming spot for me has been the stronghold just south of Blackrock Mountain in the Burning Steppes.&nbsp; Outside the stronghold you can pull most of the slayers and locks 1 by 1.&nbsp; Inside you will deal with at least 2 at a time.&nbsp; Very fast farming with a rogue.&nbsp; Kill all the mobs outside and walk away with at least 15 runecloth then kill all the mobs inside and have a stack and a half.&nbsp; By then the mobs outside are respawned and you can repeat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you want to turn in Runecloth for rep, you first need to finish the Donations of Silk, Mageweave, and Wool. Only when you complete those will the Runecloth (repeatable) quest show up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im a 300 enchanter and I'm lv 55 so it was about time I got some rep with Timbermaw and got the <b> +15 agi 1h </b> and <b> +25 agi 2h </b> enchants.<br /><br />Out I went into Felwood (its easier to farm rep by killing the Felwood Furblogs as they are lower lv) and started farming. After quite a short time (within a few hours) I had gotten to friendly and had farmed 700 runecloth!<br /><br />The drop rate is <b> amazing </b> as you get 5 rep for every furblog you kill + they drop 1-12s in cash + they drop random blues and greens (I got Sandales of the Insurgent from them and a few rare recipes) and they drop 1-3 runecloth per kill, they can also drop feathers which can be turned in in stacks of 5 for 75 rep! They also gave me 300-600 (depending on rested or not) exp per kill! <br /><br />So having a rep with Timbermaw is one of the best things wow has to offer! You can go and kill the Felwood Furblongs either for <br />1) Blues and Greens<br /><br />2) Reputation with Timbermaw<br /><br />3) Exp<br /><br />4) Runecloth and gold farming!<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />Its helped me get over 300g!<br /><br /><b> Nickhissom - Deathknight of &quot;The Uprise of Valar&quot; guild<br />Stormrage </b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You can get to halfway through honoured (6,000 out of 12,000) through just questing and killing certain mobs (I don't know which ones)<br /><br />So from there you would need 6,000 + 21,000 = 27,00 rep<br /><br />divide by 50 (rep per stack of runecloth) = 540 stacks (10,800 pieces of runecloth)<br /><br />say 3g per stack on the AH and you're looking at spending over 1,600g to achieve exalted, and since the only reason you want to get exalted is for an epic mount you still need to spend another 800g to buy the mount<br /><br />So you could end up spending 2,500g on your epic mount - I'm looking forward to it, bring on an Epic Raptor for my Orc</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>do anyone have a close guess as to how many runecloth is needed to get from Honor 50% to revered and from revered 0% to exhalted?<br /><br />i hope its not in the millions.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok face it people when TBC comes out the value of this will dissapear as the lvl 70 will be able to get it so much easier. As such selling your runecloth now, while its still expensive means more gold then waiting. if you really need runecloth then sell what you got now and buy more new runecloth for the same money whne the prices have crashed. (Or grind for it when you're on your way to lvl 70).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i will very rarely pay more than 1.4g per stack (20 runecloth). Have reached 8000/21000 so far =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>100 runecloth go around 8-10 G on my server:P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farming some of these high dropping rate mobs requires that you be a higher level. If you're in the early 50s, the humanoids in the Jaedenar cave in Felwood have a decent drop rate. They drop anywhere from three to five stacks per run through, which isn't that bad if you can do it quickly.<br /><br />Also, handing in a stack of Runecloth now gives 75 rep not 50. Getting from Honoured to Exalted now only takes 280 stacks. 2G per stack, 560g, plus the 600g for the epic mount: 1160g. Not that bad. :D</div>
