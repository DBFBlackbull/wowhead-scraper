However, as far as making gold this is not the way with alchemy. Someone mentioned\nabove about selling your Arcanite Transmute instead. That is for sure not the path\nto making gold with alchemy. Servers vary greatly on items I keep this is mind, but the transmute that really makes you money is Transmute: Elemental Fire. This\ntransmute is gained by reaching friendly reputation with the Thorium Brotherood.\nThis is not hard at all considering one of the repeatable quests you can turn in involves Kingsblood. If your an alchemist and don't have herbalism you are just a fool. The great thing about this transmute is the 10 minute cooldown. I simply transmute in between picking dreamfoil and in a couple of hours I have a ton of Greater Fire Resistance pots. These sell for 13-15 gold per 5 stack on my server. I buy the Heart of Fire from the AH for 8-10 gold per 10 stack. Which 10 Heart of Fire equals 30x Elemental Fire. I sell lower than everyone else. Which immediately means I will sell lower than the guys who were lazy and payed 15-20 gold per stack for thier Dreamfoil.

I have seen this thing drop in Scholo twice. I am not sure if its coincidence or if there are higher drop rates in their because they are undead.<br /><br />It also goes for a pretty high price on the AH depending on server. I have seen it anywhere from 150g - 300g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kunou</b></h3>The price is really unfair nowadays.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4985</b></h3>You turn a profile on it fairly quick Essence of Undeath are like 1g tops on my server and water are like 5-8g so it makes money fairly quick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>agreed, I see this recipe for 80g on Lightbringer. People ask if its worth it to pay for that recipe, I say yes. Just from Scholo runs alone I've banked about 80 undeath, now imagine x-muting all that to water and selling em for upwards of 10g a piece compared to the 50s-1g for undeath. I think its MORE than worth it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did get this from a nice dude in IF.<br /><br />Got it for 5 Gold!.......<br /><br />My lucky day :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those saying Water to Air is better.&nbsp; HA!&nbsp; <br /><br />Come to gorefiend where the price of air is slowly dropping, and water is slowly rising.&nbsp; Water now costs about 13-16g, and air costs about 20g<br /><br />Undeath only costs like 1g, so I have been scouring the AH for this drop.&nbsp; ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The reason this transmute costs so much is because level 35 transmute alts cant 5 man scholo.&nbsp; This is the HIGHEST PROFIT transmute available for level 35 alts, and is easily worth the money.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I really need this, it'e the only of the transmutes that is good.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as written above, this recipe is superior. you can easily get 1 essence of undeath for ~1g since the drop rate of these are sweet and ppl are running strat that often that the essences arent worth a *!@# :p with this cute recipe you can transmute one eou into an essence of water which sells for ~10g on stormscale server, bad its a cd on 24hrs-2days :\ <br /><br />bought the recipe for ~160g on bid, next day id sold one essence for 10g, ding! this recipe will make me a millionaire in the long run :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This recipe is ACTUALLY worth this 200 G!<br />OK....show me the money then.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would love to have this transmute because it's the last one i'm missing. However, as far as making gold this is not the way with alchemy. Someone mentioned<br />above about selling your Arcanite Transmute instead. That is for sure not the path<br />to making gold with alchemy. Servers vary greatly on items I keep this is mind, but the transmute that really makes you money is Transmute: Elemental Fire. This<br />transmute is gained by reaching friendly reputation with the Thorium Brotherood.<br />This is not hard at all considering one of the repeatable quests you can turn in involves Kingsblood. If your an alchemist and don't have herbalism you are just a fool. The great thing about this transmute is the 10 minute cooldown. I simply transmute in between picking dreamfoil and in a couple of hours I have a ton of Greater Fire Resistance pots. These sell for 13-15 gold per 5 stack on my server. I buy the Heart of Fire from the AH for 8-10 gold per 10 stack. Which 10 Heart of Fire equals 30x Elemental Fire. I sell lower than everyone else. Which immediately means I will sell lower than the guys who were lazy and payed 15-20 gold per stack for thier Dreamfoil. Even with spending the 8-10 gold I make over 50 gold everytime I transmute 10 Heart of Fire.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On Earth Ring:<br /><br />Essence of Undeath = 1-3g each<br />Essence of Water = 7-10g each<br />Essence of Air = 15-18g each<br /><br />So you can buy an Undead in the AH and transmute it to Water and resell it on the AH for an average profit of 6.5g.<br /><br />Or, instead of paying a ridiculous amount of money to get this Transmute or hoping that you luck out and get the recipe from a world drop that has a lower than .01% drop rate you can simply do the Scholomance quests and get the Recipe: Transmute Water to Air.<br /><br />Then when you buy a Water on the AH at an average of 8.5g and transmute it to Air and resell it for an average of 16.5g, you net 8g each day.<br /><br />You do the math, and I'll bet you it's pretty much the same on most servers. This recipe isn't worth crap.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Mar 23 10:57:02 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Don't forget that in using this transmute, you're missing out on making money from the Arcanite Transmute (usually 4G on my server).</div>

I certainly dont see STV listed above as a recorded drop spot for the recipe so i guess u can pray you catch a little of my luck on this drop if you grind out in STV. As to where it droped in STV, well that shall remain my little secret :) Ok fine think Mega monkey :)<br /><br />AS an alchemist im keen to learn it but again im torn with will i be as lazy a transmuter as I am a tailor with mooncloth, haha.<br /><br />Who cares its like 200g minimum anyways :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Prices are all over the place at the moment or there's just too many of these recipes around. On Grim Batol Essence of Undeath: 2.5G, Essence of Water: 4G so there's currently not that much profit in this anymore</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tahuma</b></h3>For those in Classic WoW, regardless if you're in Phase 1 or reading this in Phase 6, this recipe is ALWAYS very sought after. <br /><br />Essence of Undeath has marginal uses, but has a bloated drop rate since Stratholme and Scholomance will always have people getting these as drops daily, and Essence of Water has more uses + requires farming mobs out of your way. Ergo, people will be wanting to transmute their undeath into water for a fairly large profit (undeath on my server, Phase 1, is less than 3g, whereas Essence of Water is upwards of 10-15g)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>EquineForm</b></h3>This seems like the most profitable transmute in the game.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
