It's tricky, it's dangerous and it can be frustrating; however . . . I am dying less than I did before.  \n\nDM EAST \n\n\/eek \n\nTime to drive down the prices on the AH, folks.\n\nThis can be stealth farmed for Dreamfoil, Gromsblood, Ghost Shrooms. There are two nodes each of Dreamfoil and Gromsblood in the lower courtyard and a couple Gromsblood on the way back out of the zone.  Here's how you get to them: \n\nEnter through Pusillin's side (Entrance A on Atlas) \n\nI like to kill the treant that wanders to Pusilin because the walking weed drops savage fronds for the AD faction quest.  So far I've received 3 fronds off of him each time.  He's a caster and he roams so he may or may not be at the entrance when you zone in.  Up to you whether or not to wait for him.  Fight him somewhat near Pusillin or you may get aggro from the treant trio that also wanders that area. \n\nHop down from the top . . . watch the pathers and the stuff that's below you. Not sure how druids will fare, but rogues will suffer 1400-2k damage. It's been that varied for me. \n\nWatch out for Warpwood pods. They do one of five things:\n[ul=circle][li] Nothing, it will just open[\/li]\n[li]Will be lootable to get Thornling seeds \/ Runn Tum Tubers[\/li]\n[li]Poison cloud . . . move out of it, but Not towards a mob[\/li]\n[li]Will spawn about 4 non-elite thornling looking things, either remain stealthed or blade flurry them down (use your thornling seed if you want)[\/li][li]It will root you in place and do minor damage, not so good if you've got wanderers meandering your way![\/li][\/ul]\n\nThese will open automatically for all but the thornling seed. You'll have to gauge range. This is what killed me the most, bad luck + inexperience with the poison one (got poisoned too close to mobs and got aggroed).\n\nSome herbs are uncomfortably close to mobs. You'll have to decide whether you want to go for it or not: \n\nThe single elite lashers are immune to blind so don't expect that to save you. If you do aggro one, I'd gouge, run a bit of a distance Then vanish . . . they hit too hard for me to solo (or it's their poison).  You'll have to figure it out for yourself whether you can take these or not. I cannot.  High nature resist Might make it possible . . . I died before I was able to collect much data as to how had they hit, etc . . . .\n\nSometimes you can wait for the mob to move to its furthest point from the herb, distract and loot.  Make sure you're at your furthest range from the herb to gain maximum distance between yourself and the mob.\n\nYou Can solo the groups of non-elite lashers with some talents. A thornling seed can be used for a little extra dps. Evasion + Adrenaline Rush + Blade Flurry \n\nBe aware of the pathers that run across the . . . well, path. They're fast. They run the same path each time, though, so just use that patience thing and watch where they path and gauge how long you have to loot that herb node.  Distract works well to buy a little extra time.\n\nThose are the issues I can think of. There Will be some times when you will just have to give up a node b\/c it's too close to a mob. It stinks, but oh well. \n\nIn my experience, one in every 6-8 runs a dusty tome will spawn.  Out of the four that have spawned for me, two have produced the Shammy FR trinket book, Frost Shock and You, or whatever the name is, I'm not a shammy so I don't care, all I know is I make 45 gold off the books.  =D  Let me think of how to describe its location . . . SE wall of the CY, no mobs around to harrass you, but there is a warpwood pod you'll want to get rid of first.  One of the sets of pathers Nearly reaches the area but you'll be just out of aggro range even if you're next to the book.  Just walk along the east wall of the CY and run your mouse over the area, it's really difficult to see on my screen so this is the method I use.  It will pop up on your tool tip thingydohicker if it's there.\n\nNow you have the choice of leaving the zone or going through to kill the singles and looking for chests. I Can solo the trios . . . I had to vanish after killing the ranged damage demons, but it was worth it. There are a couple more Gromsblood nodes on the way out. Some you can get to, some you will have to pass up or fight for.\n\nIf you decide to continue through the zone, beware the stealthing demons, they will be in the hallways every time and then there will be some in corners here and there.  They see through stealth, butyou can pop a CS on them . . . I don't have MoD and so far, even with them distracted, I have been unsuccessful at ambushing so cheap shot it is.  They also break out of kidney shot early, my Guess would be that they may have an ability to do so, not sure, tho.  Anyway, take it slow until you figure out where they are so you don't get a surprise . . . vanish is useless against them unless you can put some distance between you and it.\n\nIt basically took me about 6-7 deaths the first time through and now I'm down to about 1-2 deaths b\/c I'm still testing boundaries and limitations (i.e. whether I can take that single elite demon surrounded by his 4 little non-elite demon spawn . . . so far the answer is a resounding no - the main man died but his little demon friends made mulch of me). If I don't try anything risky I can go through with no deaths. \n\nReset the zone x 5 and you can get up to 15 dreamfoil \/ gromsblood out of the courtyard alone. It's been a lot nicer for me than running around the other larger zones. At least I'm guaranteed these nodes will be up in DM, it's up to me to figure out how to get to them. \n\nEach of the mobs drops up to 26 silver. I've accumulated a decent amount of RC \/ Felcloth as well as grabbing some grey items and the ocassional chest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7423</b></h3>Yes indeed, winterspring seems the place to go for it, as you can gather Icecap there also which are needed for Major mana potions.<br /><br />Coming TBC im sure that new pots wont require it as much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7517</b></h3>If you're after money, dreamfoil is great. However, dreamfoil is ALSO used to make every greater resistance potion currently in the game. So if you're a raider, I would recommend saving it. Resistance potions are very helpful for fights like Ragnaros and Princess Huhuran.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4336</b></h3>I farm this riding around in WPL and EPL. Theres nobody there and you can pick a lot of other flowers while looking for dreamfoil. Everybody goes to felwood, azshara or un'goro, so it can be a bit crowded at those places. This way, I have it all for myself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>VoltageSpike</b></h3>This is selling for about 35g per stack on Dragonblight. Dreamfoil has become my way to make a lot of money quick. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>41568</b></h3>Still a very useful herb, even in the TBC era. I don't know what it's like on most other servers or even guilds, but in mine, we stock up on the Greater Arcane, Fire and Frost potions for Kharazan, rather than the more tedious Major ones, so dreamfoil farming is often a must.<br /><br />Azshara is more than likely the most exclusive spot you'll find, but it's still a tedious grind, no matter where you go. The plants are far in between, and the spawns aren't always on your side. <br /><br />Definitely worth it, though!<br /><br />*UPDATED*<br /><br />Obviously since the 2.1 Alchemy nerf, Dreamfoil and the prot pots aren't nearly as attractive as they used to be. I haven't farmed a single node of Dreamfoil for months. With Karazhan and other encounters where these potions would've been useful being nerfed as well, I'd recommend spending the Potion cooldown on more relevant pots to your class (DPS, Tanking or Healing).<br /><br />If you are still having trouble taking beatings on the bosses relying on specialized schools of magic, the protection pots might still be an obvious way to take some of the load off the healers, for example Doom Lord Kazzak would be an ideal place to bring plenty of Shadow Protection pots to take the edge off (Although I'd recommend using Cauldrons in that regard, rather than the old pots).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A plentiful herb with plenty of demand. Found in most 50+ zones and used in a ton of helpful pots.<br /><br />Kind of the exact opposite of the Black Lotus.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you got enough of dream foil, then you are not an alchemist.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's not so plentiful now that so many high-lvl recipes are in circulation. <br /><br />Both the greater protection potions and mana-related potions all requires large amounts of this versatile flora. AH not really worth it if you're in a guild, imo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>un'goro crater</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What zone has the highest % of Dreamfoil?<br /><br />Thottbot doesn't have zone herbing like it does zone fishing %'s.&nbsp; For instance, Booty Bay Fishing -- <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=4797">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=4797</a> -- has %'s of what fish it yields.&nbsp; So does anyone know the % of types of herbs yielded by the zones since it's not on Thottbot?&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm just looking for the highest % yield for Dreamfoil atm.&nbsp; From the amount of Dreamfoil found that's listed here, it looks like Un'Goro Crater, Felwood, and Azshara are the best places; but what % of the herbs that're in those zones are Dreamfoil?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Plenty of it can be found in WPL and especially EPL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Went to ungoro after reading post here, signed up to say that I came back empty handed.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, I've been figuring this out and, despite the deaths, it's still been less stressful than competing in Felwood / Azshara / Un'Goro / Plagues for Dreamfoil and / or Gromsblood. It's tricky, it's dangerous and it can be frustrating; however . . . I am dying less than I did before. <br /><br />DM EAST <br /><br />/eek <br /><br />Time to drive down the prices on the AH, folks.<br /><br />This can be stealth farmed for Dreamfoil, Gromsblood, Ghost Shrooms. There are two nodes each of Dreamfoil and Gromsblood in the lower courtyard and a couple Gromsblood on the way back out of the zone. Here's how you get to them: <br /><br />Enter through Pusillin's side (Entrance A on Atlas) <br /><br />I like to kill the treant that wanders to Pusilin because the walking weed drops savage fronds for the AD faction quest. So far I've received 3 fronds off of him each time. He's a caster and he roams so he may or may not be at the entrance when you zone in. Up to you whether or not to wait for him. Fight him somewhat near Pusillin or you may get aggro from the treant trio that also wanders that area. <br /><br />Hop down from the top . . . watch the pathers and the stuff that's below you. Not sure how druids will fare, but rogues will suffer 1400-2k damage. It's been that varied for me. <br /><br />Watch out for Warpwood pods. They do one of five things:<br /> Nothing, it will just open<br />Will be lootable to get Thornling seeds / Runn Tum Tubers<br />Poison cloud . . . move out of it, but Not towards a mob<br />Will spawn about 4 non-elite thornling looking things, either remain stealthed or blade flurry them down (use your thornling seed if you want)It will root you in place and do minor damage, not so good if you've got wanderers meandering your way!<br /><br />These will open automatically for all but the thornling seed. You'll have to gauge range. This is what killed me the most, bad luck + inexperience with the poison one (got poisoned too close to mobs and got aggroed).<br /><br />Some herbs are uncomfortably close to mobs. You'll have to decide whether you want to go for it or not: <br /><br />The single elite lashers are immune to blind so don't expect that to save you. If you do aggro one, I'd gouge, run a bit of a distance Then vanish . . . they hit too hard for me to solo (or it's their poison). You'll have to figure it out for yourself whether you can take these or not. I cannot. High nature resist Might make it possible . . . I died before I was able to collect much data as to how had they hit, etc . . . .<br /><br />Sometimes you can wait for the mob to move to its furthest point from the herb, distract and loot. Make sure you're at your furthest range from the herb to gain maximum distance between yourself and the mob.<br /><br />You Can solo the groups of non-elite lashers with some talents. A thornling seed can be used for a little extra dps. Evasion + Adrenaline Rush + Blade Flurry <br /><br />Be aware of the pathers that run across the . . . well, path. They're fast. They run the same path each time, though, so just use that patience thing and watch where they path and gauge how long you have to loot that herb node. Distract works well to buy a little extra time.<br /><br />Those are the issues I can think of. There Will be some times when you will just have to give up a node b/c it's too close to a mob. It stinks, but oh well. <br /><br />In my experience, one in every 6-8 runs a dusty tome will spawn. Out of the four that have spawned for me, two have produced the Shammy FR trinket book, Frost Shock and You, or whatever the name is, I'm not a shammy so I don't care, all I know is I make 45 gold off the books. =D Let me think of how to describe its location . . . SE wall of the CY, no mobs around to harrass you, but there is a warpwood pod you'll want to get rid of first. One of the sets of pathers Nearly reaches the area but you'll be just out of aggro range even if you're next to the book. Just walk along the east wall of the CY and run your mouse over the area, it's really difficult to see on my screen so this is the method I use. It will pop up on your tool tip thingydohicker if it's there.<br /><br />Now you have the choice of leaving the zone or going through to kill the singles and looking for chests. I Can solo the trios . . . I had to vanish after killing the ranged damage demons, but it was worth it. There are a couple more Gromsblood nodes on the way out. Some you can get to, some you will have to pass up or fight for.<br /><br />If you decide to continue through the zone, beware the stealthing demons, they will be in the hallways every time and then there will be some in corners here and there. They see through stealth, butyou can pop a CS on them . . . I don't have MoD and so far, even with them distracted, I have been unsuccessful at ambushing so cheap shot it is. They also break out of kidney shot early, my Guess would be that they may have an ability to do so, not sure, tho. Anyway, take it slow until you figure out where they are so you don't get a surprise . . . vanish is useless against them unless you can put some distance between you and it.<br /><br />It basically took me about 6-7 deaths the first time through and now I'm down to about 1-2 deaths b/c I'm still testing boundaries and limitations (i.e. whether I can take that single elite demon surrounded by his 4 little non-elite demon spawn . . . so far the answer is a resounding no - the main man died but his little demon friends made mulch of me). If I don't try anything risky I can go through with no deaths. <br /><br />Reset the zone x 5 and you can get up to 15 dreamfoil / gromsblood out of the courtyard alone. It's been a lot nicer for me than running around the other larger zones. At least I'm guaranteed these nodes will be up in DM, it's up to me to figure out how to get to them. <br /><br />Each of the mobs drops up to 26 silver. I've accumulated a decent amount of RC / Felcloth as well as grabbing some grey items and the ocassional chest. Plants are, logically, immune to the nature damage from rogue poisons; however, the demons are muchly susceptible. <br /><br />So, there you have it.
