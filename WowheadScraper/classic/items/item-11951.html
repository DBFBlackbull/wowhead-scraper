There are several different ways to do this.\r\n\r\na. Salve via Disenchanting: 1x Lesser Nether Essence = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=4107\r\nb. Salve via Gathering: 4x Fel Creep = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=4105\r\nc.

I have listed the four types of plants and links to where they are.\r\n\r\na. Night Dragon's Breath: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/object=164885\r\n- Requires 4x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 3-10 from each plant\r\nb. Wipper Root Tuber: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/object=164888\r\n- Requires 3x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 3-10 from each plant\r\nc. Windblossom Berries: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/object=164887\r\n- Requires 2x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 15-20 from each plant\r\nd. Songflower: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/object=164886\r\n- Requires 1x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will get a buff that gives you 5% spell crit and +5 to all attributes for 1 hour.\r\n\r\nI suggest getting a mod called \"Felwood Gather\" if your want to farm these. You can find it on all the mod sites and it's great for timing the respawns for you and mapping them out so you know exactly where to go and when they will respawn.","date":"2006-10-16T11:28:58-05:00","rating":132,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":1,"id":2389,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"3051","body":"These also have a separate 2 minute cooldown from potions.

You get Corrupted Soul Shards from killing normal mobs in Felwood. You can also turn in things based on your profession, for instance if you have mining you can turn in 4 Tainted Vitriol for 2 Cenarion plant salves.\n\nNight Dragon's breath cost 4 Cenarion Plant Salves to open, Wipper Root Tuber cost 3 Cenarion Plant Salves to open, Windblosson berries cost 2 Cenarion Plant Salves to open, the buff plant cost 1 Cenarion Plant Salve to open.\n\n--About the plants--\n\nThese plants have 25 minutes Cooldown, not approximately, but really 25 minutes. You can find 3-10 Night Dragon's breath out of one plant, and 3-10 Wipper Root Tuber out of one plant. And alot Windblosson Berries (15-20 or something). If your inventory is full you can pick them up but you won't get any plant. The plant will be despawned and you have to come back in 25 minutes. If you come back after 25 minutes you don't have to pay Cenarion Plant Salve anymore, you can just pick them up for free, but if you wait to long, or forget to pick them up after 25 minutes, it cost you the Cenarion Plant Salve again.\n\n--Great Addon--\n\nhttp:\/\/www.curse-gaming.com\/en\/wow\/addons-2446-1-felwoodgather.html\n\nThis addon is a great helper. Gives you a warning too, for instance: \"Night dragon's breath spawns in 4:59 Minutes in Jadefire glen\". You need this addon if your farming these plants alot. If you open your map, you can see the plants on your map with the cooldowns, these cooldowns are only showed after picking up a plant.\n\n--Extra info--\n\nThese plants (Wipper root and Night Dragon breath) have diffrent cooldowns! They both have 1 minute cooldown and can be used both at the same time. But in Patch 1.11 they are gonna change this, they then have the same cooldowns, and instead of 1 minute now, they have 2 minutes cooldown. A big nerf.

First, use the map that Rabieschu posted in the link below, it shows where the quest giver is and where these tubers spawn. \n\nTalk to the quest giver and receive the Cenarion Beacon, an item that you just keep in your inventory but allows you to see the quest items you need. You get these as mob drops in the zone, or you can do it thru a profession such as mining. You need 6 orrupted shard drops from mobs or 4 Tainted Vitriols from mining, not sure about the other professions. Mining was quicker b\/c I sometimes got all 4 off of 1 vein.\n\nUpon turning these in to the quest giver, you receive 2 Salves. However, you need 3, so you need to turn in at least twice. Then, using the map, look for the spots the Whipper tubers spawn. I could not find every one, so I assume that they aren't always in every location, but do spawn only at those spots.\n\nWhipper tubers will look like a head of lettuce sitting in an aloe vera plant. You'll see what I mean when you find one. I think they have a little face too. Anyway, a corrupted one will be brownish, these are the ones you use the salve on. Onve applied, the plant tuens green and you can loot it like a chest, but the tubers go automatically into your inventory. If you just see a green plant that's unclickable, then it has been looted already and is on the 25-minute respawn timer. Occassionally someone will apply the salve but not loot it, so check the plant with your cursor even if it's green.\n\nI've only looted 3 of them, but got 4,4, then 7 tubers. Expect to do lots of running around since there's only about 5-6 in the whole zone, each on 25 min timers, and other people will be after them too. It may be worth it just to camp a spot if you're only after 4 (and hopefully will get all 4 off 1 plant).\n\nGood luck!","date":"2006-07-15T14:36:56-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Sirarbee","importedSubject":"How to!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":28,"id":3037090,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"The plant looks like medium sized thorny roots protruding from the ground.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5213</b></h3>1) The first thing you need to do before you can obtain any Night Dragon's Breath, Wipper Root Tuber, Windblosson Berries, or Songflowers is to complete a quest to so you can cleanse them.<br /><br />Alliance: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4101">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4101</a><br />Horde: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4102">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4102</a><br /><br />2) After this quest is completed you will then need to collect Cenarion Plant Salve's to be able to cleanse the plants you find. There are several different ways to do this.<br /><br />a. Salve via Disenchanting: 1x Lesser Nether Essence = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4107">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4107</a><br />b. Salve via Gathering: 4x Fel Creep = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4105">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4105</a><br />c. Salve via Hunting: 6x Corrupted Soul Shard = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4103">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4103</a><br />d. Salve via Mining: 4x Tainted Vitriol = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4109">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4109</a><br />e. Salve via Skinning: 5x Patch of Tainted Skin = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4111">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4111</a><br /><br />3) Once you have collected several Corrupted Plant Salves, you are ready to start farming. I have listed the four types of plants and links to where they are.<br /><br />a. Night Dragon's Breath: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164885">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164885</a><br />- Requires 4x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 3-10 from each plant<br />b. Wipper Root Tuber: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164888">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164888</a><br />- Requires 3x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 3-10 from each plant<br />c. Windblossom Berries: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164887">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164887</a><br />- Requires 2x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 15-20 from each plant<br />d. Songflower: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164886">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164886</a><br />- Requires 1x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will get a buff that gives you 5% spell crit and +5 to all attributes for 1 hour.<br /><br />I suggest getting a mod called &quot;Felwood Gather&quot; if your want to farm these. You can find it on all the mod sites and it's great for timing the respawns for you and mapping them out so you know exactly where to go and when they will respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3051</b></h3>These also have a separate 2 minute cooldown from potions. Great for raids and pvp. <br /><br />Felwood Gather works really good <a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-2446-1-felwoodgather.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-2446-1-felwoodgather.html</a><br />It was the location of all the consumables in felwood with a timer of when it respawns. Works pretty good too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10467</b></h3>I just started collecting the curropted soul shards, apprently im pretty sure they have a chance of dropping off any mob in felwood. As long as you have the beacon and have completed the prequest.<br /><br />Oh and the percents are wrong, because not everyone has completed the prequest who are killing the mobs, i'd estaimate 20% off anymore or a tiny bit lower.</div>

I could not click on it, so I farmed mobs nearby till it became available. I did not have to cleanse it, just harvest the roots. 25 minutes later it was available again. <br /><br />Stayed another 25 minutes, and like clockwork it was ready to be harvested again. Dont know if its bugged or this is the way they behave until they are harvested out and then disappear (as some have when I've gone looking for them). Hope this info helps someone. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know if they moved the locations where these spawn?&nbsp; Only 2 places that I farm this at still exist, the other 2 (northern Felwood), don't seem to spawn there anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was in felwood farming yesterday and saw these all over the place.&nbsp; just keep looking and be patient, they are there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, I've farmed these plants for ages, here are the facts:<br /><br />--How to pick them up--<br /><br />You have to do a quest first:<br /><br /><a href="/classic/quest=1087/cenarius-legacy">Cenarius' Legacy</a><br /><br />The Blood amber can be found from the mobs in the cave in the north of felwood.<br /><br />--After completing the quest--<br /><br />After that you can turn in 6 Corrupted Soul Shards in for 2 Cenarion plant salve. You get Corrupted Soul Shards from killing normal mobs in Felwood. You can also turn in things based on your profession, for instance if you have mining you can turn in 4 Tainted Vitriol for 2 Cenarion plant salves.<br /><br />Night Dragon's breath cost 4 Cenarion Plant Salves to open, Wipper Root Tuber cost 3 Cenarion Plant Salves to open, Windblosson berries cost 2 Cenarion Plant Salves to open, the buff plant cost 1 Cenarion Plant Salve to open.<br /><br />--About the plants--<br /><br />These plants have 25 minutes Cooldown, not approximately, but really 25 minutes. You can find 3-10 Night Dragon's breath out of one plant, and 3-10 Wipper Root Tuber out of one plant. And alot Windblosson Berries (15-20 or something). If your inventory is full you can pick them up but you won't get any plant. The plant will be despawned and you have to come back in 25 minutes. If you come back after 25 minutes you don't have to pay Cenarion Plant Salve anymore, you can just pick them up for free, but if you wait to long, or forget to pick them up after 25 minutes, it cost you the Cenarion Plant Salve again.<br /><br />--Great Addon--<br /><br /><a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-2446-1-felwoodgather.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-2446-1-felwoodgather.html</a><br /><br />This addon is a great helper. Gives you a warning too, for instance: &quot;Night dragon's breath spawns in 4:59 Minutes in Jadefire glen&quot;. You need this addon if your farming these plants alot. If you open your map, you can see the plants on your map with the cooldowns, these cooldowns are only showed after picking up a plant.<br /><br />--Extra info--<br /><br />These plants (Wipper root and Night Dragon breath) have diffrent cooldowns! They both have 1 minute cooldown and can be used both at the same time. But in Patch 1.11 they are gonna change this, they then have the same cooldowns, and instead of 1 minute now, they have 2 minutes cooldown. A big nerf. If you use the Windblossom berries you get the +10 stamina buff instand.<br /><br />This is everything I can tell you guys, don't beleve the other noobs, I'm 100% sure about this.(##RESPBREAK##)908##DELIM##Uchur##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blizz sure knows how to make people cry...=p When I went to open a whipper root, it said my inventory was full. So I went to my bags and threw something out, but when I tried to click on the cleansed root again, it wouldn't let me and there was nothing to pick up. I spent so much time waiting for the spawn and just wanted a few damn roots for the voracity libram, not farming them like the million other farmers in the area.<br /><br />So anyway, bottom line is: make sure you have space in your bags!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whipper Root Tubers/Night Dragon's Breath are no longer on their own timers.<br /><br />They now share a timer with each other, and with Healthstones and pretty much every other consumable that's not offensive or a potion.<br /><br />If you're a Warlock (like me) this makes them pretty useless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>these things are great, they ar on a different timer then the healing potions.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>felwood gatherer addon gives you the locations and tracks the respawn time of the whipper roots (as well as the other 3 felwood plants). makes farming them very easy.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 6th 2007 1:10pm by Makenzie</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These are all of the spawns, they won't ever be changed. The respawn timer is 25 minutes, to cleanse them you either need to pick herbs or kill mobs and turn them into the materal which is used to cleanse the plant. You must have the Cenarion Beacon to be able to loot the material.<br /><br />There is an AddOn for picking felwood plants, called FelwoodGatherer which you can download <a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-2446-1-felwoodgather.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-2446-1-felwoodgather.html</a><br /><br />ALL of the plant locations: <a href="http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/4738/felwoodimgbillianbo0.png" rel="nofollow">http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/4738/felwoodimgbillianbo0.png</a><br /><br />Enjoy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There must be a different timer for the respawn <i>after</i> you pick the whipper root tubers. I have been sitting at the site for 3 hours and it has not respawned as a corrupted plant. Does anyone know how long it takes from picking it to it coming back as corrupted?<br />Thanks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>where do you start this quest at?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bullowski, you're missing one... right between the two pits by the ramp in Irontree Woods. It's very close to the location at the top of map, only a bit south. <br /><br />-Nah-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I wasn't positive how to do this so will share the info I've gleaned. First, use the map that Rabieschu posted in the link below, it shows where the quest giver is and where these tubers spawn. <br /><br />Talk to the quest giver and receive the Cenarion Beacon, an item that you just keep in your inventory but allows you to see the quest items you need. You get these as mob drops in the zone, or you can do it thru a profession such as mining. You need 6 orrupted shard drops from mobs or 4 Tainted Vitriols from mining, not sure about the other professions. Mining was quicker b/c I sometimes got all 4 off of 1 vein.<br /><br />Upon turning these in to the quest giver, you receive 2 Salves. However, you need 3, so you need to turn in at least twice. Then, using the map, look for the spots the Whipper tubers spawn. I could not find every one, so I assume that they aren't always in every location, but do spawn only at those spots.<br /><br />Whipper tubers will look like a head of lettuce sitting in an aloe vera plant. You'll see what I mean when you find one. I think they have a little face too. Anyway, a corrupted one will be brownish, these are the ones you use the salve on. Onve applied, the plant tuens green and you can loot it like a chest, but the tubers go automatically into your inventory. If you just see a green plant that's unclickable, then it has been looted already and is on the 25-minute respawn timer. Occassionally someone will apply the salve but not loot it, so check the plant with your cursor even if it's green.<br /><br />I've only looted 3 of them, but got 4,4, then 7 tubers. Expect to do lots of running around since there's only about 5-6 in the whole zone, each on 25 min timers, and other people will be after them too. It may be worth it just to camp a spot if you're only after 4 (and hopefully will get all 4 off 1 plant).<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The plant looks like medium sized thorny roots protruding from the ground. It's purple corrupted and green cleansed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gammapack</b></h3>Just an FYI to those farming up these salves and going for tubers/songflower buff/nights breath. I am pretty sure an unlimited amount of players can loot these plants within a given time period after they are cleansed. I use a TomTom macro to mark all the relevant plants i want to snag up and without fail i will usually run into one songflower or tuber that has already been cleansed and i can loot it for free. There must be a falloff time however because i also run into plants that i cannot loot that are already cleansed. Would be really nice if someone was able to confirm this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lilbolt</b></h3>Not sure if there is a bug but I cleansed a corrupt one of these and it did not spawn a lootable cleansed one...it spawned an already looted one...waste of 3 salves.</div>
