There are several different ways to do this.\r\n\r\na. Salve via Disenchanting: 1x Lesser Nether Essence = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=4107\r\nb. Salve via Gathering: 4x Fel Creep = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=4105\r\nc. Salve via Hunting: 6x Corrupted Soul Shard = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=4103\r\nd. Salve via Mining: 4x Tainted Vitriol = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=4109\r\ne. Salve via Skinning: 5x Patch of Tainted Skin = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=4111\r\n\r\n3) Once you have collected several Corrupted Plant Salves, you are ready to start farming. I have listed the four types of plants and links to where they are.\r\n\r\na. Night Dragon's Breath: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/object=164885\r\n- Requires 4x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 3-10 from each plant\r\nb. Wipper Root Tuber: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/object=164888\r\n- Requires 3x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 3-10 from each plant\r\nc. Windblossom Berries: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/object=164887\r\n- Requires 2x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 15-20 from each plant\r\nd. Songflower: https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/object=164886\r\n- Requires 1x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will get a buff that gives you 5% spell crit and +5 to all attributes for 1 hour.\r\n\r\nI suggest getting a mod called \"Felwood Gather\" if your want to farm these. You can find it on all the mod sites and it's great for timing the respawns for you and mapping them out so you know exactly where to go and when they will respawn.","date":"2007-05-20T12:37:11-05:00","rating":33,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":2688879,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Anyone know?","date":"2004-09-10T01:50:44-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"You turn this into lady elf standing off side of the road(to right)before the Emerald Circle(coming fron ashenvale).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>12938</b></h3>Actually, I skinned kills in Felwood, and got this without having the Cenarion Beacon.<br />For my Rogue, not really sure what use this Tainted skin is.<br />I think you need to complete the quest Cleansing Felwood, from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=9528#00zc">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=9528#00zc</a>, then she'll let you turn in the skins for the salve. You get XP for curing the named plants is what I heard.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>39842</b></h3>In fact, I just got one of these without having completed Cleansing Felwood and without the Cenarion Beacon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>49056</b></h3>i got it, i dumped it cause i didn't want it spoiling my bread</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nagrii</b></h3>Copied from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11951#c0z">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11951#c0z</a> and originally posted by gndn (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/user=gndn">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/user=gndn</a>)<br /><br />1) The first thing you need to do before you can obtain any Night Dragon's Breath, Wipper Root Tuber, Windblosson Berries, or Songflowers is to complete a quest to so you can cleanse them.<br /><br />Alliance: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4101">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4101</a><br />Horde: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4102">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4102</a><br /><br />2) After this quest is completed you will then need to collect Cenarion Plant Salve's to be able to cleanse the plants you find. There are several different ways to do this.<br /><br />a. Salve via Disenchanting: 1x Lesser Nether Essence = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4107">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4107</a><br />b. Salve via Gathering: 4x Fel Creep = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4105">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4105</a><br />c. Salve via Hunting: 6x Corrupted Soul Shard = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4103">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4103</a><br />d. Salve via Mining: 4x Tainted Vitriol = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4109">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4109</a><br />e. Salve via Skinning: 5x Patch of Tainted Skin = 2x Cenarion Plant Salve <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4111">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4111</a><br /><br />3) Once you have collected several Corrupted Plant Salves, you are ready to start farming. I have listed the four types of plants and links to where they are.<br /><br />a. Night Dragon's Breath: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164885">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164885</a><br />- Requires 4x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 3-10 from each plant<br />b. Wipper Root Tuber: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164888">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164888</a><br />- Requires 3x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 3-10 from each plant<br />c. Windblossom Berries: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164887">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164887</a><br />- Requires 2x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will obtain 15-20 from each plant<br />d. Songflower: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164886">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=164886</a><br />- Requires 1x Cenarion Plant Salves and you will get a buff that gives you 5% spell crit and +5 to all attributes for 1 hour.<br /><br />I suggest getting a mod called &quot;Felwood Gather&quot; if your want to farm these. You can find it on all the mod sites and it's great for timing the respawns for you and mapping them out so you know exactly where to go and when they will respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Saving a corrupted plant is 550 xp, can only do 1 of each of the 4 plants. Must do her first quest then you get access to the next quests that allow you to turn in these hides.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>horde members canturn hides at a tauren wandering directly east from the sanctuary in felwood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found her <b>west</b>, not east of the sanctuary. Coordinates are approximately 46,83 and the name is Maybess Riverbreeze.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have visited every noc named here and none gave me any quest. I have more than 30 of Patch of Tainted Skin. What must i do to get that quest? IS there a lvl limit for it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>54,86</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I also have a lot of these.&nbsp; I am thinking you need to complete the quest she has.&nbsp; I will complete it and see if she will take them then.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can heal the plants more than once. But one a specific plant has been healed, it take a while (about 30 mins) to reset to corrupted status.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>47,83</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>she is after you pass Morlos'Aran... on yr right (coming from ashenvale as stated above)...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ive been farming the beast in this area for a few levels (i grind alot) and i have 223 stashed away in my bank. i wana turn them in they take up to much room. im lv 48 right now. and do i get exp when i turn these in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i am not sure what level you need... but i got many of these before i was high enough level to get these quests.&nbsp; the drop and skins are very common.&nbsp; the exp was good for me, about 4200 the first time after each of the two quests.&nbsp; high rank ppl farm this quest to clense plant that can give mana back in battle w/o affecting potion timers, not sure of details.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Alliance must go to <b>Arathandris Silversky</b>, she is standing on your right side before you get to the Emerald Sanctuary, from Ashenvale.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You have to complete the quest Cleansing Felwood before you can turn in any patches or other things for salve.&nbsp; Once that is completed, she will give you a quest to turn in these patches (if you are a skinner, which you should be if you have the patches) for salve.&nbsp; The initial turn in gives you experience, but the quest is repeatable (for no xp i believe) so you can get as many salves as you want.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is only one quest mentioned here (above).<br /><br />The item says:<br /><br />Patch of Tainted Skin<br />Soulbound<br /><br />Stacks in lots of 20<br />Class Quest<br />Quest item in 4 quests<br /><br />What are the other 3 quests?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wha..?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What level does this start and can Alliance and Horde do it or just one side? I am a level 50 gnome mage and Maybes Riverbreeze does not have the &quot;!&quot; over he head yet for the first part I got 16 stacks of these Tainted Skins and would really like to turn them in hehe... if it is horde only then I will just destroy them all sense they soulbound but was hoping to do that quest for my gnome because I remember doing it on my Orc Hunter and having fun playing part of the Storyline<br /><br />-Cricket-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Maybes Riverbreeze in southern Felwood starts a quest &quot;Cleansing Felwood&quot;. The first step is to go collect 15 Blood Ambers from the warpwood elementals up in the Irontree area. After that, the follow on is to collect 5 of these tainted skins, and turn them in for 2 of the salve.<br />You get experience the first time, but can continue turning in tainted skins for more salves.<br />Once you have your salves, while running around Felwood you may see corrupted plants. Click the plant, it uses 2 salves, and it becomes a cleansed plant. Now click on the cleansed plant for your stat food. Also, you get 550 exp(at lvl 54) everytime you cleanse a plant, not just the first time.<br />First two i did gave me 12 berries each that do like 1390 HoT + add 10 stamina. The third one I came across gave me 5 instant heals in the 700-900 range. This isn't much you would think, but they are NOT on the same timer as heal potions. So you can use a heal potion and then one of these immediately after.<br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Mar 7 18:29:14 2005</div>
