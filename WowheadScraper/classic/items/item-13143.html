On the long mana intensive boss fights, popping demonic runes is not really optional. Talking about stuff like patchwerk, twin emps, etc. On those fights, 1-2 demonic runes eclipses the mana gained from this ring, so if you really need mana, you should just equip a real ring instead and use runes.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dropped yesterday on a warlords command run. We kind of forced it up to our druid (we didn't have any priest in our group).<br /><br />It really rocks in high-end instances (MC and above). A good healer doesn't get agro and will have this ring active an entire fight (general boss fight in MC is 4 minutes), that makes it 1056 mana.<br /><br />Hunters ? no way, they got way better altrenatives.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a caster ring, clear and simple. Warlock, Priest or Mage.<br /><br /><i>Why?</i><br /><br />All 3 of those classes have to stay out of combat. None of them should get any aggro if played well, where mages are the exception, but only a few times. But, the most important reason is:<br /><br />All of those classes <b>DEPEND</b> on their mana for <b>EVERYTHING</b>.<br /><br />The hunters here should lay off, they can do quite a lot without a single mana, whereas the caster classes can't do anything but wave a wand.<br /><br />Therefore, a priest, warlock or mage should get the first grab at this ring. Yes, a mage might have evocation, but that is a channeled spell (it can be interupted if timed wrong), and it has a cooldown of 10 minutes, which doesn't make it as readily available as this ring makes it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Priests, this ring is NOT a reliable source of mana.<br /><br />While most of these that drop will end up on a warlock, mage or (to the greatest extext) a priest, all of which i'm sure all experienced players will agree aren't supposed to become the focus of enemy attack at all, it does happen and in any challenging fight (where one might think this is to when to save the rings use for) theres guna be aoe damage.<br /><br />sure, priests can shield themselves to protect the effect, but rank 10 shield costs a whopping 500 mana and only lasts 30 seconds.. in 30 seconds this ring only supplies you would supply you with 132 mana and being that aoe attacks often come with little or no warning, to gaurantee the effect remains, your casting shield every 30 seconds. therefore, this ring is only causing you spend more mana and not supplying you with an enchanced regen effect at all.<br /><br />unfortunately, and regretably in consideration of mages there who also wanted this, i thought differently when we found in on wyrm. i wore it and&nbsp; used it religiously for about 2 or 3 weeks until, for the 500th time, i lost the effect of the ring as luck would have it about 20s into the fight vs one of zg's bosses later on in the instance. we ended up wiping. 1% health left on that boss. sure, 1% is nothing but even if i simply replaced with say, simply just for example sake, Ring of Demonic Guile (+6mana/5sec &amp; +10int), the one extra flash heal i would have had the mana for, GAURANTEED, to keep the mt up just another 2 maybe 3 seconds probably would have given us the fight, by a hair, but the victors.<br /><br />so what do i use this ring for now? ill use while we clear the trash, i love its effect for however long it lasts, feels like it totally removes my downtime. but come a boss, i take it off and put something more reliable on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This ring is just as good for a resto druid as it is for a priest.&nbsp; Druids perform the exact same function in a raid AND they dont get the shield spell.&nbsp; Some people might say that you can feral with druids so thats a different function.&nbsp; A. Feraling during a raid in healbot gear is a bad idea B. Even if you did feral in a raid wearing healbot gear then you would still need to regenerate mana so you could go back to heals. C. Druids can either off tank or dps during feral forms, both of these draw agro you would need the shield to absorb damage.&nbsp; I wasnt allowed to roll when this dropped because my group said it was a priest item. :( Oh well, grats to the winner.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im not sure if the other mages would agree with me, but this is my opinion.<br />i run with the same warrior, priest, rogue and shammie in almost all my 5 man runs, and raid with mates to top up to 10 for ubrs.<br />i would pass on this ring and let any of the healers fight amongst themselves for this. as a mage, i rarely run out of mana in 5 man instances and even in mc, i dont run out unless its its against garr. mages have mana rubies and citrines, which instantly gives us a big chunk of mana. if you learn to use these at the right time, you will add 1k more mana to your mana pool. we can generally take care of ourselves in that respect and lets face it, the mana regen isnt really gonna mean @#$% when each of our spells cost a few hundred mana, and are constantly fired(shammies mana tides have little effect on me).<br />i think any healer has the right to roll on this. i know good solid shammie healers and i know rubbish druids in full cenarion gear who cant heal crap in a 5 man situation. it all depends on how you play your character, and not the character itself. all the different types of healers have their own strengths, and are just as important as each other in the team. <br />i havent mentioned warlocks, but then they can turn health into mana so theyre in an even better situation than us mages.<br />as for the 500 hit point shield, ok its useful but i cant see it lasting that long in a 5 man instance or mc.... can you? and if it only lasts all... 5 seconds, thats only 22 mana to your pool :S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the ring itself isn't as good as it seems because of the damage shield. On average as a priest seem to last only about 10-15 mins before you get enough damage in a group. Also the effect doesn't stack with other damage shields such as power word shield. Which sucks as well</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Places not to use it: BRD, BRS, MC<br /><br />Just too much flame AE. Scholo and Strath works well when you 5-man, but if you zerg them, people seem to forget to protect the priest. ST you can keep it up the entire time until you hit the Hakkar event. When you can use it, it's excellent.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Primarily a priest and druid ring, probably hunter as well, and maybe also a mage ring. Warlock self-damage issues probably mess it up, so not them, and obviously paladins and shamans are too likely to take damage.<br /><br />There's a definite case that a mage will too often be called upon for AoE situations in which there's no way for them to avoid taking damage and thus will only occasionally get to feel the benefit (and plus they have evocation, mage armor etc for the occasions they run low on mana).<br /><br />Hunter has a good case for getting good use out of it- unlikely to be taking damage if doing their job right, if they do take a hit or two the armour has a better shot at keeping it below 500, the mana regen represents a much bigger proportion of their mana pool. If soloing and small groups figure into discussion, even more so as the hunter is the only class who could gain benefit from this ring even when not in a full raid or instance group.<br /><br />At any rate, I wouldn't blame anyone from any of priest, druid, hunter and mage who wanted to roll on this. Any warrior or rogue who wants it as a once-a-half-hour tiny damage shield should be blacklisted :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yosh, you dont use this ring for the crappy damage shield, you use it for the mana regen, give it to a priest while they sit in the back not getting hit much and they can regen a lot more mana and they have an extra 500 hp shield as a side bonus</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the shield this ring provies seems basically secondary. a 500 damage shield is nothing. that's like 2 hits if you're AoE'ing the supression room in BWL or something, and it's got a 30 minute cooldown.<br /><br />it *is* amazing for any mana using class who doesn't need to stand in melee range, though, for fights where you aren't taking any damage, since the 22 mp/5 is active for the entire time, especially priests and druids, whose gear already has MP/5 on it and need the mana regeneration most of all. chromaggus and nef are great examples.<br /><br />it's a waste for a warlock, though. a single lifetap is going to wipe that shield out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have full giantstalker and my regen rate is a measily 32 mana, this would almost double a hunters regen rate, and with the ablitiy to use mana and regen nearly at will would be godly on a hunter, especialy with our ablity to avoid getting hit. Unfortunately you'll never see this on a hunter (unless ninjaed), even my guild preferred to let this go to an alt priest rather than let it go to a main who'd happly ditch both band of accuria and quickstrike to get this.<br /><br />Personally I think it's kinda wasted on a priest since they often get healing aggro, whereas a hunter could use it 24/7 with out loosing the regen effect.<br /><br />Not a hunter item, but it would be awesome on one, unfortunately most non-hunters just don't undersand our class to see how this could completely change your game.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Aug 11 14:16:30 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm underwhelmed. It's cool in groups though, if they can keep the aggro off of me.. but I'm a level 60 druid, so I pull more aggro than the priests usually do. But I have a nice ring I can switch to when this one gets beaten off of me. lol. it's great while it lasts.. 22 mana regen in combat (plus other mana regen from other items if I equip those) is pretty useful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have this on my priest along with <a href="/classic/item=18872/manastorm-leggings">Manastorm Leggings</a> manastorm leggings. With various other mana regen pieces i can now flash heal every 10 second on zero mana. I have not yet got mindtap talisman, or the ZG priest belt, but will have them very soon. <br /><br />Oh, and what makes regen gear so absolutely essential for me is ... im a shadow priest =P so while i dont do any better at healing than holy priests, lots of regen at least allows me to keep up with them, and i still get to have facemelt form for pvp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you cant say its useless even if a warlock or mage have ways to regain mana. This effect is passive which means I dont have to click a button to activate it. Another thing is that life tap uses health and if I dont have enough health to do life tap effectively then why would I? You mention bosses have aoe... but usually a priest will also get hit. Feel free to yell at me for being stuiped. I'm all ears :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So I won this on my shadow priest who played healer on the run (before you critique, I am the only other level 60 priest in my guild and play healer when the main healer isn't on and have my own healing set which includes my Truefaith Vestments &amp; Hide of the Wild). So I was curious as to how this shield would play out when combined with Power Word: Shield. As I went out soloing, keeping my Shield on, I lost the buff. I am guessing the shield from this ring takes priority over other methods of damage absorption. Or perhaps the order of shielding is the order in which the buffs are placed (I put the ring on first, then Shield.) Can anyone else comment on this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>But I'd have to say that I think it's best used on a Priest, Shaman, and Mage could make good use, too. I don't know how much a Hunter relies on his mana pool, but it does seem easier to regen mana if you really need it and take 20 seconds out of a fight to FD and drink up. <br /><br />I'm a warlock myself, and although the ring is pretty impressive, to be perfectly honest, mana regen (and spirit) is pretty much wasted on a Warlock. Sure, it's useful, but if we need mana, it's a simple life-tap away. The way I see it, if a healer has this ring, I can convert the mana that HE gets from the regen on this ring, and he can spend it healing my life taps! m i rite? (Life Tap: Converts healer mana into Warlock mana) 500+ Mana/1.5 seconds is the best!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this ring is great for pvp. not enough mana though but its a shield witch is good for everyone no matter what you are i would say a warrior/druid gets priority over anyone else for this since they tank but if anyone else gets it great :) have fun w/ it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been using this ring for over a month now (actually have 2 drop back to back runs). Works well in any high lvl instance I've found so far (haven't tried MC / Onyxia which it would be useless anyways imo). It always seems to last around 15-20 mins and &quot;sometimes&quot; I can get it to 30 but that is extremely rare. I'm a priest also btw.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd love an extra 7920 mana during that 30 mins, just from the ring.<br /><br />Seems pretty nice to me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just wanted to clarify as a lvl 60 Priest who wears this on Mal'Ganis...<br /><br />It does stack with PW:S. I ran some tests with the aid of a friend and by using the rings ability and then casting PW:S on myself the attacks I took were absorbed by MY shield first and then the shield associated with the ring. <br /><br /> So as a priest who is usually in the back row healing anyway, I find it very useful over long fights and wanted to mention this as even if I draw some aggro my fade ability and PW:S typically buy me enough time to keep this rings ability running the full 30 mins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Druid/priest but im not one of those people that are like zomg epicz! Drood onlyz!. First off, as a druid we dont get shields there is that. Then in MC at least at least for me I rarely get to innervate myself. I usually innervate priests. So the extra mana regen is nice for druids.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yes the item would be great if only it added 22mana every 5 seconds... however there is a drawback and this drawback is you CANNOT get hit, acually can't get hit twice... one hit is OK. problem is cannot be hit by anything cleave, AE, etc. which means even if you have the best tank in the world this effect isn't lasting for 20+ mins. honestly in a non-zerg instance situation your lucking if it lasts more than 12. which than you switch the ring out for a different +stat ring and wait for the timer to cooldown.<br />The damage shield isn't a bonus its the main drawback to the ring....<br />but yes the ring itself is nice</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Perfect for Frost Mages that can use tricks like Ice Barrier, Frost Nova, etc. to keep from taking damage and don't generate as much aggro on average as other mages.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>acually the ring effect is quite good in BRD/BRS. with a competant tank that can just flip the AE'ers around the AE effect won't hit you. Also only not useful in BRS if the priest is mind controling the evokers... but other than that one can usually avoid the AE's of the various mobs.<br />scholo + strath also the effect is quite useful as there is no real AE. but the effect is lost on the scarlet side with the random charges that the mobs do there.</div>

If a hunter is in a raid and gets BoW he shouldn't run out of mana so for raids this ring is not a neccesity for a hunter but for healers its fantastic especially if PW:S stacks before it.</div>

I can see this being better for people that don't take very much damage or create way to much aggo.... I see this on a mage or a priest.... Not very many other class's this would be useful for the shield is nice but a priest can just cast one.... but priests and mages aggro like no ones business.... I play a rest spec'd druid and am constantly having to heal them and tank the guys off of them, and having to use innervate mid battle for them to still be effective.... this shield would last long enough to give me enough time to cast a heal spell on them before they die and the mana regen is very very nice as well, so I don't have to worry about innervating them.... but I can only really see mages or priests using this.... but I can't complain seeing someone like me a druid using it either! hehe</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>scidhuv</b></h3>As said, not too good because in most cases you will take the damage pretty quickly.<br /><br />That's not what I wanted to tell you though.<br />I've been saying from the start of classic that this is a lot easier than vanilla Wow, I played more in vanilla than I do now, but the epics are dropping like crazy. I remember getting Krol blade from a mob on my own, saw maybe 3 other world epics drop but did not win them. Now I have seen maybe 15 world epics drop, won about 5 and I have 2 (!) of these rings in the bank at this moment... (before you ask, they share a CD so you can't get a double shield :)).<br /><br />Aside of this I have a strong suspicion that the whole game is much easier, which is more the retail way. I guess the new Wow chiefs are also more the 'EA' type of 'how do we make the most cash' people rather than the 'how do we make this game the most fun' people. It's a bit sad really :(<br />I would have loved to see impossible C'thun for instance.<br /><br />So yea, anyone up for making the new vanilla Wow?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LazrChkn</b></h3>This ring is effectively useless due to how the mechanics for it play out. A few notes on it:<br /><br />- You must keep the ring equipped after using the shield to keep the shield active.<br />- You cannot switch rings in combat, so once the bubble pops, the ring is effectively a dead slot.<br />- Things like demonic rune will pop the bubble.<br /><br />The third point is what basically makes it useless. On the long mana intensive boss fights, popping demonic runes is not really optional. Talking about stuff like patchwerk, twin emps, etc. On those fights, 1-2 demonic runes eclipses the mana gained from this ring, so if you really need mana, you should just equip a real ring instead and use runes. The sole usecase I really see for this ring is as a dungeon aid during early phases before everyone is geared up for raiding and you get this ring by sheer luck during that time. In raids it is so niche as to be effectively useless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Melzer</b></h3>Its a Healer Ring.<br /><br />Aslong you dont take any dmg you get nice mana reg. but the 30 Min cd is pretty bad. <br />On CD its useless. Blizz could at least give it some stats</div>
