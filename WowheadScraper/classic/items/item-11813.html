<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7786</b></h3>Just a fair warning about these plans: The crafted trinket binds when picked up. This means that you will only need to craft one during the lifetime of your toon (it is also unique). I realize that a lot of people probably already know this... I'm just trying to save people some gold before they go to the AH and spend 20g on the formula.<br /><br />Other than that, the stats aren't all that bad. The +7 fire resist alone is nice for MC or Ony beginners. Here are the details on the trinket:<br /><br />Smoking Heart of the Mountain<br />Binds when picked up<br />Unique<br />Trinket<br />150 Armor<br />+7 Fire Resistance<br />+7 Nature Resistance<br />+7 Frost Resistance<br />+7 Shadow Resistance<br />Requires Level 50</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>47604</b></h3>Requires a Black Forge. where is that? might be useful info :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The trinket is Bind of Pickup, which means only you can use it...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The <b>trinket</b> is unique and BoP, therefore you can only make one at a time. It doesn't mean you can use the formula only one time, but you can't make another trinket if you have one in your inventory.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got it and sold it at AH for like 250G (Horde/Lightbringer realm), I was sort of amazed.<br /><br />The formula was definetely not BoP when I had it (yes the trinket that it lets you make is BoP) -- but seeing from the comment above maybe this changed in latest patch?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It drops ONLY from Lord Roccor in BRD. Im not sure but I dont think he is always there so its quite a rare formula. However I got ine last night and plan to sell it as im a Dragonscale Leather/Skinner.<br /><br />The trinket itself is BOP the formula you can do what you like with.<br /><br />Unique so as said before you use it once and thats it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think that people selling this for more than 20g is BS.&nbsp; As a 285 enchanter I check the formulas on the Auction House almost every day and I have NEVER seen the price for this formula exceed 20g. Never.<br /><br />This item seems to be in the auction house quite often, at least every 3 days if not more often.&nbsp; The ussual going rate on my server is less than 10g.&nbsp; Allakhazam.com lists it's average price at 50g, and I even find that hard to believe.<br /><br />Also the enchant requires the dark forge in BRD.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's worth getting if the formula drops for you or if it's relatively cheap on AH...like 10g or so(got mine for 8).&nbsp; Anyone who would pay 100g or more for this is either misinformed and thinks the recipe is profitable or gets their gold from ebay.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The demand on a server determines what the auction house price is.&nbsp; So if one persons server has the recipes at 20g on average that is probably considered a high price for it there.&nbsp; some servers (especially the very high traffic ones) may have higher prices on nice items like this.&nbsp; personally, with the recipe making only one trinket, i don't feel that 60g is really worth it, or even higher, but if you have the gold and want it, then that is determining the price.&nbsp; Also not everyone earns their gold by buying it from ebay.&nbsp; I know a lot of people who have a lot of gold and do not.&nbsp; They just do a lot of farming in places like the blasted lands.&nbsp; Maybe you should try if you are jealous</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm thinking about getting this and the mats, then dropping one of my other professions specifically to level enchanting and get this item for my druid.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I can just get the plan and the mats to make this, leveling enchanting to 265 would probably be the easy part.&nbsp; I'm already up to around 9k in bear form, even without a +armor weapon yet.&nbsp; This would be a very nice addition to my goal of 12k armor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the recipe is costing about 60-80g and the Blood of the Mountain for around 80g on Elune AH right now. :(&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It says Recipe, Drop, Trainer..... but i see no indications of where to buy it from a trainer. So umm ya... <br />Is it only a Drop?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey, Just a comment about the few who thought to drop a Prof to pickup Enchanting.&nbsp; I've been enchanting for over a Year and I'm only just High enough to learn this.&nbsp; Granted, if your already a 60, then it would take less time.&nbsp; But it's still a very costly Prof.&nbsp; Enchanting is the most costly and time consuming Profession there is.&nbsp; It�s best persued if you want to be a guild Enchanter and get the support of your guild to achieve 265 or better.&nbsp; You'll probably spend a LOT more gp and effort getting to skill 265 than this item is worth.&nbsp; Best to sell it if your not an enchanter.&nbsp; Or cut bargain with an Enchanter for an exchange of some high level enchantments on your equipment.&nbsp; But, with that said...&nbsp; It would be one heck of a end game effort and I'd applaud anyone who accomplished it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>selling for 400g</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The recipe drops from a rare spawn in BRD, meaning that he will only be there 1 in 5 times approximately. He can be soloed by most classes lvl 60 I guess, if you are willing to use a potion. I as a frost mage can solo him without breaking a sweat. I think I killed him 7 or 8 times getting the recipe 3 times. <br />The place he is in BRD is in the jail area, he wanders the corridors of the jail and comes through the big room 50 yards from the entrance. So the best tactic is to clear some or all of that big room and fight him there. So if you want to try him kill the two gaurds straight in front of you when you enter and stay there and look if he is in your instance, it might take a few minutes for him to wander past. If you see him start clearing the room, if not reset instance and try again.<br /><br />The person writing that getting enchanting to 265 would take long is not right. I started a new character with enchanting and when I wanted to lvl enchanting I just took my lvl 60 to an instance to farm magic items to disenchant. In that way you should be able to reach 265 in a month depending on how much you play :)<br /><br />Good luck hunting for this nice trinket, especially you druids.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I wonder if he will still drop this so often...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>60 resto druid in all tier1&amp;2.<br />Didn't break a sweat or use pots. <br />Didn't get the recipe but doesn't seem too hard. I don't mind farming him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The boss that drops this formula is also the boss that drops Idol of Ferocity.&nbsp; I'm 60 feral druid 14/32/5 and wearing mostly blues and PVP gear.&nbsp; I soloed this boss no problem.&nbsp; First two times, he dropped some crappy blue shield.&nbsp; The third time, he dropped the idol and this recipe.&nbsp; This boss is a druid's dream.&nbsp; He's easy to solo, starting as a cat, finishing as bear.&nbsp; He can be stunned with Bash, so save it for when you need to shift out for Regrow&amp;Rejuv.;<br />-Suraklin<br />Shattered Hand/Horde(##RESPBREAK##)264##DELIM##Thulm##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&lt;&lt;&lt; 60 druid with decent blue gear. Can easily solo him and usually only need to break out and heal once. Most his fire and nature damage spells are resisted at 60. Needed the idol of ferocity and got it on the fourth go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Saw 4 of these baby in the AH for 10g each... bought all 4, resold each for 50g.. 1st was bought right away.. the rest sold later.. neddless to say.. 40g out, 200g in<br /><br />personally, I dont think the twinket even worth this much.. mats n goin into BRD, you can get yourself a nice epic twinket with the 100g you might spend on this.. well, maybe the resists will be helpful sometimes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farm this guy on my feral druid. On my server (Dafious Brothrehood EU) the recipe goes for 25-30g on AH, on a bad day I'll get 1. On record I had 4 in 1 day = 150g for me.<br /><br />Just one thing, I suggest you take soem nightscape boots if you are going ot stealth run. The dogs are nasty for seeing you, and if you walk to close to the Fire Elementals their AoE effect unstealths you. It's a nasty run at first, but it gets easier.<br /><br />Tips for (feral 14/32/5) druids.<br /><br />Enter BRD, make your way anti-clockwise around the first room, enter at the 3rd tunnel.<br /><br />Wall hug, burn out dash where the patrollign dogs cross over.<br /><br />You should now see a hole in the wall where you can see lava, across from this is a hollow into a cave where there are lots of dogs. Fight Rokky in the door way.<br /><br />Buff up, and get ready to moonfire him, don't worry if him and the dogs pass at the same time. There is no friendly agro between them.<br /><br />Moonfire and go bear form, he should hit you for 150-200 DMG each hit, about 250 crits. <br /><br />Bash heals work well here, and be sure to use fearie fire. He also has a 2 sec stun and a small DMG DoT. <br /><br />You will prolly have to use Frenzied Regen and Enrage, so pack your Arathi Trinket if you have one.<br /><br />Loot, then retry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im not 265 enchaning yet&nbsp; but isnt it great to be a druid<br /><br />all i heard was feral druids soloing&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your making us resto look bad<br /><br />1.11 ftw&nbsp; who needs bash with swiftmend and ns&nbsp; of course just pull the fight out in bear and you will outlast him.&nbsp; <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------Druids, the class that can do ANYTHING</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found it in AH for 2g but im a 52 mage on Altar of Storms so I decided that I didn't need it..... so i put it back in AH for 35g buyout.<br />Happy hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1. Release the shadowlock - no problem. If you're 60 you can stealth there and unlock it without aggro.<br /><br />2. Stealth to the Chamber of Enchantment (location of the naga Ambassador Flamelash). Go to the far north corner of the platform overlooking the lava.<br /><br />3. Notice the island in the lava toward the location of the bridge and the Back Forge. You will swim there.<br /><br />4. There is a flameguard patrolling in the lava far below you, watch it's movements (you can see his flames through the surface and you can mouse over him).<br /><br />5. When the flameguard has gone far to your right, hit Regrowth, Rejuv, Cat and dash-jump off the ledge toward the island and swim straight for it in seal form of possible<br /><br />6. !NOTE: This island has 4-5 flameguards on it that you can't see from the platform. Therefore, jump onto the island at the edge furthest from them and stay there (this edge is on your side as you swim toward it - just pop-out of seal and watch the guards as you swim the last few yards). You should probably be 60 to avoid aggro.<br /><br />7. Heal up and get your mana back.<br /><br />8. See under the bridge on the left side is a slope coming up from the lava. That is your next destination.<br /><br />9. Now for the last swim: Reg, Rej, jump in the lava to the left of the island you're on - stay far away from the guards! - and swim to the slope. There are no mobs there so no problem.<br /><br />10. After this there is only one flameguard you need to kill at the Black Forge. You can take him!<br /><br />I did this in only two tries with no fire gear or pots (I didn't plan very well :P). I died the first time only because I didn't notice those flameguards on the island and hopped onto the island right next to them.<br /><br />The only tricky part is the first swim. It can be a close one to get there before you die. To increase my chances, I put on all the +stamina gear I had which was about +210.<br /><br />Have fun! Another Druid solo mission! We rule!</div>
