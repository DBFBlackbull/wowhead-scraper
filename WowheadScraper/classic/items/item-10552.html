I also got some good mageweave cloth and an average of 10-16silver per.<br /><br />Average levels are 47E-49E, and are really easy except for the fact that the Shaman heal themselves 1-2x in battle.<br /><br />Best of luck...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i'm warlock lvl 49 and get around 1060exp from them :) single pull and it's easy, double pull means death :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got my symbol from a Twilight Fire Guard. Any of the elites inside the cavern will do, so engage whichever one you're most comfortable fighting. You can't go wrong.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>for a warlock fear kiting them...rested xp for killing a lvl 49 was over 1100xp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Easy kills for an Ice mage. Just Frostbolt kite them. Make sure to keep Ice Barrier up and its always good to have Shatter in yer talents.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These mobs are extremely easy to solo as a lvl 46 pure frost mage. The thing is it NEVER drops :( I've killed about 60+ of those lvl 47-49 elites...<br />I gained a lvl though :D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These guys are out of Thorium Point, and to the right (west of the TP exit).<br /><br />When I first looked along the ravine, saw the nasty 49 fire mobs. Some 47 elite shamans in amongst them. The 50's are up on the right. Not a good plan. Scouted over the left hill (w/s/w direction from TP path exit)<br /><br />Nothing but the shamans, standing nicely apart. I guess someone may have been there before me, so what I'm saying is have a good look around if you think you're too low level and target the shamans.<br /><br />First kill went well, no drop. Second kill, lost pet had to flee. Second attempt at second kill, got the drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ever read those post, where it says first drop and you're like, lucky bastard. why won't it drop for me?... <br /><br />&lt;-- for once in my life. first drop.. cheer!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just did this solo as a 48 Hunter...Just draw 1 mob in at a time. I was 49 by the time this dropped though...took about 20 kills. Finally dropped off of one of the Dark Shaman. Bring food and drink...and use feign if your a hunter about halway through and let yer pet tank while you bandage. Alot of traffic through here for BRD and UBRS/LBRS so if yer solo watch out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Scored it off a Fire Guard, the shamans and geomancers are much easier to kill, just be sure to interrupt their heals/fireballs.<br />Fire guards were much tougher, usually had to blind and bandage mid-fight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I managed to do it on my lvl 48 fire mage. <br />I just pulled the shamans because they don't have fire rez. Dropped on the third shaman:D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>solo'd this as a level 47 BM hunter with the king.&nbsp; could handle two of the level 50 elite geomancers at a time but more than one fireguard was very hard.&nbsp; the shamans are easy so long as you stun them while they try to heal themselves.&nbsp; it took me about 20 kills before i finally got it off of the geomancer.&nbsp; it's really a lot easier than it should be. <br /><br />-Ravey</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im soloing at 48-mage fire easy as...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Located not too far west of the camp and Thorium Point, the elites have the symbol. It took me several dozen kills before I got the drop. Occational contact with the opposite faction.</div>
