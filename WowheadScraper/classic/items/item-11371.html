There is a black box looking thing.  That is the black forge.\r\n\r\nTo craft most items that require Dark Iron Bars, the crafter will need the Black Forge.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3118</b></h3>Dark Iron Bars require 8 Dark Iron Ore to smelt. The can only be smelted at the black forge. Assume you're looking at the bridge in BRD that leads to the entrance of Molten Core and the attunement shard. There is a short path off to the left. There is a black box looking thing. That is the black forge.<br /><br />To craft most items that require Dark Iron Bars, the crafter will need the Black Forge. This is the black anvil constantly circled by Incendius in BRD. HOWEVER! Not all DIB items require said anvil, try a regular one first.<br /><br />You'll notice most of the craftables are high quality FR items. One's best bet for decent FR without loss of stats is to make helm and pants and add +20 FR to each. The fewer items one must remove for FR the better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wait so to smelt the bar, u need to talk to the guy, bring him gold, TS, and star rubies, and u have to smelt it in the fore in BRD?&nbsp; and is a black anvil also there&nbsp; where i make my dark iron pulverizer. this is what im understanding.&nbsp; this is a lot of trips to blackrock depths. son of a...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yea every time u need to smelt dark iron, u must go to the dark forge. way in the back of BRD after the fight of the seven.&nbsp; its near the molten vore entrance to the right behind a fire elemental. smelting a dark iron bar takes 8 dark iron ores. then u must go to the anvil to make these thigns, which is in a completely differnt place.&nbsp; and i dunno. that dark iron pulverizer, the plans tha ti have are pretty nice. 8 second stun:no matter the percent, thats nice.&nbsp; but yea&nbsp; it does takeawhile, 20g and 2 tgrips to BRD later and im at 14 bars. almost there. im guessing ill get 75-100 for the hammer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you actually read and comprehend that its not EASY to get this smelting dark iron. Yes you HAVE to go IN blackrock depths to have the guy teach you and YES you HAVE to go IN blackrock depths to actually smelt it. The previous post said a NAMED npc teaches you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can see deposits of dark iron on your minimap before ever learning to smelt the stuff.&nbsp; I have 2 stacks of it (in 2 trips to BRD) most of it mined from ore deposits, and I haven't yet learned to smelt it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's not about the weapons. It's about the resists on the armor. Between the legs, bracer, chest, shoulders and waist, the total fire resist is +101. I'm not sure if gloves and boots are out there, but if so, the plus to fire resist is pretty large. That combined with armor rating that doesn't totally suck can make this set desirable to some. The weapons were likely included by the devs as candy for those who would cry about there being nothing available to weaponsmith with the dark iron ore. Fire resistance will be important for trips to MC i'm sure. As in other games, the zones and the drops and gear obtained in those zones are designed to help the characters advance to the next higher tiers. It's rather pointless to say that it's not the best armor or weapons when it obviously doesn't come from the highest difficulty instance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So we talked A LOT about the Forge and smelting, but where is the guy(Gloom'rel) who teached u how to smelt?<br />Is he inside the Bar, where we kill Ribbly? plz tell me!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where can I get Dark Iron?<br />-Only in BRD can you find these Veins<br /><br />Where do I learn to smelt Dark Iron?<br />-Gloom'rel will teach you how.&nbsp; You can find him in BRD.&nbsp; After you exit the bar, head down the steps and take the first left, which is Flamelash's room.&nbsp; Contine on past him and through the next room until you come to a tomb with 7 ghost.&nbsp; Gloom'rel is one of the ghosts.<br /><br />Where can I make Dark Iron Bars?<br />-The dark forge is after the tomb where you talked to Gloom'rel.&nbsp; You will have to defeat the 7 guardians every time to get to the forge.&nbsp; After you exit the tomb, you'll see a fire elemental on your right... kill it and you'll find the forge along the wall behind him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, lets say you've never looked at Dark Iron Ore before. You have mining as a skill and also blacksmithing (Weaponsmithing/Armorsmithing doesnt matter which). You want to start gathering Dark Iron Ore. <br /><br />A few notes about the ore itself:<br />1. Blacrock Depths and Molten Core are the ONLY instances in the game in which it can be gathered.<br />2. The ore deposits will show up on you're minimap just as any other ore will.<br />3. You need to have mining skilled up to at least 230 to mine (heirgo smelt) the ore.<br /><br />Blackrock depths is special because dark iron ore is completely bound to it. To smelt it you need to give 20 Gold Bars, 2 Star Rubies and 10 Truesilver bars to Gloom'rel in the 7 ghosts room, then you fight 7 elites and he will teach you how to smelt it.<br /><br />Great so now you know how to break the ore down into bars, only there are a few problems:<br /><br />1. To make one bar of dark iron you need 8 dark iron ore.<br />2. You need to smelt it at the black forge, located close to the Molten Core raid instance deep within BRD.<br /><br />To make Dark Iron items with you bars requires dark iron plans that either:<br />1.Drop randomly in BRD, or...<br />2.Can be bought from Lokthos Darkbargainer once you attain exalted with the Thorium Brotherhood.<br /><br />To make said Dark Iron items requires you to work at the Dark Anvil which is located in the centre of the instance near where Lord Incendius spawns.<br /><br />All that being said: HAVE FUN.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lvl 60 rogue (me) soloed it all the way way to flamelash (stealthed) went past flamelash and into the room with the ghosts. i quickly flicked back 2 this page :) to check which guy teaches you. And there he was, Gloom 'rel. So i saw that little pot next 2 him and put the stuff in there, and hay presto. He taught me to smelt the ore into bars. Then i used my hearthstone....... simple</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, I'm practically tripping over dark iron veins in burning steppes, and there are some in searing gorge... After 1.7.0 patch it seems</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Want an easy way to smelt Dark Iron?<br />for rogues and druids only:take a friend with u thats a roue or druid, u'll need the largest healing potion.<br />Stealth thru the bar out the back door to where ambassador flamelash is at, go behind him to the left side. Run and jump off the edge,into the lava,(heres where u'll need one of ur large healing potions),swim to the big rock left side of it. theres about 4 fire elemntals there, u can stand on the edge of the rock. they wont bother u im 59 rogue.after ure completly healed make ur way towards the other side of the rock facing the bridge.its a short distance to a ramp thats under the brdige on the left hand side. Bandage urself and go fight 1 54 or 55 elite elemental guarding the black forge.now u can smelt ur dark iron.u can also use this method to get ur attunement to the core quest done by urself. The fragment u need is on the other side of the brdige b4 the MC instance, looks like a mining vein thats like 10 ft. tall. GL. Im on the server Silvermoon and my rogues name is Vincentt if u have any questions. Ive done this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You don't need to be able to smelt Dark Iron Ore to mine DI - you can mine without having the ability to smelt.<br /><br />When you have all the stuff, 2 Star Ruby, 10 Truesilver Bars &amp; 20 Gold Bars, Gloom'rel will request that you make a sacrifice.&nbsp; A ghostly brazier will appear next to him, you click that and learn how to smelt Dark Iron.&nbsp; Once you have learned this, you will not have to re-learn the recipe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I brought the stuff to table next to that guy in BRB.<br />But before i talk to him he attack us, so i havn't complete the quest.<br /><br />Need i deliver the things again or just talk to the guy is enough?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No - you dont have to have bs to smelt - you learn it just like smelting any other mineral - smelting is part of mining - not smithing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A lot of you are trying to correct previous posters and saying that it is also in Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes. It should be noted that this was added in a patch a few months ago. It used to be you could only find the ore in BRD and MC. They then added the viens to Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, here is my situation, I would appreicate any advice, ( 60 Pally). Made to the Ghost Room and gave my offering, even saw in the chat box where it said I learned to smelt Dark Iron.&nbsp; I can make it to the forge but can't figure out how to smelt the dang stuff!&nbsp; I'm a Blacksmith so I smelt all the time but the option doesn't appear?&nbsp; I also got the Core Fragment and attuned but when I try to use it, it says Instance not Available.&nbsp; I was really bummmed, worked on gathering the ore for three weeks and then finally got to the forge with a backpack full or ore!&nbsp; NADA.&nbsp; Please, a little help would be greatly appreciated.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, first of all, getting attuned has nothing to do with smelting it...to the left of the bridge where the MC instance portal is, there is another small bridge going to the left. That is where the forge is. It is guarded by one or two fire elementals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it takes 8 dark iron ore to make 1 dark iron bar right? im pretty sure im right but i just want to make sure of this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The bars can be created solo by a rogue, will just cost you max. 2 greater fire protection potions depending your equipment.<br /><br />(Btw i'm fully blue equipped by far nothing special)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~vennis/wow/darkiron.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xs4all.nl/~vennis/wow/darkiron.html</a><br /><br />a complete movie.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After you talk to him, a bowl appears on the ground.&nbsp; Click the bowl and it will ask you for 10 truesilver bars, 20 gold bars, and 2 star rubies.&nbsp; Complete that quest (just turn them in) and then talk to Grom again.&nbsp; He will then teach you how to smelt DI.</div>
