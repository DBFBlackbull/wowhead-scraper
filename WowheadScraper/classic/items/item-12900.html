It's located inside Andorhal's town hall, as stated in the quest, amongst a bunch of Musty Tomes.<br /><br />You must open a Musty Tome and hope that you find that this book is the one you're looking for. If you open the wrong one, you discover it's a trap and one to two ghouls spawn to thwart you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8337</b></h3>You were absolutely correct, brianjz. The correct tome is actually white paged. The others are darker paged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10561</b></h3>The models used by fake and real book are still different as shown in the &quot;screenshot&quot;. However, if you have set your texture details to &quot;low&quot; (in video options), it can be hard to tell the difference, since the pages of the book just look blurred.<br /><br />It should also be noted, that there is no guarantee that a real book actually exists. Last time I completed the quest, I had to open 7 fake books, before a real book actually spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9498</b></h3>I turned up textures to high and still couldn't see any difference. I'd just say systematically open all the books sequentially until you get the right one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7360</b></h3>I would like to confirm that the book is completely white from the sides. I had to keep looting the ruined books until the required book spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>18561</b></h3>I just completed this, and I can confirm that the book does look different. I have most of my settings on low, and could still tell a difference when I saw the tome.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>15292</b></h3>The book is single toned, the fake books have pages that are white and dark<br /><br />the real book has all white pages, easy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>14507</b></h3>The book is like 10x brighter than the others. You have to open the wrong books and wait for them to respawn in same location.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>plasmasnakemg</b></h3>I can 100% confirm that the real book definitely looks different from all of the other books, I just did the quest not 2 minutes ago.<br /><br />First and foremost, the fake books are indeed all bottom half white pages and top half gray pages.<br /><br />Secondly, the fake book pages look to be a lower texture resolution. They don't look like actual pages if that makes any sense. The real book's pages will look like pages are supposed to look. When you see it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.<br /><br />And be sure to hover your mouse over the books to light them up some, the room is rather dark. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4854</b></h3>it is true that the real book does look different but it doesn't mean it's always there, i had to clear the whole room of books and all were fake, if it's not already there you have to open up some fake ones to allow it to spawn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deadlykris</b></h3>Just did this quest today and got the Annals from a supposedly &quot;bad&quot; book - so the trick does NOT work anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>28407</b></h3>what a quest, cost me 1g repairs and 20 flash powder, after 30 tries didnt see a book that looks other than rest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>krimsinkourier</b></h3>I just did the quest, and the texture trick worked for me, im running a nvidia card so there may be a difference between ATI &amp; Nvidia as far as the textures are concerned. one note tho, the book was not popped when i went into the room initially, i had to open a few of the trapped ones in order for the real one to spawn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>49444</b></h3>sure the tome are all white pages but i had to loot like 10 tomes before the right one spawned they where all 2 colored (sorry for the bag english...)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>16419</b></h3>Don't waste your time doing this quest...............After opening 30+ Tomes and killing 40+ Decrepit Guardians still no Book. What adds insult to injury is you don't get XP for the mobs killed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just sneaked in the Town Hall and started to open the books, I held the cursor over the stealthbutton, and att the same time the castbar was filled and he looted the book did I stealth, the mobs spawned but didn't see me cause I was in stealth mode. After the third book I found what I searched =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Confirmed:&nbsp; Book With All White Pages is the CORRECT one.<br /><br />--Do not open the half black half white-paged books.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Although I don't really need that quest anymore it has bothered me ever since I first tried it and couldn't do it because it was bugged. So today on the way to Scholo I decided to do this.<br /><br />Went into the Townhall (dying there - as planed), used soulstone and took a CLOSE look at the books.<br />They all have pages colored in black (top half) and white (bottom half) - except for one.<br /><br />Opened that one. Annals of Darrowshire. kthxbai.<br /><br />Easy thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of Patch 1.8.0 the book is IN the house guarded by the 2x 4 Undead Squads...<br /><br />Stealthers can Stealth thier way in...<br />Hunters can send pet onto the enemy, run in and feign death... if it works they ignore you...<br /><br />The book in question DO look diffrent from the rest of the books just as mentioned....<br /><br />All darker pages... look at the books they all look the same, then find the one that does not look that way and bam there it is...<br /><br />I feel sorry for those who need to fight their way in and try to solo...Gonna be a hard match..<br /><br /> lanzelordt said cordinates 43,69 had the book and I totaly agree, thats exactly where I found it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>for me all the books have top dark and bottom white. There is no book that is all white even after hovering over them. I have found though that if you are a rogue, after you open the tomb, if you see a mob appear quickly go into stealth. you will be afflicted with a musty tomb trap for 1 minute. after the minute expires the ghoul will just automatically die so you wont have to fight anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got around from the back right....walked on the ledge of the building ang got in without agroing anything. I got the archives in the 2nd book i ve opened</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a priest I just looted, if wrong book I just shacklerd and waited until the trap is gone and continues looking for it. Bad thing is that u get no loot or XP during the Q</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If yur unlucky, the book has been looted recently and not spawned yet. Then all the books will look the same! (Call for help to start opening the books so that the real one can spawn)<br />If yur lucky -like me, the book is there and you'll see that the top of the real book is slightly different. I say, compare the tops! It's a &quot;lighter blue without the blackish haze&quot; (not very obvious though) First trial, I got the book!<br />&quot;Light&quot; be with you!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks for the tip, worked the first time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>SURE the color trick works! I just ROFL to death! Just move to house, do shadowmeld when mobs come, go in and zoom into books, and still works 25.04.06! AND 0 mobs spawns! Then its just to run the hell out of there and deliver and get some EASY xp!<br /><br />NICE trick with the book color btw dude^^ tnx alot! u saved my computer! <br />Also did it on 1st try too...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bottom line:<br />Until the right book spawns, you have to open that bad ones-and you go through a lot of bad ones until you are lucky.&nbsp; As usual on WOW, it is better to be lucky than good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>okay, thanks for all who have posted the correct things, it helped me get it on the first try... To do this quest you must be somewhat patient and stare closely.<br /><br />Bad books:<br />-have the top half of the pages black and bottom white<br />-are darker<br /><br />Good book(heh):<br />-All white pages<br />-a brownish circle on the pages(you can see it)<br /><br />Thats just a re-cap of what has been said, and if I must, I will post a pic of the good book and the bad books to show you exactly what to look for, thankyou</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did it as a 56 priest first go.<br /><br /> The right book was not there at first, so I opened a few and it spawned, it did look lighter than the rest and the pages were all light as has been said all the way throughout.<br /><br /> Easy, thanks all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>read what you guys were saying, but when i got into the town hall, ALL the books were half-white half-black. after opening 10 of them and seeing no full white ones spawn, i started to get confused... have blizzard changed it so that all the books look the same now?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a 57 Prot warrior, this quest was easy if frustrating.<br />Go into defensive stance in the town hall, and if you can't find the all-white book open the other ones. The zombies that spawn automatically dissapear after a minute, so all you have to do is out-survive them. Spam shield block and you'll hardly take any damage, especially if you have 5/5 Imp Shield Block (you'll never run out of rage). I ended up just opening 3 or 4 books at once and then using shield block every tim the cooldown let up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I took a look at all the books, and found two that were a bit different.<br /><br />of the 2 that looekd different, one looked dark, and the other was fairly bright.<br /><br />opened the fairly bright one and expected it to be a &quot;bad book&quot;<br /><br />first try :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Look at the pages of the book, wrong books have half brownish half white pages. The right book has all brownish pages and sort of a tea-mark circle(as said above). It helped me alot, thanks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think part of the problem in distinguishing the books may have to do with the graphics card that people are using. On my portable computer with a 64 MB card, I could not tell the difference even when zoomed in and the book highlighted. On my other portable computer with a 512 MB nVidia card, I could easily see the difference. The pages on the good book were all the same colour although I would have said more brown than whitish. Maybe my video card needs tweaking :)<br /><br />Also I opened 4 books before the correct one spawned, so once you open a book, always have a good look at the one that spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We were able to choose the right book by seeing a small graphic glitch of pure white on the correct book, like 3 small slashes of pure white on the long side of the white pages.&nbsp; Both times when we saw this and selected that book it was the correct one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i found it at the furthes book from the stairs,&nbsp; an the window sill</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as posted before, i took a look at the books very close zoomed in, and it's true, the book i found the annals in had it's pages all brown. the other books are half white half brown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>12/30/2006 - all white pages book was the one. I tried about seven or eight before reading all the posts in thottbot. This book definitely looked different than the rest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>who ever wrote that comment about being only one tone THNX ALOT! found the book on my first try :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i managed to sneak past the 2x 4 undead group, lvl 56 so my aggro range would be pretty big</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Upon entering house i looked at each book closely one appeared to almost have a light shining on it, this booked looked the most inviting.upon opening it i recieved quest item. no monsters left building and turned in.. may have been luck :P<br />Good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of 3/31/07, the book ID method still works. Got it first try after reading the information on which book to open.<br /><br />As to other methods to get in safely, there's another way I haven't seen yet. If you come down the center road from the north, you can see a small Scarlet Crusade expedition. &quot;Pet&quot; classes (hunters and warlocks) can bait the closest Undead team over to the Scarlets; they can do the job just fine. If you're a hunter, you can even Feign Death and stay out of it altogether. Definitely helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It should be noted that the Annals book is not always in the building.&nbsp; Perhaps other players come in and use the white pages method and there's a percentage based respawn, I'm not sure.&nbsp; However, I can say that I've used the white pages method numerous times, having done it on 8 of my characters; I went in on my shaman today and all the books were gray and white.&nbsp; I had to open every one in the room, after which a couple of white page copies respawned.<br /><br />By the way... Blizzard, could you at least give us xp for killing the spawns?&nbsp; They're a total pain in the ass.&nbsp; kthx.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I believe all the books need to be there for the bright one to be gotten. I found it to be the book at the bottem of the stairs to be the one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have 27 ruined tomes in my backpack. All the books have dark and light pages, and i have been here for over an hour. i have opened all the books, then let them all respawn and no one else has come in.<br /><br />I am on the verge of quitting this quest. And yes It would be good to some xp for the kills. even if no loot is given.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wow this must be my unlucky day. after 15 ruined tomes, still no white pages only tomes. lets hope this does not take hours to get the right one.<br /><br />after 20 bad tomes, i got the annals from a black paged book, maby bliz took pity on me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just looted the Annals from a Musty tome, they are now on the floor in the town hall. You will need to search a few for it, but i got mine from one on the stage part</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Noyoki is correct. The tome that has the Annals in it is the one that is all dark on the sides. Most of the Musty Tomes are half dark half light before mousing over them. Though it is a random spawn within the room. So your best bet is to check each tome in the room before you start opening them. If one is all dark that is it, if not you have to open a couple to get the real book to spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there is a little trick, actually all books are dark and white (on the site), though the one containing the darrowshire's annals is all dark on it's side :)<br /><br />hope it helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The book was the first one i looked at in the town hall and it was on the floor</div>

Rather do something else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Looted 14 Ruined Tomes before it finally appeared. The mobs that spawn (level 55, either alone or in pairs) do several nasty debuffs, stacking up to 100 strength and 100 stamina loss, as well as an attack speed debuff. 44,69.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>They're floating in the air high above the ruins just north of the townhall. Out of reach.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>hehe got it second time :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Blitzar</b></h3>I don't know who wrote this book, but the war against the Scourge was the Third War, the Second War was against Doomhammer's Horde.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bloodvalor</b></h3>Just did this on two characters in classic on 5/22/20<br />The color of the pages trick does work!<br /><br />When looking at the books, if the bottom pages are white, and the top pages are deep grey / black, it will be trapped.<br />If the bottom pages are white, and the top pages are light grey, almost white colored, it will not be trapped and contain this item!<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />P.S. It is possible for there to only be trapped books spawned. In that case you still have to start clearing them out to get a non-trapped to spawn.</div>
