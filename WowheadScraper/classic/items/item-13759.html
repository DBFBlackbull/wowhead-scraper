<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sangre</b></h3>A good place (H) to catch these is from the river that runs directly through Camp Mojache</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>31850</b></h3>from WoWwiki<br /><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Fishing" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Fishing</a><br /><br />There are 4 separate intervals of fishing times. These intervals are 6am-12pm, 12pm-6pm, 6pm-12am, and 12am-6am. During this time the drop rates of certain fish varies, for example, Sunscale Salmon and Nightfin Snapper. According to experimentation, the cycle appears to be the following:<br /><br /> * 6am-12pm - Nightfin and Sunscale<br /> * 12pm-6pm - Sunscale only<br /> * 6pm-12am - Nightfin and Sunscale<br /> * 12am-6am - Nightfin only <br /><br />Nightfin Snapper has the highest drop rate from 12am-6am, but is never found between 12pm-6pm. On the other hand, Sunscale Salmon is never found between 12am-6am, but drops quite well from 12pm-6pm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>When the sun dial turns to night, you can catch Nightfins in greater quantities. <br /><br />You CAN catch these during the day. <br /><br />Fish are not based on zones or areas. The catch rate is the same as drop rates for items. You have to be in an area where they CAN be caught and have sufficient skill to fish there.<br /><br />I won't give up any information on where, when or how I collect these fish, but I will say I catch about better than 40 per hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm not sure about that, you saying fish aren't limited by zone or area. To the best of my knowledge, I have never fished a lobster, mightfish or squid out of a river or lake. The reverse is also true, I've never caught Nightfins or Sunscales out on the open sea.<br /><br />And sure, there's a chance of it happening, just like there's a chance of the Sun going supernova, that's not what we're talking about here tho.. we're talking about catching the fish reliably. I wouldn't advise anyone to &quot;just start fishing&quot; because you may not actually catch what you want in the quantities you want if you do. <br /><br />-Nah-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Nightfin CAN be caught in the morning time because i've caught 4 this morning in Twin Colloassas (sp)<br /><br />Also caught raw sunscale fish oily black mouth and a crap load of redgill fish, and some mithril fisi too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>have been decreased alot the drop rates? i cant cach they like before :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Are there schools of these fish anywhere? I fished a stack of them in WPL but they had a drop rate of about 10%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found the best place to catch these is the river just north of Fire Plume Ridge in Un'Goro Crater. About 30% of the fish I caught there were Nightfin. Majority was Raw Redgill, with some Mithril Head Trout and Blackmouth mixed in. Anywhere else I tried I could only manage about 5% rate of Nightfin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>People like Kempion crack me up.. go you!<br /><br />The biggest problem with 40+ per hour is having the mental stamina to sit there for an hour.. I know I fish for 5 minutes and I'm already bored to tears. If I ever sit there for a full hour I will report how many I caught. <br /><br />Anyways... I don't have a need to hide information from everyone so the places I can catch these reliably (meaning 1 in every 3-4 casts on average) is<br /><br />Verdantis River in Feralas<br />Skulk Rock (the river that runs by it) in Hinterlands<br /><br />I've tried Azshara and I've tried Un'Goro but I just can't seem to get the same drop rates there. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. 300 skill.<br /><br />-Nah-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>When I go looking for these, I fish in EPL outside Stratholme (while waiting for my group) or in the Thorondil River.<br /><br />It requires bait at 300, and my catch ratio isn't very good, but the other fish I catch are level 45 fish and can be passed to high level hunters with cats and bears.

Now, I have fished another 2+ hours and not a single nightfin to be had at Verdantis River. Logged another of my characters in and fished about 20 minutes in Moonglade area with no luck either.<br /><br />This fish is just plain BROKE or someone hates casters a whole lot! I miss my Nightfin Soup :(<br /><br />***EDIT*** Fish for these at night time ... have been able to catch them then!<br /><br />Edited, Wed Mar 2 00:51:42 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No idea what you are all on about. The best place to catch these is from the Verdantis River in Feralas. You can catch them during the day, but the drop rate is higher at night. I dont use a Lure, my skill is 300, plus 25 on my rod.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fishing in WPL near Andorhal I have just caught 30 in 30 minutes with standard rod and no lures (lvl 300 in fishing).<br /><br />drop rate sucks if you want to sell but for the Soup it is priceless.</div>

Their soup sells ridiculously well on Horde-side due to the lack of BoW (no pally ez-mode mana regen). Surprisingly, it also sells solid on Alliance-side, though not as impressively as Horde.<br /><br />In P3+ of SoD I *strongly* suggest getting cooking capped, a strong pole and 75+ lure, fishing up 400+ of these, making a ton of soup, and trickling it in to the AH in 4x 5-packsat a time. Depending on the realm and timing, you can fetch 60+s each (3g+/stack). Believe me: it adds up fast.</div>
