Go to the corner with the Tauren for the rep turn in's and stand in front of him. Use a bear on the floor right in front of you, one will walk over to it and pick it up and get stunned, kill him\/her. Do it again, until the two people standing at the bar have been killed. Then use your shadow protection potion, and stealth up to him. (He will not appear to be attackable, but he is). Use Cheap Shot or Ambush, kill him the way you would any other MOB. Be prepared to have the Major Healing Potion ready.\n\nTIPS:\nShadow Healing Potion - I would use this 2 minutes before the fight, so if he breaks through the potion, you have another one to pop, without waiting for the cooldowns.\nEvasion - This is a must.\nCold Blood - Use it on a 5 point eviscerate, if you have it.\n\nThanks.","date":"2006-11-07T21:18:41-06:00","rating":54,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2011-02-11T01:12:40-06:00",2,"OtherGuy"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":2,"id":10641,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Sebas","body":"This dagger has a great damage range for a pre-T0 rogue....beware the DoT proc though for it ruins gouge.","date":"2006-12-08T08:09:42-06:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Aye, the proc is horrible.","creationdate":"2006-12-10T18:32:25-06:00","id":286126,"rating":0,"commentid":10641,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"4119","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":3,"id":12944,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Wildarms1","body":"I loved this dagger 50-60, 2 rogues can stealth to him and take him out np.\r\n\r\nESPECIALLY now if your cloak of shadows, 2 dagger rogues is very nice on him.

Too bad it's not hanging from your belt like most other daggers. :(\n\nThough eventually if I ever get them, would like to replace it with Gutgore or Felstriker. :)\n\nEdited, Mon Jun  6 14:40:04 2005","date":"2005-06-06T18:36:19-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"PhoenixOrion","importedSubject":"Easy to do with 1-2 Rogues"},{"commentv2":1,"number":73,"id":3040079,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"got it 30 min ago :D took me 9 runs","date":"2005-06-20T18:15:59-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"javaa","importedSubject":"wow"},{"commentv2":1,"number":74,"id":3040080,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Vesania, why do you keep posting that crap in every single forum for every dagger above level 50?

However you can make some decent coin on the runs especially if you are a miner as you can hit 2 - 3 dark iron deposits along the way on my server dark iron goes for 9g a stack.\n\nThe easiest way as a rouge to kill Plugger solo is as follows:\n\nStealth up to the barroom at this point all of the patrons are non hostile walk up to plugger and purchase Dark iron Ale from him ideally you would like to purchase the ale when he is on the coner of the l shaped bar top that he paths, as he will stay in the spot you purchased items from him.  \nOnce you have the ale you will need to pull the 4 patrons that are at the bar away from the bar the two on the right side of the bar can be pulled into the side cubby where the dark iron quest npc is.  the patron to the far left can be pulled directly left along the beer barrels\/kegs and the inner left patron can be pulled straight out from the bar.  One thing to remember when tossing ale is that the closest patron to the ale will move to it so dont over throw or youll need more than 10 ales which is all plugger sells. the patrons can be moved using 7- 8 ales.  \n\nAfter the patrons are a safe distance away an plugger is alone on the bar.  Apply \"Mind Numbing Poison\" to your daggers this stuff owns plugger!  stealth behind him on the backside of the bar (farthest away from patrons) then \"Cold Blood\" ambush > Evade > SS > SS (if you are a prep build pop prep) Cold bold Evis > evade rinse repeat.  I generally didnt even need a healing pot to take him down as a prep build rougue.\n\nOther Helpful hints:\nGreater shadow protection potions: can absord up to 2000 ish shadow damage which is Pluggers primary attack.  Reminder these are on the same timer as healing pots so you should take them 2 minutes before you start attacking plugger they last 1 hour.\n\nWhiper tubers and Nightshade fruits:  \nthese are available in felwood via the plant salve quest and are on seperate times from healing potions.  They can provide extra health support if needed.  Before I went preperation build i needed these.\n\nEvade:\nDont forget too.  He hits for 150-300 mellee.\n\nCheapshot, gouge, Kidneyshot, Kick:\nNone of these work.  I am not 100% sure about kick but i have never been able to interupt with it.","date":"2005-04-05T23:00:32-05:00","rating":26,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"EXCELLENT tip, thank you so much.

Listening to jellybotswana's strategy (see above), do what he says, but this is how to do it alone.<br /><br />This may cost atleast: 10g<br /><br />First, you'll need the following:<br />Major Healing Potion<br />Greater Shadow Protection Potion<br /><br />(The reason this may cost at least 10g is because people mostly sell the Major Healing Potions and Shadow Protection Potions in stacks of 5.<br /><br />First, go up to the table and buy 2 beers off of Plugger. Go to the corner with the Tauren for the rep turn in's and stand in front of him. Use a bear on the floor right in front of you, one will walk over to it and pick it up and get stunned, kill him/her. Do it again, until the two people standing at the bar have been killed. Then use your shadow protection potion, and stealth up to him. (He will not appear to be attackable, but he is). Use Cheap Shot or Ambush, kill him the way you would any other MOB. Be prepared to have the Major Healing Potion ready.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />Shadow Healing Potion - I would use this 2 minutes before the fight, so if he breaks through the potion, you have another one to pop, without waiting for the cooldowns.<br />Evasion - This is a must.<br />Cold Blood - Use it on a 5 point eviscerate, if you have it.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sebas</b></h3>This dagger has a great damage range for a pre-T0 rogue....beware the DoT proc though for it ruins gouge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wildarms1</b></h3>I loved this dagger 50-60, 2 rogues can stealth to him and take him out np.<br /><br />ESPECIALLY now if your cloak of shadows, 2 dagger rogues is very nice on him. Ambush, and sustained backstabs make up for his high caster dps, just throw the bottle at him and keep him away from the drunks. You can defeat him pretty easily if all is timed right, as said before, Barman shanker's proc is awful, it ruins gouge's effect and just like deadly poison it's pretty sucky for sustained dps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>optimates</b></h3>The barman shanker is one of the best backstab daggers you can acquire in the 50's pvp bracket. The slow speed, smaller damage range, and high end upper damage make it ideal for backstabs. As mentioned before, the proc is terrible and ironically enough, makes it so much more difficult to pull a backstab off if it does proc. If you're mainly interested in pvp though, it's probably one of the better daggers you can have for the 50-59 bracket.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dadicus</b></h3>Add a +5 weapon DMG enchant to this and sharpen it with dense sharpening stone (+8) brings the top end DMG of this weapon up to 108, making it capable of hitting almost as hard as the Lobotomizer.<br /><br />Yes the proc sucks so I suggest replacing the dagger as soon as you can get one that is better for Ambush/Backstab... but it is nice until that time comes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>krisdl</b></h3>OK I see the guy above say you have to be lvl 58 to stealth in here but why would you want this blade at that lvl? Also I am lvl 52 rogue and I went in with a LVL 70 rogue, we wiped a couple of times because I didn't listen to him and that as simple as it was, after that I started listening and we got to drop on the first kill.<br /><br />I will agree, when this procs its a pain in the ass, but I havnt even got my dagger skill past 230 yet as I was swords and it was criting on 820 without any enchants and skill not fully pushed.<br /><br />I do like this dagger, seems blizzard decided to give the rogues something, then with the proc they took it all away again, it doesn't proc all the time but enough to make you very weary when fighting higher than you lvl mobs, before I would take my time with gouge in place to get engery, now I go all out with kidney punch and cheap shot and hope gouge works.<br /><br />At lvl 52 I feel quite lucky to have this blade, if there is anything better I would love to know about it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's deffinatly a drop by plugger, who is indeed in the bar located in BRD. You can buy a recipe to transmute fire to earth, some type of ham, and a type of drink from him.<br /><br />When you enter the bar, you will notice that all of the people are yellow, meaning they will not attack you. Go up the ramp on the right and you will see the plugger at the bar at the far end with 4 customers around him. Use the drink you buy from him to lure the customers away and kill them, then kill the plugger. He's a spell caster that does some fairly nasty shadow damage in the form of shadow bolt (he was hitting me for 300-400)... for that reason you'll want some shadow protection potions (greater if you can find them). He also uses immolate which can hurt, but isn't as bad. After killing him, the bar will turn from a peaceful yellow to an enraged red, they want to find out who killed their bar tender, so stealth and get out of there asap.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you don't understand what happened on 1.8, here's the drift.<br /><br />Your weapon speed reflects the damage it deals on instant attacks. Namely Sinister Strike and that sort. Thus, traditionally, the quick daggers were shunned over slower weapons. <br /><br />In 1.8, Blizzard coded all daggers as 1.70 speed weapons in regards to instant attacks. This does NOT affect the way ANY other attacks function. Only instant attacks.<br /><br />As a user of Shadowblade and Julie's Dagger (1.4 and 1.3 respectively, i think), this actually improved my dps. Some nerf.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok. I log in at 3am GMT to do a bit of grinding - RANDOM lvl 55 dorf rogue /w me asking if I'll help him get the shankar - I DO have the shafowforge key on this toon (unlike my main, lol) but I tell him straight up I want the dagger as well (mainly for ambushing mages - I’m sword spec atm but CS is a waste of energy on mages - so I’ve been using a lvl 42 dagger for ambush &gt;_&lt;) but that I’m happy to do enough runs as I have shadow pots - maybe more.<br /><br />So first run: it drops - we agreed that we would both roll on the first one - I roll a 16 to his 8 (damn we are high rollers ;p) so I’m haaaaaapy. (1.1k ambush crits sword spec is pretty tasty)<br /><br />We reset, go again (plugger dies so very fast) and? YEP it drops again. 2 drops for 2 runs :) /happy<br /><br />quick guide:<br /><br />Use the DI beer to pull the mobs away - one rogue use mind numbing poison on both weapons the other can use whatever - instant imo - the BEST thing is a sword rogue and a dagger rogue - the sword rogue pulls and holds aggro (add rush ftw) and the dagger slices away from behind – this way the dagger rogue can get an ambush in an everything :)<br /><br />I used: Shadow Prot potion (just a 'normal' one, not greater (3g per pot? I think not)) 1 thistle tea on the first run (wasn’t a good pull - didn’t drag the last patron back far enough and plugger agroed) - didn’t even need healing pots. <br /><br />So for a lvl 60 and a lvl 55 rogue - hes a piss of piss :)<br /><br />and barman’s is still the best /free/ blue dagger for ambushes :)<br /><br />glad I logged on tbh ;p<br /><br />Edited, Fri Nov 11 23:42:41 2005</div>

For these abilities it is on par with even the epic daggers like Felstrikers since its so slow but hard hitting. Due to its DOT proc though, its best used ONLY for these purposes, else you will find it interrupting your stuns or knocking off others more powerful DOTS in a raid (which they wont be very happy with).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>!@#%<br /><br />So, I help a 56 rogue get this, since I was only 58 at the time and I wanted the thing. After about 10-20 runs, we log and such. Several days and many runs later, he and someone else tries it. It drops, but he loses the roll. Several days and even more runs later, he goes with a friend and wins the roll.<br /><br />I, however, have never seen this thing drop even after running Plugger 30+ times. &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have now done it between 35-40 runs. No Shanker. I'm starting to think it's not on the loot table anymore, really frustrating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this a week or so ago. Myself and another Rogue in my Guild got it. I had the key, so we both went in stealthed, I unlocked the gate. We got to the bar. We each had at least 10 of the beers on us to distract the patrons near Plugger (had been to BRD a few times before this). Partner had Imp Sap, I am combat specced. He sapped 1 patron that didn't want to move, I sapped the other. We focused on Plugger. I'm artisan Alchemist, so had a greater shadow protection potion for both of us. Took out Plugger, he dropped the shanker. I got it. We went back out, reset the instance, and went back in. Same dealy, and my buddy in my guild got a shanker right after I got mine.<br /><br />Pretty rare for it to drop so fast in a 10 minute time span, but it's a cool dagger. Too bad it's not hanging from your belt like most other daggers. :(<br /><br />Though eventually if I ever get them, would like to replace it with Gutgore or Felstriker. :)<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jun 6 14:40:04 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Vesania, why do you keep posting that crap in every single forum for every dagger above level 50? No one cares how much damage one dagger does over the other one, they are just going to try to get which ever one THEY think is best, or which ever one they have a good chance at. I normally wouldn't care, but im trying to find a dagger to use when I hit my mid 50's and in every forum I see the exact same post, and your list doesn't even tell which one is best, it just lists the stats. Unless you have some info that people need r if your flaming another comment, or unless you have a logical reason to post, please dont. Anyways, does this guy have 2 people near him? is it possible to pull him single with ranged? If I were to sap one, how hard is it to kill him and the one? Any info is appreciated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>95 shanker runs?<br /><br />i got mine from the 5th run .. and at this time it was already boring as hell..<br /><br />i cant believe anyone di 95 runs, might take two weeks or something like that ^^<br /><br />this must be a damn unlucky person, had to laugh on that<br /><br />95 jesus</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone have any idea on the difference the nerf caused to their DPS on this item? I got it just after and it was a considerable upgrade anyway, I want to know how hard I should be lookin to replace it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Shanker is a drop from Plugger Spazz... in the BRD bar the drop rate for the dagger is pretty rare however it took me 26 runs to finally get it to drop. However you can make some decent coin on the runs especially if you are a miner as you can hit 2 - 3 dark iron deposits along the way on my server dark iron goes for 9g a stack.<br /><br />The easiest way as a rouge to kill Plugger solo is as follows:<br /><br />Stealth up to the barroom at this point all of the patrons are non hostile walk up to plugger and purchase Dark iron Ale from him ideally you would like to purchase the ale when he is on the coner of the l shaped bar top that he paths, as he will stay in the spot you purchased items from him. <br />Once you have the ale you will need to pull the 4 patrons that are at the bar away from the bar the two on the right side of the bar can be pulled into the side cubby where the dark iron quest npc is. the patron to the far left can be pulled directly left along the beer barrels/kegs and the inner left patron can be pulled straight out from the bar. One thing to remember when tossing ale is that the closest patron to the ale will move to it so dont over throw or youll need more than 10 ales which is all plugger sells. the patrons can be moved using 7- 8 ales. <br /><br />After the patrons are a safe distance away an plugger is alone on the bar. Apply &quot;Mind Numbing Poison&quot; to your daggers this stuff owns plugger! stealth behind him on the backside of the bar (farthest away from patrons) then &quot;Cold Blood&quot; ambush &gt; Evade &gt; SS &gt; SS (if you are a prep build pop prep) Cold bold Evis &gt; evade rinse repeat. I generally didnt even need a healing pot to take him down as a prep build rougue.<br /><br />Other Helpful hints:<br />Greater shadow protection potions: can absord up to 2000 ish shadow damage which is Pluggers primary attack. Reminder these are on the same timer as healing pots so you should take them 2 minutes before you start attacking plugger they last 1 hour.<br /><br />Whiper tubers and Nightshade fruits: <br />these are available in felwood via the plant salve quest and are on seperate times from healing potions. They can provide extra health support if needed. Before I went preperation build i needed these.<br /><br />Evade:<br />Dont forget too. He hits for 150-300 mellee.<br /><br />Cheapshot, gouge, Kidneyshot, Kick:<br />None of these work. I am not 100% sure about kick but i have never been able to interupt with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got the dagger on my 8th kill. the easiest way to beat him is to just buy 10 dark iron ales and use two of them for pulling each of the dark iron mobs in front of him into the room with the Thorium Order npc. this way, you won't get aggro by plugger and won't have to worry about potential links. at the time, i was using Lord General's Sword in main hand and thrash blade in off hand, and i was able to kill him with using a greater shadow detection potion and a Cold Blood/Preparation build.<br /><br />oh yeah, and after you kill him and the guys near him, don't forget to loot the dark iron ale and boar objects on the tables around the bar plugger hangs out on for some free ale to pull with for next time and some good food :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Barman Shanker is dropped after you kill Plugger. The 5% drop rate is accurate, as it took me about 20 tries to get my dagger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've had the opportunity to see a picture of this. I'll see if I can post a link in a little while.<br /><br />From what I recall, it basically looks like a broken wine bottle. It has a dark-purple texture to it, and looks rather subtle when held in the main hand. On the end you can see the serrated edges from where the glass broke off. <br /><br />Pretty wicked looking, with uber-awesome stats, but somewhat understated as far as appearances go. If you're into big, flashy weapons this one might seem a bit underwhelming. A nice crusader, weapon damage, or life-stealing enchant might help spruce it up.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jun 23 14:21:19 2005</div>
