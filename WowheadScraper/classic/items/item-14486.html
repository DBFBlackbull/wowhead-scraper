He spawns and patrols infront of the entrance to Blackrock Depths, at the bottom of Blackrock Mountain.<br /><br />This cloak used to be a bit overpowered becuase it was affected by +spell (fire) damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where is the guy? Is he in an instance or on my way into blackrock from the north. I am confused atm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>thx guy, but he never ever drops anything! i am really sad about that fact.... does anyone know?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dropped again, too bad no one could use it.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>LOL .. and I thought that guy was useless.&nbsp; I'm going to farm him now, just to have the pattern.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Now you said he was outside the instance so is he an elite or not?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>me and a guildie just went to farm for the pattern cause i had the mats to make the cloak, dropped on our first kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just curious what people think. Is it worth farming the materials to make the cloak to sell for profit?<br />Thanks for opinions...<br />@&gt;--)-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been here for 3 hours, killed him 33 times so far and he does not drop at 20% ... So far not even 0% ... I suspect its going to be like 1% of the time based on the other posts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Seriously,,.... did they remove it from the game? been killing him over 30 times now, no drop, and i aint joking lost count on 25 or something like that</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay so heres some good info.<br /><br />The drop rate is actual .02% -- simple math, it took me 50 non-stop attempts and it dropped once.<br /><br />He spawns every 7 minutes 30 secounds.&nbsp; The only issue is that you have a lot of mid-50s coming for a quest to kill the guy.&nbsp; I suggest inviting them to a group and just asking that you get the drop since they will have come and gone long before you get your pattern.<br /><br />Its a nice pattern, especially if you add +7 Fire Resistance, or +5 to all resistances.&nbsp; It helps to round out a good set of gear for Molten Core.<br /><br />This was a major pain and took a long time of sitting waiting and praying for the drop.&nbsp; If you need one on SILVERMOON I can both make it and enchant it.<br /><br />Good luck everyone</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just killed him and the recipe dropped right off. btw... he's easier to solo than incendius. hf</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When will people start to realize that 30, 50, or even a hundred kills are *not* enough to make a statistic? I see this everywhere: since a certain item hasn't dropped for you in the exact same percentage as the drop rate says, then there must be something wrong with the data. Well, it's not necessarily so. If a certain drop is supposed to be a &quot;one out of five&quot; thing, it doesn't mean that if you kill the mob five times, it will drop once. This kind of numbers will only take a meaningful shape after thousands of kills: our personal experience is a drop in the ocean.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well the pattern does exist, I just found this last night.<br />We just happened to kill him for a guildie, and I got this seeing as I was the only tailor there.<br /><br />Not much use for it personally, I just got an Onyxia Scale Cloak today.<br /><br />But if anyone on Terenas would like one of these, I can make 'em, just PST Faustblade (Alliance)<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />-Faust.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First kill of him ever, it dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>but not worth farming. as far as the cloak goes if you kill first boss in UBRS he drops a great fr cloak and as we all know that is too easy. just go in kill him leave reset and repeat. if your group know what to do you can do each run in 15 min. you will get plent of $$$ and other fun items aswel so it is a good way to spend an after noon if your guild is getting ready for mc</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ive killed him 3 times this has dropped 3 times..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had to kill him for the quest and the pattern dropped first time. After I started a nice (horde) rogue just came by and helped me kill him. (I'm alliance btw)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me 10-12 kills during farming. I'd never seen it drop before in who knows how many but I went to farm it and it only took about an hour and a half.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Solo'd as a 60 Lock and got it on the second kill right before my guild told me it would never drop and I would spend hours in there. Good Luck! OM Pyron is in front of the BRD instance portal. If you going to kill him make sure you get the quest from the Gnome near the Allie FP in Burning Steppes.<br />Posted: Jan 12, 2007</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was helping some guildies do their ONY attunment, and someone in my guild took over for me for a while, i killed him and this dropped.<br /><br />not even a tailor, which really sucks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Killed him while farming residue, and he dropped it the first time, but I was unable to loot it. Can only tailors pick this up?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Killed him about twenty times with my tailor...no pattern. Now i tried him two times with my non-tailor mage and he dropt the pattern twice...typical. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Did the drop rate on this change? Killed him a LOT of time and nothing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>but with my drop i just happen to have my tailor along ;).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>LOL I got this drop off first guy we killed on the way in to BRD, only one other tailor and I won!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>was running around after a lbrs run and decided to solo pyron, dropped this :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am pretty sure I got this out of the Knot Thimblejack Cache in DM N. I have killed Pyron 1 time, for the quest, and I know for fact I did not get it from him. I am 98% posotive I got it out of there....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I killed him on my way in to BRD. First time. Dropped ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lyariana</b></h3>I took a rogue and got it in 7 kills. You don't need to kill any other mobs once you're in position; just sit tight by his spawn point and he'll run at you. <br />Respawn timer is roughly 7 - 10 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tufte</b></h3>Easily soloable as PI Priest with 365 SP. I camped at the portal to dodge pvp-ers, and aggroed him when he crossed. Took 31 kills for me to get the recipe, so take the reported percentage with a grain of salt.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeloxale</b></h3>Arcane-frost mage solo farming the mob with ease. Took 32 kills to get mine to drop, and guildie took 20+ kills as well. At least I'm within the 99.9% expected range</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Frazlle</b></h3>Pattern just dropped for me, I have only killed him around twenty times or so.</div>
