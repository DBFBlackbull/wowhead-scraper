<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>we had about 5 of these things drop in ubrs arena before blackhand, of course being that the game likes to make me mad, i lost every single one...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>does it just drops...or is skinning required first? or both ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've only seen this drop off Chromagnus, and sometimes not at all, and the drop rates it gives seem inflated on here. I've never seen it skinned. also the AH sells them for 50-80g some topping 100g each!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>went on a ubrs run last night 7 dropped for us</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is it at all possible for a rogue to farm for this solo?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks for that ExplodeyTim!<br /><br />I scored the pattern before running UBRS and now know what it's like.<br /><br />Time to buy off AH &gt;.&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you are doing any of the quests that require Brilliant Chromatic Scales, it is not worth it to buy them off the AH. Since you will have to raid UBRS many times to get the Brilliant Carapace (or how ever its spelled) you will come along 10 of these easily. 2-3 normally drop each raid and people who have the quests get these first. And with me i only had 1 or 2 others in my raid each time that needed these for a quest. So it will take you around 10-12 raids to get all of yours and it is likely that the Carapace will not drop within thoes 10-12 raids since its a rare epic drop. <br /><br />Just my thoughts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a balance druid and trying to craft a Chromatic Cloak.&nbsp; I was in a PuG last weekend, one of these dropped and 3 of us rolled for it, but when the raid found out I didn't have the quest, I wasn't allowed to have even though I won the roll.<br /><br />I think this is ridiculous.&nbsp; I want an epic piece of loot, and so do the fools with the quest.&nbsp; I don't see any difference, we both need a whole lot of them and have to take our chances that they will even drop and we will win the roll.&nbsp; We were all prepared to have it count as our one blue, I should have gotten it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you are in a guild that does Molten Core, BWL, etc, by the time you get enough scales, skins of shadows, hero's blood, etc to get these, better gear will be available from your other end level instances.<br /><br />Be aware that getting the stuff for this does take a very long time.&nbsp; I got my Chromatic mail pants and shortly after started raiding MC and it's just not worth the time it took compared to the ease that better gear drops in MC.<br /><br />On the other hand, these scales can be used for some nice Dragonscale Leatherworking patterns which may be better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Seems like the drop rate has been significantly nerfed after the 1.10 patch, I have done 6 or 7 seven runs since the patch and seen 1 scale drop, prior to the patch i was seeing an average of 2 scales drop every 3 runs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im afraid now in 1.11 patch you cant get these anymore it is like imposible i wonder about the carapace btw it is in UBRS for all those that wonder</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>obviously i think the drop rate of the scales have been nerfed they drop half as often.. but ive notice that the chromatic carapace had been dropping a lil more often is it possible they may have nerfed they other items needed for the quest and upped the carapace.. i think so!&nbsp; Ive also noticed that blood of heroes takes forever to get its so freekin annoying searching for them since they are random spawns.&nbsp; One more thing.... if you plan on doing this quest get ur guildees to help you becuz it will take forever otherwise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Scales are down to ~15g on Khaz'goroth...not even worth the time farming for them if you have a carapace.&nbsp; AH FTW</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Carapace dropped for us today. 3 wars in the group (me and 2 others). we wiped after killing rend and gyth cause someone aggrod back door. then the %^&amp;*!@y fury war who kept taunting my target off me (prot) left without looting gyth, only rend. so we go back and me and the other warrior roll, i won barley. Started farming the mats already, i got 4 bloods and 1 skin, a scale always drops it seems so i will just start asking my group if i can need them, i still need Gyth's skull anyways...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got the purple drop off glyth last night, saw at least 3 scales drop to, only my 2nd run. I won it on a greed roll ahhaa.<br /><br />Now only need the scales and 4 bloods to get some epic plate! Go Pallys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We had 2 drop last run, 5-manned it with 4 70's and my 60 priest.&nbsp; What a hoot!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You always get at least one BCS off of Chromie in BWL. I generally get one BCS, and a handful of other scales (mostly 3-4 of blue, green and black) when I skin chromie. The nice thing is that since we are all epiced out, and it's a skinning drop, I get to keep them.<br /><br />My level 25 mage has nearly enough scales for her Chromatic Cloak.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Chromatic Whelps are suppose to drop Brilliant Chromatic Scales at 3.15% of the time, as well they are suppose to drop Red Dragon Scales 1.28% of the time. No Way! 4-7 Red Dragon Scales(RDS) drop per run from what ive seen. The Brilliant Chromatic Scale(BCS) ive only seen once (1x) in 4 runs. I think BLiz has changed the drop rate on either the BCS or the RDS. RDS sell for 1-2g each whereas the BCS sells for 60-80g each on Bronze Beard. RDS can drop or be skinned. I imagine the same for BCS, but not sure.</div>
