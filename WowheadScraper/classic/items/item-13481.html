The only place that you can get it is from turning in bloodpetal sprouts in un'goro crater ( <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=9274">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=9274</a> ) for every 15 sprouts you turn in you get a brown wrapped package and there is a very slim chance that you will get this recipe. The only other way to obtain this recipe would be on the AH for either a large amount of gold or a small amount if someone didnt realize what they had( i picked mine up for 5g after turning in over 150 sprouts, so it pays to check the AH)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>iammercy</b></h3>Don't bother. Find it on the AH or just skip it. I turned this in at least 30 times to no avail.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wolftusk</b></h3>Not only is this recipe hard to get, it also does not stack well with the priest's power word fortitude stamina buff.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tetris</b></h3>Only food/drink and weapon buffs are seperate from other buffs as far as stacking. Potions, Class buffs and buffs from quests such as Zanza's and Juju's are not stackable with each other.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got mine for an alt on the 6th turn-in tonight, 9th total lifetime. Two hours worth of boredom, but wasnt a total loss with an Arcane Crystal, Blue Sapphire, stack of Major Healing and a new stam bow for my warrior.<br />Gatherer addon made this a TON easier than expected. Well worth the effort.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this in the box the first time I turned in the quest - I usually never have luck this good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>An earlier post described a theory of gathering a full stack of each power crystal before turning in the sprouts. I thought it was a lie at first; it sounded too odd of a requirement.<br /><br />I was getting desperate after four days of farming sprouts, so I decided to try it. With the first turn-in after I had acquired a stack of each crystal...I received the recipe. Now, I don't know if it was the 4 stacks of 100 crystals each that did it, but it is a very strange coincidence indeed. It took quite a while to gather that many crystals, but the end result has made me very happy. Go ahead and try it if you get sick of futile attempts.<br /><br />Thanks goes to ArmedVermin and that May 11th post.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is this a Bind on Pickup recipe or a Bind on Equip?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been turning in petals on 2 characters for about a month, maybe 3-4 turn ins per week and still no dice. I don't really mind tho as I get plenty of other stuff. <br /><br />Last night it went on the AH for 55s. I'm not kidding. I got the name of the person selling it, and sent them a tell asking if they would take a gold offer of 100g for it. I was ignored or the player was afk. I sent a couple more messages over the course of the evening, raising my offere to 150. The bidding had gone up to 5g. In the end the player logged off without answering me once so I had to resort to different methods.<br /><br />I shot the bidding up to 50g to discourage some potential buyers but I was immediately rebutted. I then decided to set my cell phone alarm to beep at me every 2 hours at which time I would log in and check it. So far the bidding hadn't moved. When it was down to less than 30 minutes I shot the bid up to 75g and prayed.<br /><br />I guess I slept through the last alarm because I woke up to my regular clock alarm, scared I had lost the bid on this. It was in my mailbox. <br /><br />They should have taken my offer :) <br /><br />-Nah-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Apparently... after turning in many sprouts and no luck.... i stop back at the master alchemist in feathermoon..... and she had the elixir of brute force as a learnable pot.... i assume with the new patch this past tuesday, they made that possible. so if you havent yet... GO TO FEATHERMOON AND LEARN IT. for horde, i assume its att he master alchemist for you also.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just my observation<br /><br />I've done this quest alot (At least 1000 sprouts)<br />Nothing happened for me until.....<br /><br />I had a stack of each power crystal (red,blue,green,yellow)<br />and a stack of un'goro soil for good measure<br />I usually have about 60 sprouts when I turn in. <br /><br />ever heard how you need a sulfuron ingot in your bag for tha guy to tell you about the sulfuron hammer and how to make it.<br /><br />Brute force ~ Power crystal (figured it was worth a shot)<br /><br />THIS TIME! of the 4 turn in's 2 yielded a receipe.<br /><br />Might not be guaranteed but I'll bet the chances of you getting it are greatly increased with the stuff in your bag during the turn in/collecting.<br /><br />Haven't tried since learning the recipe. I doubt I'll get another since I know it<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Edited, Thu May 11 14:50:42 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>someone had it at AH for 2g buyout :) gg nub :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I honestly figured the whole kodo thing for a fluke, but now that it is confirmed, I may have to go farm some sprouts. <br /><br />For those interested, the Kodo is at Marshal's Refuge and it takes 15 sprouts for each turn-in. He then gives you a gift with 4 or so items in it. Usually you get a major healing pot, maybe a rugged armor kit, and some food/drinks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was lucky I got it on 1st turn in :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have picked up three of thes on my alchemist. I got my first one on my second turn in, I believe. When I got it I thought &quot;hey, nifty, I wonder if I can get another&quot; so I went on and got another in a couple more turn ins. After logging out that night I checked here to see what the average sale price was. 175g. I almost died. I saved one for myself and threw the other on the AH for 200g. <br /><br />After this I never pass up a bloodpetal and have recieved one more pattern, which I also sold for 200g. This one sold while I was still in IF. Unfortunately I haven't seen one since about November. I must've done about 40+ turn ins since my last drop. My drop luck has dried up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ive been turning in the sprouts for over 30x15 sprouts now, still nothing<br />Think ill just farm some money and buy it from the AH, costs alot less time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm an alchemist and want this recipie. I'm also broke, so I can't afford even the cheap recipe on the AH at 75g. (There are two recipies on the AH so I know it does drop for someone).<br /><br />I've turned in 20+ times now. I have found out that Bloodpetal Sprouts stack to 100, and I know the spawn locations of just about all the Bloodpetal Sprouts in Un'Goro Crater (seems that most spawn near Dimetradons--probably just a coincidence, but seems to be the case.) I even developed a pretty good route to pick them and come back around as they respawned.<br /><br />I finally got so fed up with Un'Goro and this stupid starving Kodo that I went to Southern Tanaris and started farming Volitile Rum from the pirates plus they drop money and although very low, the drops for Volitile Rum are MUCH better than this recipe. If I kill enough of them, perhaps I will be able to finally afford the AH prices.<br /><br />I'll update more once I get to where I can stand Un'Goro again. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First off, I'm not lying or trolling.<br /><br />I got one package, wondering what the deal was, and got the Recipe. I figured that was a neat thing, not knowing it was rare, and sold it for 200g. Pretty good price. Told my co-worker about it, and he was astonished I got it first turn-in.<br /><br />Next day, I'm questing again, and I turned it in again--and got another Recipe. Sold that one for 250g.<br /><br />Now, about five or six weeks later, I'm farming for thorium and I collect the Bloodpetals as I go around. It was probably another 75-100 turnins since my first two, but I just got another one and came here to check the price.<br /><br />Just keep trying.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me 67 turn ins to get it. Sells for about 300-400g on Suramar, but I'm learning it as I only lack 6 recipes to have all in game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No idea, my friend. But anyway, I was away for ten minutes and the auction had sold. And I was 260 gold richer, for I accidentally typed 6 instead of 8. 20 gold, argh, how can I live with myself any more? Seriously, I first got offers of 50-60 gold, and I was like &quot;Hey, I'm not THAT a good guy!&quot;. And now I have the three buyable pieces of Valor set, for my level isn't enough to go search them. So quite nice for me, who has hardly ever seen over 50 gold ickn my pocket. And again, good luck for anyone trying to acquire this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this on my first turn in of bloodpetals today. Had no idea it even came from them, was quite a pleasent surprise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK if this is so rare and I must admit I got this on the first turn-in of sprouts, so I wasn't aware of that until I saw the auctioneer price and reading this, why if my BO is only 143g does nobody want it!<br /><br />Edited, Tue May 2 09:42:26 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got this from 1st try.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this on my second time feeding Dadanga. Was about to auction it for 2 gold, but then I remembered I had made stupid mistakes before (for example sold the Blackfang for 6 gold, 60 silver and 160 wool clothes), and decided to check the price here.<br /><br />My lower jaw almost hit the keyboard.<br /><br />&quot;280 GOLD?&quot;<br /><br />I had never had a drop this valuable before, Nightblade was the most valuable of my drops, but I'm (still) using it, and Blackfang's only worth about 30 gold, and then there has been two rare items worth 15 gold each. So yeah, I'm darned happy. I hope it sells, so that I can buy the Bracers and Gauntlets of Valor. And maybe some other rare items as well :) Good luck for everyone trying to acquire this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes indeed you can get this from the Kodo in Marshals Refuge, but unlike some of you think you do NOT need a prequest or crystals in your bag.<br />Yesterday i handed in my FIRST 15 sprouts on my alt and got extremely lucky...this recipe dropped =)<br />So it all comes down to luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Now comes the quandry.<br /><br />To sell or not to sell. I probably wont seeing as how seriously handy these will be come BC in a raiding guild but still knowing that its worth a great price is kind of making me think a touch about the money :(<br /><br />LOL, no i wont sell it however when im down farming in ungoro im so going to be collecting the damn sprouts ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bought it for 1g on the auction on Steamwheedle Cartel. I don't know what the person was thinking, the other entries were 250g+.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>At least 15 more times. No recipe. I am starting to doubt this drop. Luckily healing potions, and the herbs in ungoro dont make this a complete waste of time.</div>

I was so pissed because I had spent 20 min. collecting stupid sprouts with what I thought was a quest, when really it was the same old turn-in quest that I'd done 5 times and gotten nothing but food and a couple of potions. Little did I know that I could get this recipe =).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does it have to be turned in with a quest or can you just keep feeding the kodo?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just confirming 100 of each Crystal is NOT a sure fire way to get the recipe, I just tried it with 100 of each Crystal on three hand in's and not one had the recipe. So this is totaly luck that people got it this way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Either it was luck or they've nerfed it since these people got theirs.<br /><br />I've got full stacks, and have turned in about 9 times (as has my husband) and nothing worth the effort has come out of it. <br /><br />Especially since I have 300 alch and can make the potions we get.<br /><br />*sigh* I wanted this recipe! So I will likely keep trying it a time or two each time I have to come to Un'Goro for anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kanuslupus</b></h3>Over 50 turn ins so far and still haven't had this elusive recipe drop. If I hadn't seen it on the AH once, and hadn't also actually seen the elixirs themselves in the AH, then I would be doubting that Blizzard had activated this recipe for SOD phase 3. Guess I'll keep searching, but wow, this recipe is a pain to get.</div>
