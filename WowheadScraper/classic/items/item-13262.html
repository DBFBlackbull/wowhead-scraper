The crystal was originally from Draenor and was a \"living embodiment of darkness.\"  However, upon placing a spell upon it, it became its polar opposite-- a manifestation of pure light.  The Order of the Silver Hand agreed to use the crystal to craft a weapon to be the bane of the Scourge: The Ashbringer.  (This can be seen in the Burning Crusade in the Southshore inn in the Caverns of Time: \"Thrall's Escape\").\n\n    * Ashbringer was crafted by Timolain, an Archmage of the Scarlet Crusade.  However, Timolain was secretely a member of the Cult of Damned, and this eventually became known to the Crusade, and hence, Timolain was executed (this is somewhat speculative).  Kel'Thuzad then resurrected him as a Lich like himself.  However, he was again killed at the hands of the Crusade, leaving only his phylactery behind (a phylactery allows a lich to regenerate himself over time if it is not destroyed).  A large vile slime consumed the phylactery and took on some of Timolain's powers.\n\n    * Side Note: Timolain's Phylactery no longer drops from Large Vile Slimes as of patch 1.6.  It may have originally been planned to be used in the Ashbringer questline, but when Naxxramus was in its inital planning stages Ashbringer may have been delayed as it would better coincide with Naxxramas content.\n\n    * The sword crafted by Timolain took on the name of its wielder, Scarlet Highlord Mograine, The Ashbringer.  His title is derived from his uncanny ability to smite undead; Mograine could slay them so fast that they would vaporize, surrounding him in a cloud of ash.\n\n    * Highlord Mograine's son, Renault was a young member of the Scarlet Crusade.  However, he secretly struck a bargain with Kel'Thuzad to eliminate his father.  Presumably, in exchange Renault would take his father's place as commander of the Crusade.\n\n    * During the invasion of Stratholme, Mograine easily pummeled through waves of the Scourge.  However, he did not receive reinforcements and was eventually overrun.  Even after dropping his sword, the Scourge forces were not enough to kill him.  Others in battle, presuming he was dead, sent Renault to retrieve his father's sword.  Renault instead took up the sword and drove it through his weakened father.  Such an evil act corrupted the Ashbringer.  Renault left the sword and reported to his comrades that it had been lost.\n\n    * Kel'Thuzad then resurrected Highlord Mograine as a death knight.\n\n    * Renault's betrayal was witnessed only by Inquisitor Fairbanks, Mograine's advisor, who was trapped under a pile of corpses.  A few days later, Fairbanks escaped Stratholme and returned to the Scarlet Monastery, recounting Mograine's cold-blooded murder to any who would listen.\n\n    * Renault had already assumed the position of Scarlet Commander at this time, and dismissed Fairbanks accusations.  Fairbanks was taken into a secret room (where we find him in SM Cathedral) and murdered.  Those members of the Crusade that heard and believed Fairbanks' story left the Monastery and formed the Argent Dawn.\n\n    * Renault is the current \"Scarlet Commander\" you face in SM Cathedral.  Fairbanks was replaced by High Inquisitor Whitemane.  Fairbanks was probably infected with undeath while in Stratholme, which is why you face him as an undead in SM Cathedral.\n\n    * During the scripted event (see above), Highlord Mograine's ghost appears in full dreadnaught.  He confronts his son, kills him, and removes Fairbanks' undeath.  Highlord Mograine despawns, and Fairbanks tells you the story of Ashbringer (which you have just read).\n\n    * Fairbanks goes on to tell you that the Corrupted Ashbringer cannot be purified-- the corruption is too deeply ingrained.  However, Highlord Mograine's other, more pure son can craft a new Ashbringer.  He resides in Outland.","date":"2006-11-09T13:25:33-06:00","rating":396,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":3279,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"5859","body":"Miscellaneous\n\n    * Ashbringer has been in the game files (and thus datamined) since release.  It's been a popular \"carrot-on-a-stick\" that Blizzard has held in front of player's noses.  Despite this, Blizzard remained silent on whether it was actually obtainable, leading many players to think that it could be obtained via a secret quest line that no one had discovered yet.\n\n    * On February 24th, 2006, Eyonix stated on the official forums that \"It's true that currently Ashbringer is not in the game, although one day in the future it will be, but not until after there is an awesome legendary item for casters. ;)\" -- a now obvious reference to Atiesh.\n\n   *Considering that many NPC's allude to the existence of Ashbringer, it is probable that it was originally intended to be in the game much earlier.  The development team most likely delayed it so Naxxramas could be used to flesh out it's background story, and give casters a legendary item first.\n\n    * Ashbringer is mentioned by several NPCs and items:\n          -Shendralar Zealots in Dire Maul will tell you that Prince Thortheldrin will reveal the location of the Ashbringer if you defeat Nefarion.

Yes, the father of the Scarlet Commander Mograine.\n\nTechnically, his sword was known as the Ashbringer but when people referred to the High Lord, they called him the Ashbringer. The reason being was that when he would wade into the massive throng of Scourge, he would cut a swathe of light, leaving only ashes in his wake.\n\nThis was the only mortal that true Scourge actually feared. Perhaps an impossibility but it was as close to inspired fear as one could come when facing Scourge.\n\nNow all of this went down around the time when the Order was dissolved and the Scarlet Crusade was born. The High Lord used to be a Lord amongst the Order of the Silver Hand. At this time, the lesser Mograine (present day Scarlet Commander) was only a teenager.\n\nThis story would not end on a happy note, sadly. In a particularly brutal day of battle, High Lord Mograine was overwhelmed in an ambush. Unprepared for the attack, he defended himself as best he could. Blinding flashes of light were all that could be seen of the melee. When it was over, all that remained were the ashes of the attackers and Mograine.\n\nThe wounds he suffered that day would prove to be the end of him. Slowly he felt himself turning. The lesser Mograine stood by his father's side until the bitter end, when the High Lord asked his son to take his blade (Ashbringer) and run him through. The lesser Mograine had seen this happen to others and knew what would become of his father. Reluctantly, with tears streaming down his face, he drove the Ashbringer into his father's decaying heart, killing him instantly.\n\nFrom that day forth, the Scarlet Commander made the extermination of the Scourge his life's goal - however - he would do it without the help of the Ashbringer.

Long story short, I've now fished in Thondroril River for a cumulative 5 hours at a constant skill of 437.  So far, no Ashbringer yet, or else I'd have links and pics, a fan club, many more Horde enemies, etc.  Hopefully I don't need some specific quest in my log for it to be possible to pop.  Re-reading the colorful story recently reminded me that the supposed slime that got Ashbringer stuck in it's body ran off and later attacked a caravan.  Well, that'd have to be at the bridge.  It's amazing how many times you can cross that bridge and not realize that wreckage is strewn all over the damn place in the water around it, and three caravan carts are sunk in the river near it, plus a catapult.  Needless to say, I've been fishing there now (maybe 3 out of the 5 hours).  Question still remains, where in the wreckage do you fish?  Does it matter?  Over Cart 1, Cart 3, Catapult?  Under the bridge?  In the floating debris by the shore, or the debris stuck behind the waterfall going down to the lake?  I've done a bit everywhere, but if it matters, you have to make a decision and stick with it since the chances are so slim.

Get your rep up with the shen'dralar (the Elves in DM West libarary) by bringing them books (Codex of Defense, Arcanist Cookbook, probably the librams as well) because you can spawn them and just hand em to the person. Once you get exhalted with them, see what happens when you talk to the prince, and if nothing then, spawn and kill nefarian, get his head and bring it to the prince. Either that, or spawn\/find Nefarian's Journal (if it exists) and try giving it to the prince.\n\nEdited, Fri Feb  3 16:14:03 2006","date":"2006-02-03T22:10:34-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Deadraiser","importedSubject":"hmmm k."},{"commentv2":1,"number":173,"id":3045513,"nreplies":3,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"i dont get it.

A theory was put forth stating a few rather wonky reasons why it would be there. Those reasons stated are extremely debatable, as well as a bit far-fetched. Albiet, none of us have a firm argument to where the Ashbringer can be found, or how; but the Naxxramas theory seems a bit out there. There are no ties involving stratholme and the Ashbringer, in fact there is nothing stating that the Ashbringer ever went anywhere NEAR stratholme. I believe we're putting a little to much hope behind the Naxxramas theory, while semi-substantial in some instances, such as the general connection of the Ashbringer and the Undead (Ashbringer goes *SMIGHT* -- Undead dies. Get the idea?). We cannot tell what the motivations are of the characters in Blizzard's realm, so we can certainly not assume that Kel'Thuzad said, \"Ooh! Shiney!\" and swooped down, grabbed the Ashbringer and made off with it. Neither can we tell what Nat Pagle might have done with it. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble, but we have to consider these things before we jump on the Naxxramas bandwagon.

(the glowing red sword at the bottom of the scar is the sword, not ashbringer, just one of the swords.)\nPossibly Ashbringer was TOO strong to even do that. Maybe its power made it \"self-destruct\" when they tried to destroy it by whatever means, and maybe it's in shards.\nThat would be a good explanation why so many things are connected to it. Hard to believe that you just get the whole sword from someone.\nNat Pagle might have fished up a shard...the DM prince might hold a shard...Nefarion might hold a shard...it's extremely possible.\nI'm sure you need the starter quest to be able to get the shards though, if my theory is correct.\nSo that is the question. Where do you get the starter quest? Thunderfury's starts in Silithus near air\/rock elementals, Sulfuras' \"starts\" from a drop off of Ragnaros, a fire elemental. I'd guess that Ashbringer's starts from either a drop off of a related NPC, something is fished up that Nat Pagle can tell you more about (the blurry note?), or someone around EPL\/WPL...maybe even the Scarlet Highlord himself, or Timolain maybe, if you catch my idea.\nGet to work on finding the starter quest, all you Ashbringer lovers! :)","date":"2006-01-26T00:13:36-06:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"HuntressItami","importedSubject":"Ashbringer Theory"},{"commentv2":1,"number":526,"id":3045881,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Can anybody provide me with a little history about Timolain?\nHow he came to be in the Scarlet Crusade...why he worked for the Scourge...how he died...where he died...etc.\n\nEdited, Fri Jan 27 13:32:36 2006","date":"2006-01-27T20:30:59-06:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"HuntressItami","importedSubject":"Timolain"},{"commentv2":1,"number":527,"id":3045882,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"anyone whos wondering about ashbringer...\n\n\nDOES NOT DROP OFF NEFARIAN.

I guess I must just be forgetting that so many WoW players are 14 year old know-it-all retards.\n\nThis is a PALADIN weapon. Not a warrior weapon, and not a shaman weapon, especially considering shamans can't use swords. Here is why this is a Paladin weapon.\n\nLet's look at the Ashbringer's damage. What the picture says is exactly what it does. 201-247 physical damage and 30-50 holy damage per every hit. Now paladins happen to have an ability called Judgement of the Crusader, which increases the holy damage taken by their target by upto 140 (Rank 6, level 52). That means that suddenly this weapon does not add 30-50 holy damage, but 31-190 holy damage per hit. Paladins also have abilities such as Sanctity Aura, which increases the holy damage dealt by 10%. That means we now do 34-199 holy damage per hit.\n\nThat is why this is a Paladin weapon more than anyone. Warriors can use their strikes to add damage, Paladins can use their seals to add damage, they will both do good damage with this. But Paladins are the only ones who can actually do additional damage AND increase the base stats of this weapon with their abilities. NOT warriors.

If you can equip a weapon and it works better than what you have, it is a good weapon for you no matter what your class.  At best, we can aspire to getting a particular weapon because it is useful.  Blizzard has a simple way of identifying class-specific items:  it says what class it is limited to right on the label.\n\nSaying that a particular item is only for a given class is like saying that pants are only for men and women should only be allowed to wear dresses.  That's idiotic since women can wear pants just fine and find them more useful in certain circumstances than a dress.  Its a tribute to women that they are flexible about clothes.\n\nSo ignore the class chauvenists--they want to manipulate things to their own advantage.  If a weapon is good for you, you are entitled to aspire to getting it.  If this is the best sword you can use, it doesn't matter whether it has holy damage.

Then, you can trigger an event in the Scarlet Cathedral in Tirisfals Glade and grab a quest that leads to the formation of the Ashbringer, which will lead to Outland. Therefore, this weapon will not be attainable until the Burning Crusade is released.</div>

This is effect occurs on equip; you regain your hated status with the Scarlet Crusade and normal status with Argent Dawn when it is unequipped.<br /><br /><b>Unique Scripted Encounter</b><br />Entering the Scarlet Monastery Cathedral with Corrupted Ashbringer equipped triggers a scripted event (see below for synopsis).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5859</b></h3>Lore<br /><br /> * During an expedition in Blackrock Spire, Commander Mograine (later Highlord Mograine, not the one in SM) took a unique crystal from a dead orc lieutenant. The crystal was originally from Draenor and was a &quot;living embodiment of darkness.&quot; However, upon placing a spell upon it, it became its polar opposite-- a manifestation of pure light. The Order of the Silver Hand agreed to use the crystal to craft a weapon to be the bane of the Scourge: The Ashbringer. (This can be seen in the Burning Crusade in the Southshore inn in the Caverns of Time: &quot;Thrall's Escape&quot;).<br /><br /> * Ashbringer was crafted by Timolain, an Archmage of the Scarlet Crusade. However, Timolain was secretely a member of the Cult of Damned, and this eventually became known to the Crusade, and hence, Timolain was executed (this is somewhat speculative). Kel'Thuzad then resurrected him as a Lich like himself. However, he was again killed at the hands of the Crusade, leaving only his phylactery behind (a phylactery allows a lich to regenerate himself over time if it is not destroyed). A large vile slime consumed the phylactery and took on some of Timolain's powers.<br /><br /> * Side Note: Timolain's Phylactery no longer drops from Large Vile Slimes as of patch 1.6. It may have originally been planned to be used in the Ashbringer questline, but when Naxxramus was in its inital planning stages Ashbringer may have been delayed as it would better coincide with Naxxramas content.<br /><br /> * The sword crafted by Timolain took on the name of its wielder, Scarlet Highlord Mograine, The Ashbringer. His title is derived from his uncanny ability to smite undead; Mograine could slay them so fast that they would vaporize, surrounding him in a cloud of ash.<br /><br /> * Highlord Mograine's son, Renault was a young member of the Scarlet Crusade. However, he secretly struck a bargain with Kel'Thuzad to eliminate his father. Presumably, in exchange Renault would take his father's place as commander of the Crusade.<br /><br /> * During the invasion of Stratholme, Mograine easily pummeled through waves of the Scourge. However, he did not receive reinforcements and was eventually overrun. Even after dropping his sword, the Scourge forces were not enough to kill him. Others in battle, presuming he was dead, sent Renault to retrieve his father's sword. Renault instead took up the sword and drove it through his weakened father. Such an evil act corrupted the Ashbringer. Renault left the sword and reported to his comrades that it had been lost.<br /><br /> * Kel'Thuzad then resurrected Highlord Mograine as a death knight.<br /><br /> * Renault's betrayal was witnessed only by Inquisitor Fairbanks, Mograine's advisor, who was trapped under a pile of corpses. A few days later, Fairbanks escaped Stratholme and returned to the Scarlet Monastery, recounting Mograine's cold-blooded murder to any who would listen.<br /><br /> * Renault had already assumed the position of Scarlet Commander at this time, and dismissed Fairbanks accusations. Fairbanks was taken into a secret room (where we find him in SM Cathedral) and murdered. Those members of the Crusade that heard and believed Fairbanks' story left the Monastery and formed the Argent Dawn.<br /><br /> * Renault is the current &quot;Scarlet Commander&quot; you face in SM Cathedral. Fairbanks was replaced by High Inquisitor Whitemane. Fairbanks was probably infected with undeath while in Stratholme, which is why you face him as an undead in SM Cathedral.<br /><br /> * During the scripted event (see above), Highlord Mograine's ghost appears in full dreadnaught. He confronts his son, kills him, and removes Fairbanks' undeath. Highlord Mograine despawns, and Fairbanks tells you the story of Ashbringer (which you have just read).<br /><br /> * Fairbanks goes on to tell you that the Corrupted Ashbringer cannot be purified-- the corruption is too deeply ingrained. However, Highlord Mograine's other, more pure son can craft a new Ashbringer. He resides in Outland.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5859</b></h3>Miscellaneous<br /><br /> * Ashbringer has been in the game files (and thus datamined) since release. It's been a popular &quot;carrot-on-a-stick&quot; that Blizzard has held in front of player's noses. Despite this, Blizzard remained silent on whether it was actually obtainable, leading many players to think that it could be obtained via a secret quest line that no one had discovered yet.<br /><br /> * On February 24th, 2006, Eyonix stated on the official forums that &quot;It's true that currently Ashbringer is not in the game, although one day in the future it will be, but not until after there is an awesome legendary item for casters. ;)&quot; -- a now obvious reference to Atiesh.<br /><br /> *Considering that many NPC's allude to the existence of Ashbringer, it is probable that it was originally intended to be in the game much earlier. The development team most likely delayed it so Naxxramas could be used to flesh out it's background story, and give casters a legendary item first.<br /><br /> * Ashbringer is mentioned by several NPCs and items:<br /> -Shendralar Zealots in Dire Maul will tell you that Prince Thortheldrin will reveal the location of the Ashbringer if you defeat Nefarion. However, even once Blackwing Lair was released, the Prince's lips remained sealed. This was probably part of the original questline involving Timolain's Phylactery.<br /> -Nat Pagles Guide to Extreme Anglin' describes the location of Ashbringer (flavor item)<br /> -Narain Soothfancy<br /> -Bardu Sharpeye<br /> -Caretaker Alen<br /> -Alexia Ironknife<br /><br /> * On the day that patch 1.11 went live, the official WoW China site had a picture of a paladin wielding Ashbringer (not corrupted). This image was removed shortly thereafter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>badget</b></h3>Ive heard that ashbringer can be fished up at north in the western plagued lands, Because: When archmage Timolain orriginally made the sword Ashbringer, he also made another gem/orb (the one that floats at the end of the sword). but when he was killed by the slimes, the gem was taken too and popped out of the slime, and down in a river (nat pagle also receives some information by fishing, becase some paper from a book also land in the water, and floated down the river and ended on his fish hook). Therefor the gem should be someplace at the end of the river(because it heavyer than paper)<br /><br />So make sure to fish alot up there. You may find the gem :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>36183</b></h3>Actually, it is real. <br /><br />This is the Ashbringer as it has been seen on GM's in the early (and I mean REALLY early) days of WoW. The days where the Arcanite Reaper was the best weapon ingame. <br /><br />Please keep in mind that at the last time this weapon was seen, TBC was hardly more than a rumor. The &quot;cleansed' version of Ashbringer has never been seen ingame ever since, so it is indeed most likely that the stats will have been upgraded.<br /><br />But that does not make this weapon fake.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shada</b></h3>It wouldn't be called &quot;Cleansed&quot; Ashbringer. It's just &quot;Ashbringer&quot;, once the corruption is removed. Therefore, take with a (large) pinch of salt.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>17619</b></h3>For cleansing the blade, you need to remake it.. Fairbanks said that the old was too corrupted, so we had to find his 2. son and make a new..<br /><br />The first was crafted from a evil crystal from a orc warlock, that came from Dreanor..<br />The only place I can think of is back in Illidans Black Temple.. Since he has taken use from corrupted fell orcs, I guess a VERY low droprate, maybe close to same droprate as Bindings or Eye of Sulf, just from some special mobs...<br /><br />When you got that tainted crystal from fel orcs that original came from Dreanor, just like the the one the first Ashbringer was made of, then it will start a quest..where you will have to gather a lot of mats.. Maybe some sort of Black Temple mats.. Very sure that a lot of Primal Nether.. and a big load of Holy things..<br /><br />The tainted crystal can maybe only be seen or taken from those who have the sword..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7675</b></h3>If the origonal crystal was taken from an orc warlock, then it seems very likely that the origonal orc warlock, Gul'dan may be in posesion of another. After the quest in Shadowmoon valley he was seen riding off in the direction of the black temple. It seems likely that he will be one of the bosses you face inside the black temple, perhaps droping such an orb.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>50134</b></h3>The best candidate to cleanse or re-craft Ashbringer so far (according to WoW wiki) is <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/?npc=21465">David Wayne</a>.<br /><br />He's a weapon smith, he talks about being part of &quot;something larger&quot; and looks remarkably like Commander Mograine.<br /><br />Can't wait to see this questline and this lore played out to completion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well, i am at least glad the guy admitted it was from an emulated server. However, the stats are uneringly similar for this type of weapon to sulfuras, as pointed out before. also, like windfury and sulfuras, it does seem to have a unique model of sorts, so it is possible the server it was made on pulled it up from patch 1.6 on the test server, or from deep within the centre game itself.<br /><br />the only things that worry me are that i have heard nothing on us or eu forums, and how can nefarion drop a SC weapon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>im pretty shure this item is FISHED UP from somewhere... item refrences in the game say that you can fish it up but its probable like a .0001 drop rate :P <br />and look at that worrior, he does not have uber gear, jsut a normal warrior ghetup... was fished, maybe in theramore where nat pagle stands, maybe not maybe in tyr's hand? maybe not... nothing says where to fish up just it is fished<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jul 11 17:09:28 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>THey GUy that is ranting about this being a Paliden only Weapon and not Warrior let me Set you Strait on some obvious game issues..<br /><br />ONE the + 30-50 Holy Damage.... THIS DOES NOT ADD TO YOUR SPELLS. Hell Dwarven Hand Cannon (epic gun) adds +3-7 Fire Damage so in your rationale that must be a mage gun right? <br /><br />TWO, this is a QUEST related drop... The quest starts after beating the final boss of BWL then talking to an elf in Dire MAul... SO if this was gonna drop it wouldnt be much of A disputed issue.<br /><br />Three, WHile Palidens could make use of this Warriors could as well.. Remember Warriors dont always use sword and Shield.<br /><br />Do not let your greed shadow your judgement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would realy love if ppl stop claming that this weapon is only a Spicale weapon for that &quot;Class&quot;. couse as far as i know i dont se any where it say's Warrior or Paladin or hunter or sharman weapon only. and Paladin can also do dps even if you say that suxy paladin's cant do dps, that's not true couse as far i know paladin can do the same dps as a warrior there dont use any styles + paladins also got SoC = Seal of Command that is a style there have the same attack thing as Normaly style that warrior do and som times when it procc work i can even do more damage then warrior style.<br /><br />but as i said i would realy love ppl be so selvfish and keep claiming that this weapon is only baciced on 1 class.<br /><br />and i think this weapon could be used for any of those class there can use 2h. <br /><br />and i dont mind ppl stop whining in here couse i think lot of ppl wouldn't mind hear how to get this weapon, so i think it could be nice if we only use this to informations. and go to Thottbot.com and if you would like to whine about that this is only a spicale class weapon!.<br /><br />and i think i speak for alot of ppl when i say that it is annoying when ppl keep post those lame things, so pls stop it. and if you see a dude whet this weapon or anyother weapon that you would like to be your selfs then congrationliseon them instedt and ask them how to get it.<br /><br />and btw plz if any 1 got any informations about this weapon i would realy like you to poste it hear. so we can all be happy whet this weapon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Itami has a good theory, BUT theres a piece of information that she (he? w/e) has wrong.<br /><br /> Ashbringer is what the Scarlet High Lord Mograine used to be called. Yes, the father of the Scarlet Commander Mograine.<br /><br />Technically, his sword was known as the Ashbringer but when people referred to the High Lord, they called him the Ashbringer. The reason being was that when he would wade into the massive throng of Scourge, he would cut a swathe of light, leaving only ashes in his wake.<br /><br />This was the only mortal that true Scourge actually feared. Perhaps an impossibility but it was as close to inspired fear as one could come when facing Scourge.<br /><br />Now all of this went down around the time when the Order was dissolved and the Scarlet Crusade was born. The High Lord used to be a Lord amongst the Order of the Silver Hand. At this time, the lesser Mograine (present day Scarlet Commander) was only a teenager.<br /><br />This story would not end on a happy note, sadly. In a particularly brutal day of battle, High Lord Mograine was overwhelmed in an ambush. Unprepared for the attack, he defended himself as best he could. Blinding flashes of light were all that could be seen of the melee. When it was over, all that remained were the ashes of the attackers and Mograine.<br /><br />The wounds he suffered that day would prove to be the end of him. Slowly he felt himself turning. The lesser Mograine stood by his father's side until the bitter end, when the High Lord asked his son to take his blade (Ashbringer) and run him through. The lesser Mograine had seen this happen to others and knew what would become of his father. Reluctantly, with tears streaming down his face, he drove the Ashbringer into his father's decaying heart, killing him instantly.<br /><br />From that day forth, the Scarlet Commander made the extermination of the Scourge his life's goal - however - he would do it without the help of the Ashbringer. He swore to never hold that blade again... not after what he had done.<br /><br />Mograine was the last to hold the blade. It is now gone, no trace of it anywhere...<br /><br />All this information is in game. You just have to find it :)</div>

This is on a private emulated server with a paladin holding it and have been in no way photoshopped or changed:<br /><br /><a href="http://photobucket.com/albums/v238/jks23/Misc/World%20Of%20Warcraft/Ashbringer/" rel="nofollow">http://photobucket.com/albums/v238/jks23/Misc/World%20Of%20Warcraft/Ashbringer/</a><br /><br />Also if you have WoW Model Viewer take a look in there and you can see the weapon does in fact exist in your .mpq file, thank you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well - I talked to a Gm' about this.<br />He is ofc not allowed to say anything about this.<br />But i got out of him that Ashbringer will come with the next patch or the one after that, when they open some new instance.<br />This will ofc be like Sulfuras/Thunderfury , very hard to optain,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, about 4months back I quit WoW, thinking that I would have a new social life and playing ragnarok wouldnt get me addicted: WRONG! A friend of mine showed me private servers so I decided to find out how to make one and yea... Now I know all about private servers and to tell you: Ashbringer is real though <a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v238/jks23/Misc/World%20Of%20Warcraft/Ashbringer/?action=view&amp;current=ashbringer.jpg" rel="nofollow"></a><br />That pic is from private server, How can I tell? Look at his chat, there is a GM command that you push like .add and some number from the items list and it spawns in your bag. Go look at the pic, also he is in Hyjal, an unreleased area, though you can get there if you have custom portals/ gm .go command soo yea.. stop argueing because this is the truth if you want a screen from my private server hit me on xfire: seedness ill send you all the screens you want. THANK YOU AND NOW YOU CAN STFU!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, i've been thinking about this weapon, and i may be on to something here...now, we know it's NOT a GM weapon, they use other ones and this isn't comparabel to GM status weapons. <br />---&gt; It IS obtainable<br /><br />We know that it will be coming from some Quest or another as if it was a drop, it would have dropped already. And coming from a Quest noone has ever gotten so far<br />---&gt; It comes from a reputation-requiring Quest<br /><br />and we also know that the Shen'dralar in Diremaul know something or other about it and that thy &quot;change their rewards for turning in books after a while&quot; (say some of the Lorekeepers)<br />---&gt; Shen'dralar might have something to do with it<br /><br />Oh, and you can get Reputation for the Sehn'dralar ... doesn't that seem odd?<br />---&gt; Shen'dralar give rep and will obviously at somepoint give some kind of reward<br /><br />So i come to the conclusion that, if you turn in enough books to get friendly/honored/respectful/exalted (who knows what the reputation requirments are...) with them you will be able to get a Quest/hint from some dude there... and i'll bet that the Quest will be long, and the Elf in that demon valley in south Winterspring will have something to do with it...<br /><br />Just my thinking...so go ahead and try to get Reputation with the Shen'dralar if you really want to get this damned sword ^^ and of course if you believe in my theory...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this isnt ONLY a paladin wep<br /><br />but it is indeed a paladin weapon<br /><br />in the sense our skills against people are HOLY<br /><br />our judgements...holy...our hammers....holy...and our undead skills yet again holy<br /><br />a warrior can use this for dps.....holy useless<br /><br />a hunter can for being a %^&amp;*....holy useless<br /><br />Why Paladins get best gear:<br /><br />go to <a href="https://www.worldofwarcraft.com" rel="nofollow">www.worldofwarcraft.com</a> and look at the paladin page<br /><br />we are the KNIGHTS IN SHINING FREAKIN ARMOR<br /><br />our job is SHOWBOATING<br /><br />this weapon is a PALADIN WEAPON<br /><br />damn n00bs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Definitely also a warrior item. Warriors shouldn't get an equal right to this weapon as Paladins, but most likely will, because everyone hates Paladins.<br /><br />Anyways... This is awesome because it's basically like having &quot;Seal of Righteousness&quot; active 24/7. Meaning, we can activate both Seal of Righteousness and Seal of Command.<br /><br />Sanctity Aura - 10% Holy Damage Increase<br />Improved Judgement of the Crusader (JotC) - +161 Holy Damage (Up to)<br />Vengeance - 15% to Physical + Holy Damage (When we crit)<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />30-50 Holy Damage<br /><br />Let's say it takes 33% damage bonus from the JotC. Which would increase it to 40-67 holy damage a hit. Sanctity aura makes it 44-74 holy damage a hit. Vengeance proc (Taken from base + JotC) gives a total of 50-84 holy damage a hit. Not bad... given this is a 3.00 attack speed weapon.<br /><br />Let's say it takes 66% damage bonus from the JotC. We are looking at 50-84 damage a hit. Sanctity makes it 55-92 damage a hit. And vengeance would give a total of 63-104 damage a hit.<br /><br />100% damage bonus is not likely, but you can do the math yourself if you're really interested.</div>

He's part of the AQ quest lines, nothing yet on whether or not he can expunge anything about the ashbringer. No one who's been searching for ashbringer has defeated nefarian and talked to the prince. My guess is that it might be handy to have Nefarians head with you when you go to talk to the prince though... Also, it may require you to up your rep with the Shen'Dralar before he tells you anything either..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i agree with deadraiser someone try to get it by killing nefarian and talking to prince of DM so if it works tell us so we dont have to keep this *!@#ing debate on how to get this people just want to knowhow to get it and to whoever said something about getting it with fishishing there no way in hell</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The tale Deadraiser spun was very captivating, and so I went and got all that fishing skill and crap I'd need. Long story short, I've now fished in Thondroril River for a cumulative 5 hours at a constant skill of 437. So far, no Ashbringer yet, or else I'd have links and pics, a fan club, many more Horde enemies, etc. Hopefully I don't need some specific quest in my log for it to be possible to pop. Re-reading the colorful story recently reminded me that the supposed slime that got Ashbringer stuck in it's body ran off and later attacked a caravan. Well, that'd have to be at the bridge. It's amazing how many times you can cross that bridge and not realize that wreckage is strewn all over the damn place in the water around it, and three caravan carts are sunk in the river near it, plus a catapult. Needless to say, I've been fishing there now (maybe 3 out of the 5 hours). Question still remains, where in the wreckage do you fish? Does it matter? Over Cart 1, Cart 3, Catapult? Under the bridge? In the floating debris by the shore, or the debris stuck behind the waterfall going down to the lake? I've done a bit everywhere, but if it matters, you have to make a decision and stick with it since the chances are so slim. Any advice, ideas?<br /><br />Marg</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hi!<br /><br />This is not confirmed, but an ingame friend told me his chinese friend said that(I know that sounds very strange already ;)): You need all the Nat Pagle gear and to fish in EPL(he did not specify where, gonna have him ask again), and that after a ^&amp;*!load of hours he found a book of some sort.. That book gave a 20sec fishing-buff that was used to fish in a certain spot, according to the chinese dude there is a ashbringer on their server. Gonna try and get some more out of it.<br /><br />Nothing new to the puzzle as for now I guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>in my last post i suggested there may be some useful information in a certain book. I was able to find the book and read it but saw no relation to Ashbringer. The book simply tells the story of the creation of the Scourge...which is somewhat relevant to Ashbringer but not directly in any case.<br /><br />If you want to read the book yourself heres a link <a href="http://legerion.com/bookswow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://legerion.com/bookswow.htm</a> look at the bottom left for the book. Its a good read if you want some backround on the new part of stratholme but if it related to Ashbringer has yet to be seen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Also, its been posted a billion times by people who neglect to scroll down (Yeah, I'm looking at you. Bastard.) there's a bit of text from the book &quot;Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin'&quot; that caught my eye the 50 billionth time someone posted it. We might be interpretting it the wrong way. It states &quot;the blade of the Scarlet Highlord, Ashbringer.&quot; Ashbringer could have stood for the nickname of the Scarlet Highlord, or the name of the blade. If we were to follow the explanation provided stating that Scarlet Commander Mograine's father was a Knight of the Silver Hand as well as one of the first Scarlet Highlords. Then it would validate that explanation, on account of Mograine's fathers nickname was Ashbringer, and I would bet they called his blade by the same name, which makes the wording of that page alltogether more complicated than previously thought. Mull this over people..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What is it with warriors and two handers all of a sudden? Dual wielding is by far the way to go for pvp or pve. Just combine bloodthirst and flurry and youre a dps madman, gaining health back super quick, and generating rage like no tomorrow. Two handers should almost always go to a hunter or pally first. In the case of this wep, a pally, cuz combine judgement of crusader with the holy proc plus seal of command and you obviously have the best pally 2h in the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been looking into this for awhile now aswell. Ive gone over to DM and spoken to all the shendrelar npcs. Over there I received two varying messages of the Prince and his knowledge of it but offered no other info. I doubt the sword is linked historically in game to Nefarian in anyway. Seeing as how the Prince is the one who read through Nat Paggles book millions of times, Hence the thoroughly read version you can find.<br />My next stop was to Caretaker Allen at Light's Hope in EPL, where he says he has no knowledge of the Ashbringer if you wait around him long enough. I dont know of any more NPC's who give even the name of the Ashbringer in text but I believe that it is findable in EPL within one of the fishable regions if it is fishable... It could be in Northdale where Taelan Fordring threw down his sigil,(And also his sword?) It could be in Stratholme which would be an obvious spot or Thondoril where the elder Fordring is. Ive heard AV as a possible location, but see no link between them. It would be nice to see more speculation on where this could drop rather the debate over who should use this sword.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dont think this weapon is in game yet I still believe its only in Testing right now but I would like to know where to get this. Everyone says you kill Lord Nefarian for it some say you can fish it. If you can fish this I would say out side of Stratholme cuz this is &quot;Blade of the Scarlet High Lord&quot; and If I recall before Stratholme was taking over by Baron Rivendare. The Scarlet Crusaders or whatever you want to call them ran that place. <br /><br />I bet the High Lord was there and when the Undead attacked he was outside fighting and when he died his sword fell into the water and was lost forever. There could be other places too. We might just have to wait till next patch to look for more clues on where to either Fish for this or who to kill for it.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Aug 23 14:12:48 2005</div>

It does not amplify Holy spells.<br /><br />I repeat, it does not amplify Holy spells.<br /><br />Look at the Warblade of Caer Darrow. It has +Ice damage. It adds ice damage on each attack - it does not amplify Ice spells (and how could it? two-handed swords can't be used by mages!).<br /><br />Duh.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Here is something resonable to assume...<br /><br />The Ashbringer as its stand is no doubt the most powerful weapon in the DATABASE, maybe not in game but in the database. Perhaps in the distant future, Blizzard will make a patch (or more likely an expansion) that allows players to travel to the Northrend continent and raid Icecrown, and eventually battle the Lich King. Then perhaps this will be a weapon that at least one player in the group must have in order to battle him, after which it will vanish from inventory(much like the Andonisus in Strat, and the many other weapons use to battle Kael'Thas with). Therefore its possible that this is a future weapon to use in a future quest which has players fighting the Lich King himself(it would make sense as this weapon, as stated in Warcraft lore, was made in order to combat the undead Scourge).<br /><br />Just a thought.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've heard this sword can be fished up in the Lake at SM Strat. I've been trying for a week now, devoting about 3 hrs a night to it, but have come up empty handed. (300+120/300 skill fishing)<br /><br />Some have also mentioned Northdale as a possible location or Winterspring.<br /><br />I guess one could just quickly go beat Nefarian and talk to the Prince in DM and find out the &quot;exact&quot; whereabouts as to go but... That's a whole lotta' work! =P<br /><br />Also has anyone actually seen another player running around with this weapon in-game?</div>

And so that's where you'll find the Legendary Sword of the Scarlet Highlord, Ashbringer. <br /><br />Ain't it amazin' what you run into in an ordinary day of fishing' ?&quot; <br /><br />so i think this weapon have like a Fishing rate or what ever you will call this on 0.00000001% mayby or as i said the book there mighty give it.<br /><br />i have also tryed to send a Trinket to a GM and he told the same as the other's there have tryed to get som informations out of them. but he didnt say that i didn't exicste. he told me &quot;Unfortunately, we are unable to answer specific questions which are meant to be discovered by players while exploring the world of Warcraft. Perhaps you could try asking another player nearby for more information?&quot;<br /><br />so i just say that this is alittle informations that this do exciste but just not &quot;Discorvered&quot; yet as they told us to try =)<br /><br />well this is all the Informations i got hope this will help alittle.<br /><br />Bamse Shadowsong Eu !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon is from fishing aswell. or lets say the next page of the book comes from fishing witch is dose. you may need to fish for days/weeks but fish it in av m8s. <br />then when you get the other page you find out how to get the next one if your smart. and when you got all pages you might get a quest some sort of. maby you bind the last page to start quest. then you get orders of getting a boss killed and only the one with the quest getts the sword as drop. its not imposeble to get its FRIKING HARD WORK AND YOU NEED TO BE SMART AS.S btw it isnt paly wep. if it where it woulda been classes: paladin morrons! .. EDIT: it sayes its the last page and it ends with its amasing what you come over with a normal day of fishing. so the end is about the fishing. it might start with something all difrend but ill tell you this sword dose exist.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Oct 29 01:21:59 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To Margarice: I would think that logically the river would have carried the blade down stream, so fish near the small falls to the lake with scholo island. There are some floating crates and wreckage there. I never garanteed that fishing it up would be easy, nor a definitive way of getting it. (keep trying though, people have fished up some pretty nice blues and even a few purples with diligence...)<br /><br />To Xiader: While this helps establish the fact that it does indeed exist in game, I'd like you to try something for me Xaider. Get your rep up with the shen'dralar (the Elves in DM West libarary) by bringing them books (Codex of Defense, Arcanist Cookbook, probably the librams as well) because you can spawn them and just hand em to the person. Once you get exhalted with them, see what happens when you talk to the prince, and if nothing then, spawn and kill nefarian, get his head and bring it to the prince. Either that, or spawn/find Nefarian's Journal (if it exists) and try giving it to the prince.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Feb 3 16:14:03 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I hope they upgrade Ashbringer before they make it available!<br />Because the Dark Edge of Insanity is already better and i guess theres gonna be an epic quality 2h in naxxra better than DEoI aswell.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Maybe Ashbringer is real, maybe it isn't.<br />Anyway, the story is great, and if u researh the story and try to find clues in WoW, then u will 100 % have fun. <br />I am 1 of those who believe in Ashbringer. <br />And i don't care what people say. Its a great story and thats the most importen thing for me. <br />People said it would maybe come in patch: 1.11. But it doesn't. So maybe it is already in the game. The things i like about it, is the story and mysteri. Playing pve and pvp gets boring, wow gets boring, and then u need some new experianse, discorver something no1 ever did. <br /><br />Why Belive in God, when we all know he isn't real?<br />Cos we need something to belive in, to live the life or play the game...</div>

It has quite a good speed but this ain't a good feature for by example Warriors. It's fast I know, but hé you can't Heroic Strike crit someone for like 2300 with top damage 274 and maybe the extra Holy Damage adds something but it can't compete to Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros his top damage. In my opinion not as good as I expected.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon has existed for quite some time people....have you never done a legendary weapon search prior to Blizz even talking about an expansion? It has been in game for as long as i can remember, you have to have an insanely high fishing skill to get the nat pagle page to even start the quest line. The cleansed ashbringer that everyone is talking about is available in expansion from cleansing &quot;corrupted&quot; ashbringer and hence has better stats. The original ashbringer was one of the best weapons in it's time, but is now under par due to new raid releases. As for the pic of the tauren wielding the ash, that pic has been on here for like a year ? a year and a half? someone else that has actually done legendary searches in that time frame please confirm...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I believe it is the prince who has Ashbringer<br /><br />or at least the knowledge of its whereabouts...<br /><br />when you go into the libary in shen'dralar (DM) the NPCs there..if you talk to them.. will hint many times that the prince himself has a grea amount of knowledge concerning the blade. they also say that he likes hearing stories and he also says that. If you beat all the bosses in BWL you can then &quot;tell&quot; the prince your story and so the quest for ashbringer begins i think. but until a guild clears all of BWL i doubt they can even see a quest or other option when you chat to him.<br /><br />The answer to finding this sword is beating BWL and telling Prince Tortheldrin the story.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the highest rank from the scarlets is the grand crusader who we all know is balnazaar.<br /><br />who could be above balnazaar in WoW lore?<br /><br />since the dreadlords have abandoned the scourge, and now only obey the legion, it could be someone from the ranks of the legion. It cannot be someone from the scourge, coz thats controlled by the Lich King in northrend, and those 2 - legion+scourge have parted ways after archimonde was defeated...<br /><br />also the scarlet crusade is the enemy of the scourge. however remember that these humans are the remnants of the order of the silver hand, the fallen order of palladins, that came to its current state after arthas killed uther. then balnazzar took control of them via MC, and uses them to figh the scourge?<br /><br />under whos orders? to serve what interests?<br /><br />remember: kil'jaeden is still alive and is leading the legions operations as the remaining commanding officer(archimonde was the other, but hes dead - gg wisp explosion :D )<br /><br />this sword, will have definately something to do with the legion, i bet money on it... :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Oh! and yes, it has been implemented in the game (with the 1.9 patch). Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK in response to the person who said some1 made it drop In a private server....if that is true that person is a complete retard. He could have just made it drop off a lvl 1.&lt;&lt;---my disbelief that someone could be so stupid leads me to believe that no one on a private server tried that and it did actually drop off Nef although i also think if that happened the person who it dropped for would post liek crazy on all the forums...who knows. Now lets continue<br /><br /> Also HunterssItami wtf Thunderfury isnt crafted and as for Sulfras it is a combination of a crafted epic with a drop from Rag. Furthermore, not only do i disagree with your theory that Ashbringer is a quest reward, but it makes me sick to think that someone as increadably ignorant as yourself would be allowed to live. You obviously have no more knowledge of its location than anyone else...who are u to shoot down one of the leading theorys! I strongly suggest you dont make anymore posts because all you are doing is slowing down the progress of everyone who is serious about finding this. I'm not trying to start a fight i just dont want you to post anymore.<br /><br />Now back to the matter at hand...From what I can conclude so far I would bet all my gold it is fished randomly in the river dividing Wpl and Epl. The prince in DM lead was interesting but since no one has been succesful in getting information out of him i would assume it is merely to throw people off(yes blizz would do that...they dont love us). The next step would be to make a post here if u have fished that river with a skill of over 425 i would ask you list your exact skill how long u fished approximatly and anything else you may think would contribute. We have to stop being selfish and work together to get this thing. If you have fished that river plz RE this post...PLZ!<br /><br />I APPOLOGIZE FOR THE LENGTH OF THIS POST<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jan 25 18:40:57 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The reason duel wielding is better for pvp is that it owns melee classes which is the bulk of pvp, on my server at least. Try using a 2h against a any tank or duel wield warrior. Even better, see what happens when a rogue stun locks you, you can use heroic strike, but you'll never hit them cuz your wep is too slow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunter weapon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The reason this is a pally wep is because the holy damage on the sword stacks with judgement of crusader increasing holy effects by 70 or so. ALSO, when a pally has spell damage gear, that also stacks! Altogether, a ret pally with judgement of crusader + plus whatever seal he wants (command ftw :P). That 30-50 could turn into 200 or even 300 extra damage per hit. Combine that with seal of command, which is also affected by judge of crusader, and you're doing about double damage per hit! So even though, arms warrs get to roll on most 2h first, pallys should get do to the incredible spell damage they can make out of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Not debating the added dmg for the +holy dmg. Not debating if it's a hunter sword (if you think it is sorry for you). My one question to pallies is what about the speed issue? I have heard from numerous sources that the speed of a weapon is a huge deciding factor for what is good for a pally and what is awesome for a pally. Something to do about the SoC proc chances per minute versus the number of swings you get. End result is I was always told that the slower the weapon is the better. Assuming it has a high end point for dmg which this beast obviously does. Is this true or not? And if so wouldn't the speed on this weapon be more detremental to a pally than benefical?</div>

Then you save Thrall(Rend Blackhands brother) take him through the portal, then you go through the last portal and you complete the quest. This is only what ive heared on Websites and whatnot.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just so everyone understands. it is technically a real weapon. on a private server my friend owns/ hosts you can aquire this weapon by typing .add 13262. you can also spawn neferian by typing .addnpc 11583. I have spawnd neferian probably 9 million times and not ONCE has this blade dropped. This is not a mythical weapon if you have ever found nat pagels guide to extreme fishing in Av, you will notice that at the end it says &quot;and that is what you will find in a normal day of fishing&quot; or something like that. It is the Blade of the scarlet lord. IF you follow the story. The lord of the scarlet crusade was chased in to the river in between the the eastern and western plauglands in that river... there are many other things that i can acount to for this. But i am guessing that with a super high skill , more than 300, that you can aquire this weapon from fishing.. out of that river...<br /><br />and as for the twin blades of azeroth... it requires level 70. they are rasising the level cap to 70 as well as adding in &quot;hundreds of new weapons, quests, instances... blah blah blah&quot; it is a GM weapon as of now becasue they can do what ever they want. These are ALL real weapons. If i can spawn em by typing .add &lt;#&gt; then they are real... adn ive spawned everything from hogger to neferian and all weps from a farmers broom to the twin blades of azeroth...<br /><br />you can safely make the assumption that if there is an item on this website, that it is acquireable in the future, or even now... *dun dun dun*<br /><br />Edited, Thu Feb 2 22:04:50 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have one word for all of you: Naxxramas.<br /><br />Despite what many of you may think, the Ashbringer is NOT CURRENTLY INGAME. However, it does exist and will be implemented along with the next 40-man raid instance: The Necropolis Naxxramas, hovering above Stratholme. This will not come with 1.10 though.<br /><br />As with all legendaries, it will require raiding. To be able to aquire such a powerful weapon without lots of hard work and player coordination, no matter how clever and cryptic a manner, will not happen.<br /><br />And lore-wise, think about it. Wouldn't Kel'Thuzad, commander of the Scourge forces, want to aquire an artifact of such power, power that was once the bane of his forces? Lore wise it all fits into the 40-man mindset of raiding his unholy fortress and finding a way to grabhold of Ashbringer.<br /><br />Happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Please everyone, no need for hostility.<br /><br />But remember... it WILL come. Naxxramas. Patch 1.11.<br /><br />But remember where you heard it first.</div>

(I have a friend who's buddies with a GM)<br /><br />Get your fishing all the way up to 300.<br />Get a Big Iron Fishing Pole or the Arcanite Fishing Pole. (Arcanite Fishing Pole comes from fishing contest in STV)<br />get gloves enchanted with fishing enchant.<br />put +100 fishing lure on pole<br />go fish the river between EPL and WPL.<br /><br />why? here the deal.<br /><br />Apparently the Scarlet Lord who carried Ashbringer got jumped by a slime, which made off with his sword. It the went off and attacked a caravan, throwing it, and the caravan into the river. One should be able to fish it up if one were to fish the river enough.<br /><br />Nat Pagle also mentions catching the weapon in one of his books. (the one with the last page missing, and yes, you can find that last page)<br /><br />My friend gleaned a tantalizing nugget of info from his GM buddy, you have to have over 425 Fishing skill to ever stand a chance at fishing Ashbringer up. (thats why you need those enchants, fishing pole and lure...)<br /><br />Winning all of Nat Pagle's gear from the fishing contest also isn't a bad idea, in theory it might help better your chances at catching it...(what with nat pagle cathing it...your in the same gear he caught it with...*ding*)<br /><br />There, now all of you go and fish for your lives!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>&quot;locked up and hidden&quot;<br />Very very very very interesting.<br />And possibly one of the best I've heard on this forum.<br />All legendaries so far require killing major raid bosses (Garr, Baron, Windseeker, Ragnaros, etc.) and many mats (arcanite bars, elementium, etc.). Possibly, you have to forge some super key? And kill some huge raid boss that's guarding the &quot;safe&quot;?<br /><br />Edit: Also, yes Nat Pagle says &quot;and that's where you'll find the Ashbringer. aint it amazin what you find in a normal day of fishin?&quot; but that dosen't mean he *actually found the blade*. Maybe he found out how to get it. Maybe you can fish up the Highlord's/Scarlet Commander Mograine's journal, and that will say where it is?<br />I predict something along the lines of which reads &quot;The pages are blurred and illegible, except for the last one.&quot; - &quot;...and that's where I hid the Ashbringer.&quot; &gt;_&gt; lol<br /><br />Edited, Fri Feb 3 18:39:23 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>None of you can distinctly and utterly prove that the Ashbringer will be obtainable in Naxxramas. A theory was put forth stating a few rather wonky reasons why it would be there. Those reasons stated are extremely debatable, as well as a bit far-fetched. Albiet, none of us have a firm argument to where the Ashbringer can be found, or how; but the Naxxramas theory seems a bit out there. There are no ties involving stratholme and the Ashbringer, in fact there is nothing stating that the Ashbringer ever went anywhere NEAR stratholme. I believe we're putting a little to much hope behind the Naxxramas theory, while semi-substantial in some instances, such as the general connection of the Ashbringer and the Undead (Ashbringer goes *SMIGHT* -- Undead dies. Get the idea?). We cannot tell what the motivations are of the characters in Blizzard's realm, so we can certainly not assume that Kel'Thuzad said, &quot;Ooh! Shiney!&quot; and swooped down, grabbed the Ashbringer and made off with it. Neither can we tell what Nat Pagle might have done with it. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble, but we have to consider these things before we jump on the Naxxramas bandwagon. (Not that I'm saying its a bad one, its providing hope to the downtrodden adventurer in search of his destiny, via Ashbringer)<br /><br />Edited, Sat Feb 18 02:49:01 2006</div>

You gotta get the book from Av (random drop) then prolly spend a month or 2 going across every continent an instance in the world loooking for the remaining pages. Once you have them all you'll have to read the book (Nat Pagles Guide to Extreme anglin) then go where he got the sword fishing start fishing in the spot and if you have fishing at the highest possible skill (enchantes + lure included) youll have about a .00001 chance of cathing a baby fish that make the mother angry (not sure what fish it will be) if you kill it ashbringer will be waiting inside. Well thats my thoughts at least.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With this weapon at 3.00 speed it may be possible to get Perma-Vengance on a pally. It would require a 30% chance to crit..obviously it wouldnt be perfect since the chance to crit isn't 30 times over 100 swings, but 30% on each swing, but with full vengance, the damage would end up: 231-284 and 34-57 Holy damage. Add Judgement of the Crusader, and that would increase the holy damage even more. With full agi gear and +to crit items I may take work, but its possible to get +30% chance to crit, anyone who could get this weapon will have the resources to get up to 30% crit if they put enough thought into it. Mixing in Seal of Command, holy crap, the pally who wields this could do some serious damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well as someone stated after i posted..many people claim to have GM friends, hence my addition of take it for what its worth. I dont really care wheather or not you all believe me. I cannot offer any firm proof of my previos statement, but like i said its what my friend told me. He is a GM. Hes a RL friend ive known most of my life not some &quot;quasi cyber friend&quot;. He told me that it will result from a quest, most likely from Naxxramas. He tells me the quest is in the game, you just cant get it or any of the quest pieces yet(basically just a place holder asz of yet). Dont believe me if you want, whatever, I have posted nothing here that wasnt told to me as a good faith fact. I will concede the fact that a GM is only a GM in the end tho, and thus not entirely privy to all future implimentations. Sorry for the long post. Again take it for what its worth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So why are there like 5 or 6 npcs in the game currently talking about it with hints and stuff?<br />What's the connection to fishing? There has to be a connection to fishing because of what it says in Nat Pagle's book. If it's just another boss drop, that's not even available yet, what's up with all of the now-present clues? Maybe at one point (on a Euro server or something) there was a fishy way to get it, but then Blizz changed it? 1.11 will come out and Blizz'll be like, &quot;Aww, we was just playin' foo.&quot; Is that the idea?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i just wanted to say this sword does exist and is confirmed by many different ways. <br />1) It is in the model part of the main WOW mpq file.<br />2) GM's have had it before (Item creation is forbidden on main servers)<br />and 3) There are 2 files on server side. Items.plc and Items_PM.plc the PM stands for player made. the ashbringer is in the Items not the Itmes_PM. <br /><br />You can believe what u want but i am well on my way to getting this sword with my warrior i already have the bottle attained by fishing in the pond in EPL, as expressed in the WoW forum post above. <br /><br />All in all this sword is in the game. Have fun and happy trails :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok i will admit theres alot of theory and stuff around this.....for those of you who dont now, this sword is not in game YET,but it will come eventually,but a GM on the forums annouced that they will not release it till they make a legendary spell-caster wep.Its been in the model thing for a long time know and the only way to use it right now is going to a private server which is where some of those picks came from.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Apr 9 00:10:53 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I looked on a site, korean and on the loot table theres a 4 deathknight boss, similar to the one in BRD, and they have a chest that can drop corrupted ashbringer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am just guessing, but I'd say this is not the real Ashbringer. For two reasons.<br />1.) Corrupted Ashbringer is better than this right now.<br />2.) If this will be a level 70 weapon, why is there a level 60 mace, Might of Menethil, with way more damage? It's not even legendary.<br /><br /> Besides that, I heard a GM tell someone to get this sword - you will have to:<br />-Kill Nef<br />-Tell the prince in DM (who tells you where to go for it)<br />-Max out fishing (Rod, gloves, etc)<br />-Go to the Caverns of Time <br />-Go back before Nat fishes it up and get it<br />-Go back through the portal<br /><br /> I don't think this is right, since you have to &quot;cleanse&quot; the Corrupted Ashbringer, but for now - this is what Blizzard has given for hints. This will probably require long quest lines. If Ateish, Sulfuras, and Thunderfury take almost a year (depending on drops) I'd say this would be no easier.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes, this item does go in conjucntion with JoCr, because of the fact that it says &quot;holy&quot; damage and not &quot;arcane&quot;. Holy damage is only a paladin credited version of arcane damage.<br /><br />If it said +30-50 arcane damage then it would not work with JoCr.<br /><br />And for you hunters out there who want this, stay the hell away, my guild would never allow you to even think of rollin on any reagents for this. COMBAT HUNTERS SUCK.<br /><br />And warriors just stick to Sulfura, Hand of Ragnaros, its clearly better for MS because of speed.<br /><br />Oh, and btw, I dont believe this can be fished, thats just ignorant thinking, but I bet to get some of the reagents you have to fish something outa the strat lake.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Aug 28 14:03:53 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>first i also asked myself how can you get 440+ fishing? as far as i know you can get the 300 from skill + 100 form Aquadynamic Fish Attractor + 20 from the fishing pole (25 for horde) + 2 from the enchant so a max of 422 (427 for the horde).<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">You do fish this ultra uber sword, you really do. but you have to download a mod to get coords things working, kill nefarian and talk with prince to get the cords, fish in this spot for a while or just once to get it</div><br /><br />fish for a while or just once? i don't think it's &quot;that easy&quot;. if the prince just tells you where to fish and you only have to do this once or a few times there will be hundreds of ppl running around with this sword. i guess he will tell you where to fish but the drop rate will still be damn low.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A player on Zul'Jin got it a few days ago. Didn't have a chance to ask where or how and I also don't remember his name =/ Im sure if you searched the servers population you'd get some answers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You people do know that there is a faction nowadays that's called Shen'Dralar, right? I'd bet if you get a high enough reputation with them, let's say... revered and/or exhalted you'll be able to start some kind of a quest series (which will include some mad-ass boss killing of some sort, i'd reckon) kinda like the Hydraxian Waterlord-quests and the water you get to drowse the runes down in MC. <br /><br />Along those lines are my guesses as to where you might be able to get clues about Ashbringer. And since the Prince is really in to storytelling i'd believe the quests will be some major ones to satisfy his needs</div>

Whatever screenshots you see are of private servers and/or fake. Blizzard Reps have specifically said that until a &quot;Caster Legendary&quot; is in the game, Ashbringer is on a back-burner, and will not be dropped/forged/fished/stolen/granted to you by flying monkies/etc., in game. The ONLY way to wield it currently is through private servers, or through a model viewer.<br /><br />There are hints and clues in the game that will eventually lead to the real Ashbringer, which by the time it actually is released or in a &quot;getable&quot; format, it will most undoubtly be upgraded stat wise.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Mar 28 10:06:55 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It does not drop off of Nefarion.<br />It is not fished up randomly.<br />It is connected to many different things.<br />It is most likely a crafted weapon, like Sulfuras and Thunderfury. (no, those items do not say &quot;created by whoever&quot; on them, so Ashbringer most likely would not either.)<br />The Scarlet Crusade destroyed all weapons made for them by Timolain (he was under the service of the Scourge for a while when he made the blades) because the blades were made to take over the minds of the Scarlet Crusade. If you do the Battle of Darrowshire questline, you will see that one of the scars in EPL was created by a blade that they tried to destroy. (the glowing red sword at the bottom of the scar is the sword, not ashbringer, just one of the swords.)<br />Possibly Ashbringer was TOO strong to even do that. Maybe its power made it &quot;self-destruct&quot; when they tried to destroy it by whatever means, and maybe it's in shards.<br />That would be a good explanation why so many things are connected to it. Hard to believe that you just get the whole sword from someone.<br />Nat Pagle might have fished up a shard...the DM prince might hold a shard...Nefarion might hold a shard...it's extremely possible.<br />I'm sure you need the starter quest to be able to get the shards though, if my theory is correct.<br />So that is the question. Where do you get the starter quest? Thunderfury's starts in Silithus near air/rock elementals, Sulfuras' &quot;starts&quot; from a drop off of Ragnaros, a fire elemental. I'd guess that Ashbringer's starts from either a drop off of a related NPC, something is fished up that Nat Pagle can tell you more about (the blurry note?), or someone around EPL/WPL...maybe even the Scarlet Highlord himself, or Timolain maybe, if you catch my idea.<br />Get to work on finding the starter quest, all you Ashbringer lovers! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I cannot believe how ignorant some of the posts here are about who this weapon is best for. I guess I must just be forgetting that so many WoW players are 14 year old know-it-all retards.<br /><br />This is a PALADIN weapon. Not a warrior weapon, and not a shaman weapon, especially considering shamans can't use swords. Here is why this is a Paladin weapon.<br /><br />Let's look at the Ashbringer's damage. What the picture says is exactly what it does. 201-247 physical damage and 30-50 holy damage per every hit. Now paladins happen to have an ability called Judgement of the Crusader, which increases the holy damage taken by their target by upto 140 (Rank 6, level 52). That means that suddenly this weapon does not add 30-50 holy damage, but 31-190 holy damage per hit. Paladins also have abilities such as Sanctity Aura, which increases the holy damage dealt by 10%. That means we now do 34-199 holy damage per hit.<br /><br />That is why this is a Paladin weapon more than anyone. Warriors can use their strikes to add damage, Paladins can use their seals to add damage, they will both do good damage with this. But Paladins are the only ones who can actually do additional damage AND increase the base stats of this weapon with their abilities. NOT warriors. Get it?</div>

Warriors might want this, but it's not ideal for them because it's faster than they usually like (yes, I know; you'd all make an exception for this weapon :P).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Obviously, a pally could capitalize on this weapon better than other classes, but that doesn't mean that only pallys should have it. If you can equip a weapon and it works better than what you have, it is a good weapon for you no matter what your class. At best, we can aspire to getting a particular weapon because it is useful. Blizzard has a simple way of identifying class-specific items: it says what class it is limited to right on the label.<br /><br />Saying that a particular item is only for a given class is like saying that pants are only for men and women should only be allowed to wear dresses. That's idiotic since women can wear pants just fine and find them more useful in certain circumstances than a dress. Its a tribute to women that they are flexible about clothes.<br /><br />So ignore the class chauvenists--they want to manipulate things to their own advantage. If a weapon is good for you, you are entitled to aspire to getting it. If this is the best sword you can use, it doesn't matter whether it has holy damage. You are allowed to do holy damage, right? It may be a unique surprise attack on your enemies to be doing holy damage when they aren't prepared or expecting it, right?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hate to rain on your parade but... this is a warrior weapon.

It's true.<br /><br />Best weapon in game now: Corrupted Ashbringer. <a href="http://www.worldofraids.com/?page=viewitem&amp;idd=33" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofraids.com/?page=viewitem&amp;idd=33</a><br /><br />Second best : Might of Menethil. <a href="http://www.worldofraids.com/?page=viewitem&amp;idd=39" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofraids.com/?page=viewitem&amp;idd=39</a><br /><br />Third best: Ashbringer. If you need a link for this, go jump in front of a car.<br /><br />You might be a retard and say, hey! Why's ashbringer better than Menethil?<br />O hoe! well. +1% Chance to hit.<br />Steals 200 life average ona proc. Seriously, wtf? Stack that with crusader. Pwnage.<br /><br />( I'm basing this on PvP, which ones I'd choose. Menethil's would be better for a DPS/offtank in a raid, as, considering you'd have priests/druid's healing you... 200/400 wouldn't really do anything but confuse your healers. Plus, what kind of tank would even consider using a 2 hander? Lol, as if. <br />However, In PvP, that 200, or maybe 800 over time, could save anyone's life. )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>guys doent u think, that they will update stats..<br />for example im swordsmith and i have reseached on the items, the &quot;tier3&quot; <br />of lionheart sword has 123 dps... i think ashbringer will outmax that.. they just need to update the stats... or else there wont be any idea to get a legendary sword throw alot of quest, when u can get another sword just for blacksmithing with much more dps...<br /><br />thats just my thought</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have no idea why anyone would ever spec entierly into retri.. all you need is 11 points in it to get Seal of Command<br /><br />And yes I am pretty sure its safe to say this is a paladin sword. Although any tool that can use 2H swords would want it for the &quot;cool factor&quot;<br /><br />And holy damage is an entirely different school of magic and it *shouldnt* be able to be resisted....<br /><br />I was also thinking this is the sword the book speaks of &quot;Amazing what you can find in a day of fishing..&quot; or whatever, the fishing thingy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>And oh for those who says &quot;WTF does nefarian has to do with this?&quot;, well here's your answer: prince wants a real hard story , that is hardcore to make, you will get a Quest after you killed nefarian to talk to the prince, &quot;somehow&quot;, so. its like he wants to hear you kill ragnaros on 5 minutes from MC start, just make this and get that sword. it has absolutly nothing in history to do with BWL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You prob have to Kill Nefarion, loot a item that starts a quest (and watch it is 1 per kill) to talk to the prince in DM, then starts a big quest part of which is fishing out the remains of the Ashbringer from somewhere, most likley requiring 455 Fishing skill...<br /><br />I highly doubt Blizz would make this just &quot;fishable&quot; even if you have every rare fishing item :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There is a lot of wierd (maby true) opinions about how to get this truly awsome sword, but there can only be one, its a bit wierd that it has to be fished from Alterac Valley though, becouse it kinda has no connection to scarlet high lord, and the thing about the GM talking, is probably a load of BS (no offence) becouse the GM's arent alowed, at all, to talk about ingame stuff.<br />But the model is in there ppl, and the stats are on allakhazam, so its in there or not in there YET, GO GET IT BOYS!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Apparently upon receiving the corrupted ashbringer you take it to the scarlet monastery cath and there is an event that leads you to speak with grand crusader mograine(not the one you fight in cath on an SM run but rather his father he betrayed who wielded ashbringer) and then you talk to fairbanks with mograine (skeleton in the back room who was Mograine's #1 advisor)and fairbanks becomes human again and tells you that mograine has another righteous holy son who could craft ashbringer, but you must travel to outland...so we have some more waiting to get what blizzard has been hinting at for so long :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How to obtain this Blade, By StormTempest<br /><br />Step 1. Do Naxxaramus and get Corrupted Ashbringer<br />Step 2. Go to SM Cath and walk around/talk etc. talk to undead boss dude (hidden boss)<br />Step 3. Wait until hell freezes over and buy the Expansion...<br />Step 4. Talk to the ORIGINAL Mograine's other son and he will reforge the blade to you...therefore it won't talk to you or be corrupted...<br />Step 5. Enjoy your new legendary hella strong holy blade and be happy it no longer talks to you ^_^<br /><br />The Original Mograine is the first wielder of the this blade the Mograine boss in SM Cath is his son the other is somewhere in outland.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Recognize! The Corrupted Ashbringer cannot be, cleansed to be Ashbringer it is stated in game. The quest for Ashbringer WILL be long. Really long and you wil have to run multiple obsticales in multiple instances. Similar to the BE Polearm quest but on larger scale. Anyone ever talk to Prince in DM? He will have something to do w/ quest. My guess w/ the introduction of heroic dungeons is you will have to kill Nef in BWL on Heroic to get it. May even have a time limit. It will include Gathering materials, etc etc. Since Corrupted is Epic 90 dps my guess is the legendary will top I repeat WILL TOP, the Mooncleavers and Lionheart Blades. YOU WILL Need a flying mount as you will need to find the lesser morgraine in outland and I bet he's on some floating island. The Ashbringer is gonna be IT, the Legendary of Legendarys for those who can wield it. Blizzard may eventually include a hunter legendary as well. Windseeker doesnt count. LOL! One thing is for sure it wil be very exciting to see the dps and stats of The Ashbringer, current stats are invalid....trust me.</div>

HOWEVER, this is a fun way to prank some of your more gullible friends by linking the ashbringer and shift right clicking the link to show your character with the item. All you gotta do then is screenshot it, crop the image, and share it with your guild mate's discord and see who will fall for it &gt;:)</div>
