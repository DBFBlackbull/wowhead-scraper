<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3>Strat scarlet run is a nice way to get fast money. Yep you usually get 3-5 orbs each run. So everyone in your party will get 1 orb to sell. On most servers they sell for around 40~60g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8004</b></h3>yup, farming live strat is what a lot of people do for good money. getting these just to sell them, or to sell crusader enchant is a good idea.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did nearly 10 Strat runs for the epic robe, and saw that pattern 2 times. (First time I rolled 2... and I lost. Second time I got it) But I couldn't get any of that orb, even 3 times out of 10 there wasn't any orb dropped.<br />But I'm happy I got the pattern:Truefaith Vestment. <br /><b>Drop rate is definitely on your luck~!</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got two of them to drop last night running Stratholme with my guildmates (didn't win the roll for either of them).&nbsp; On Shadow Council right now, these babies are selling for 100+ G a pop!&nbsp; I want two for a Crusader enchant, so you'd better believe I'll be joining a lot of Strat raids..!</div>

Probably bad droprates as usual, but they where going pretty cheap. I've seen worse, starting price at 100G.<br /><br />My enchanter also enchants for free as long as they have the reagents (or most of them) But they always come back screaming after checking AH :))<br /><br />Some say: &quot;<i>Go get the reagents yourself</i>&quot; Yeah true, I do.. But sometimes it makes me mad... Like when you're in a 'team'.. One gets it because he says he needs it for blacksmithing or enchanting whatever, later on when you check AH you'll see that <b>HE</b> put it in there. Needed for blacksmithing my azsssssshara.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What I'm wondering is, why the hell are these selling for so freakin' much on the AH? It's common that 3-4 drop PER run on Scarlet side.<br />The going price is on average 75g on my server (Gorefiend) which is more than a nexus crystal.<br />Let me remind you: you have to disenchant a freakin' epic to get a nexus crystal.<br /><br />Tell me why disenchanting epic items goes for the same price as a common drop in Scarlet Stratholme?<br />(Not to mention that it's 10x easier to get a Righteous Orb over an epic item)<br /><br />Just doesn't make sense...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>they sell because they are used in popular enchants such as 55+ healing, and some people really are too lazy and will pay the price demanded for these rather than PuG a strat run to get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The price of Righteous Orbs shot up due to the lack of people running stratholme.&nbsp; Now that some time has passed the price has started to work it's way down.<br /><br /><u><b>Laughing Skull:</b></u><br /><br />Pre-TBC - 40g / Righteous Orb<br /><br />TBC - 60-80g / Righteous Orb<br /><br />Several months after - 40-50g / Righteous Orb</div>
