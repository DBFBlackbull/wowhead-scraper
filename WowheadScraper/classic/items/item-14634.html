<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ormriss</b></h3>This is a limited supply vendor item. To get it, you must buy it from Bro'kin, a goblin vendor on the northwest wall of the Ruins of Alterac. Many elite ogres are in the ruins, so be prepared for a fight if you under level 50. Around level 50, the ogres are grey and you can walk past them without fighting.<br /><br />This vendor is often camped and the recipe is on an 80-90 minute respawn, so if you really want this recipe, either be ready to wait a while or log your character out at the vendor.<br /><br />This recipe often goes for 5-10g on my server, so it's worth the wait to pick it up for a measly 25s. Frost Oil is needed for several recipes, but is more importantly used in a quest available to both factions in the Badlands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9452</b></h3>He is located at the coordinates: 38,38<br /><br />This is located by going into the Ruins of Alterac (Level 38+ Elite Ogres) and going toward the right of the large castle which is located at the end of the path that leads into the ruins.<br /><br />If you look at your large world map, there is an image of a tower where he is located (looks like a rook piece from chess).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>43758</b></h3>All above info is correct. If you time it right you can get past most of the Ogres up to the ramp that leads to Bro'kin. If you have Ogres on your tail while running to Bro'kin just past him and go in to the hallway of the tower (rook piece). The Ogres are too big to fit so they will stop at the opening and not follow you. You can access Bro'kin inventory (through the wall) while sitting in the hallway close to him so you don't attract any attention from passing enemies (Horde/Alliance). Camped Bro'kin as a Lv 38 Mage for 35mins. Of course he was out of stock when I got there. &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He's on booty bay faction</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It seems that he has a few items that are &quot;limited supply&quot; that cycle through on a time-based manner.&nbsp; For example, when I first arrived, he had some Greater Healing Potion.&nbsp; After a while those disappeared, then were replaced by Mana Potions after a short time of no &quot;limited supply&quot; items available.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Once upon a time a female Ork alchemist went to see her friends in Orgrimmar.<br />A close friend asked her for a mysterious oil called Frostoil, he somehow needed for blacksmithing. Poor orkish girl had tot admit, she'd never ever heard of something like &quot;frostoil&quot;. Indeed she got curious. In a hurry she went to &quot;Thottbot&quot; searching for how tot get the damned recipe. (She felt terribly offended not know that one!) <br /><br />The more information made her more weird. She crossed Hillsbrad a thousand times I think, just to find that damned Goblin. After she returned without suceed she called her demon horse to ride to the Alterac Mountains.<br />And again: She couldn't find the Goblin.<br /><br />But how could she have known, this stupid Goblin is suddenly enjoying the presence of OGERS ? While a little diner-group of perhaps 8 Ogers (elite) was tracking her, she suddenly discovered a bridge to the upper stage of the castle wall. Affliction was high so she had to take this only way out. <br />BUT WHAT DID SHE SEE ? The Goblin!<br />She rescued herself just infront of his feet ... an died.<br /><br />She revitalized just in front of him and could FINALLY ask him for the recipe... But what? It was obviously sold out...<br />After some weird minutes of desperation and moaning she decided to log out for a while. After some hours she went in again... still infront of the goblins feet... AND she got her recipe :) <br /><br />And if she's still alive (but the ability of revitalizing makes it quite possible *grin*) she's still having fun with her new recipe :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He's a bugger to find.. seriously...<br /><br />Ruins of Alterac - 38.38<br /><br />He's up stairs @ the tower, one of those green goblin people</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was making the circuit around Alterac Mtns looking for ore to mine and I saw this little green head poking over the edge of the wall to the ruins. I went up to the base of the wall and saw a grayed-out merchant icon (the bag with the arrow) and his name. I thought, what the heck, went back to where the wall has breaches at the edges and ran in. Moved around the left side of the City Hall where you fight Muckrake to get the book for that Preserving Knowledge quest and hugged the mountain (didn't have to fight any ogres) until I got over to the section of wall when the goblin was. He had the Frost Oil recipe and two mana potions available so I bought them. I didn't realize he was the only one who sold this recipe. I checked the AH and the recipe (there were two) was going for for 5 gp and 8 gp (buyout). Nice return on my investment. I'll head back there next time I'm scouting for ore and see what else he has.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There is a spawn time on this recipe, Bro'kin might not have it when you are around, I believe the spawn is every 15 minutes. Once I confirm this I will edit this post.<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />It spawns every hour from last purchase, soo if he dont have it, it will respawn within a hour.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Jan 28 21:50:00 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Before the patch I could obtain one recipe every 30 minutes... I didn't check after 1.5.0 what the timer is, if it changed of course...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been sitting on this little guy now for 1 hr and 10 minutes. No recipe. Only one healing potion, and one mana potion. Maybe it is bugged or at least bugged on Icecrown server... =( I'm getting frustrated.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />Well, he spawned 2 recipes after 1 hr 47 mins of camping him... I literally sat on him the whole time. Maybe time was lengthened?<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jul 4 02:02:06 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These seem to be pretty expensive on AH.<br />It's worth finding the merchant to buy from..<br /><br />I eventually sold 1 for 11g after bit of a bidding war..<br />this is on the Greymane server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went to buy this pattern for an alt, and i saw a level 40 rogue afk'd by the vendor, I killed the rogue opened trade with the vendor and loe and behold I purchased the recipe. LOL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>EchseKuhTor</b></h3>is this recipe purchaseable at the moment? Also, can I buy it for an alchemy friend who doesnt have the time to camp the npc?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thready</b></h3>Sold by a goblin named Bro'kin in the Alterac Mountains, costed me 25 silver. He is standing on a wall, so you'll have to run up the ramp.<br /><br />Lots of level 35 to 40 elite ogres patrolling the area so be careful. I had to stealth through and do a death run at level 32.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AllisInWndrlnd</b></h3>Literally sitting on top of him for over 30 minutes... A handful of others stopped by, so it's possibly someone else grabbed the recipe. Noticed a mana potion he had in stock was gone when I checked him after being afk for 10 minutes, so maybe someone else got the recipe. Bought the 2 greater healing potions he had in stock, but that didn't seem to help. Currently there are no limited items in stock. Hopefully it doesn't take another hour to spawn, but I definitely can confirm this isn't on a 15 minute re-spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jerbearjerry2000</b></h3>Seems to me that he has several things that are limited quantities. I bought the Frost Oil recipe at 12:32 AM and at 12:42 he put up Mana Potion x2, then at 12:52 he put up Greater Healing Potion x2. Nothing else until 01:49 I got the Frost Oil recipe again. Nobody else approached Bro'kin while I was there. So about 1 hour and 7 minutes between recipes. At that point I waited another 15 minutes and nothing came available.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>streathh</b></h3>Recipe resupplied after 25mins for me (23min and some to be exact)</div>
