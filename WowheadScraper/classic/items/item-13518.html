<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My guess is that it would be more like the mage spell &quot;Ice Block&quot; than anything else... you're immune to all damage, it removes all negative buffs, it can't be dispelled, you can't move, but you don't grab any more or lose any of your aggro. Sure, it'll work for a main tank... if nobody does anything at all after you drink it. Best use is probably for a non-tank who over-aggro'd, so it gives the main tank time to pull it all back to them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Oh woops.. looks like I'm wrong. If you click where it says the Use effect up there, it brings you to a page where it lists the effects. The effects are 1. Stun 2. Immune Aura and 3. Sanctuary. Click on Sanctuary and it says what other skills have that effect, and they are Vanish and Divine Intervention. So basically its your own little DI without having to kill anyone... and it lasts longer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is it really that hard to just click on the effect?<br /><br /><b>Effect 1</b><br />Apply Aura: Stun<br /><b>Effect 2</b><br />Apply Aura: Immune School (All)<br /><b>Effect 3</b><br />Sanctuary<br /><br /><b>Spells that use Sanctuary:</b><br />Divine Intervention, Vanish<br /><br />This means that you lose aggro.<br /><br />The key difference is that DI has <i>Apply Aura: Mod Uninteractible</i> and this doesn't, so it sounds like the mobs can still reaggro you if you don't get far enough way when triggering it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of 1.6, the use of this flask does not have DI effects, as using it only &quot;petrifies&quot; you, doesn't even turn you to stone..., and monsters just continuing hitting on you with no damage taken, obviously, but when time runs out, guess what's still there...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Aww, ner%^&amp;e.&nbsp; Now I don't even want it anymore. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Jaedenar Adepts are in west of Felwood, around and in the caves called Jaednar.<br />I killed loads of them for 4 hours and still not a recipe. although I got an epic sword and an epic leather item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>LOL, just watched it, and yes it's hilarious!&nbsp; But it's not the use of the potion that the GM was warning him about, he was massively spamming &quot;KILL ME!&quot; in both /say and /yell.&nbsp; He spammed it so much that no one could say anything and they complained about it or Blizz has some way of monitoring massive abuse of macros like this (like checking for a message to be repeated 50 times within a minute or something).&nbsp; Yeah, this video is a keeper :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just read all comments and decided to vendor the Recipe, cuz this Flask is useless. Saving from Razorgore death? lol Divine Intervention lasts 3 minutes. Try it. ;)<br /><br />1x Black Lotus, 25g<br />10x Mountain Silv., 8g<br />30x Stonescale Oil, 180g<br /><br />So, 213g only for the Mats? 213g to save a Raid from a wipe?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>R you serious? If you're an alchemist, you most certanly have chosen to be a fisher and herbalist. You can gather the ingridients by yourself. Even though you're to greedy to &quot;waste&quot; the ingridients you acctually can sell the recipe at AH for those who would like the opportunity to use it... And earn some money on it too..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this recipe off a 51 non-elite at the farms in WPL while grinding Argent Dawn rep. I was extremely surprised to find that it sells for about 100g on my server, especially since the pot is clearly of debatable usefulness.<br /><br />The game certainly thinks it's something special, though, since the recipe vendors for 1g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The purpose of this potion is to function as the IceBlock spell that a frost mage should have.<br />It makes you immune for one minute.<br />Say you're a fire mage for example, in a raid group fighting a boss, you get a lucky crit chain, you draw aggro...that usually means you're dead because you'll be one-shotted. Drink this, and you are immune for 1 minute.<br />No, it doesn't drop your aggro and you can't do anything while you're under it's effect (but you probably can cancel it as in all buffs). What this gives you is time for the MT to gain aggro again. Very useful for clothies. After the MT has regain aggro, you cancel the effect and you can start spamming again.<br /><br />Is that so hard to understand? IceBlock is a life-saver in instances, and so is this potion.<br /><br />IT'S NOT FOR A TANK. It's for every class that is not supposed to be taking damage but accidentally gained aggro from a nasty boss. 1 minute is a very loooong time, it's more than enough for someone else to regain aggro. IceBlock just works for 15 seconds (I think) and is usualy enough anyway. <br /><br />Also, during that one minute you'll start to regain life and mana at normal rate. Maybe enough for some life saving spell when the effect wears off.<br /><br />This potion rocks! (unless you're a frost mage because i's very expensive and you get an almost free spell for the same effect)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For the record, this DROPS aggro. We just tested it... D:</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>against the bearer of this flask,<br />there can be no victory in WSG</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>But it only has 1 charge you would to bring a ton of these potions to WSG.<br />and plus isn't it like a pallys bubble?<br />If so it would drop the flag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is an Ice Block for anyone who wants it, not a DI. You can give it to a priest so that if the MT loses aggro or dies, they don't die while a tank regains aggro. I'm sure that this will decress aggro so that it will be easier for tanks to get it back. Combine with a fade, and your prists should be gravy. A tank can also use this at the last second before dieing so the boss will change targets for long enough for the warrior to get a heal and regain aggro, but much more useful for a priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I brought one of these to Maxx in Naxx, at 2% we were wiping so I thought now or never, big mistake on my part.&nbsp; I popped it then yelled dot her up, and everyone did.&nbsp; However, I did not heal myself 100% before flasking (shaman) so i was down to under 1000 hit points.&nbsp; <br /><br />After everyone wiped I did get all the agro, but it was ok, because I was immune...until Maxx did her webspray.&nbsp; I died to 1500+ Nature damage.&nbsp; After re-reading the flask...You're immune to physical damage.&nbsp; If I had healed all the way up I probably would have out lasted the dots and won.&nbsp; As it was, 1% wipe ftl.<br /><br />We did get Maxx down that night (first time to down her) but it took 3 more attempts, which adds up to alot in repair bills, plus all the NR pots we and mana pots and health pots that were popped in each attempt.&nbsp; Had it worked, I think it would have been weel worth the time it takes to farm the pots.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OMG that would be soo smart and cool and EXPENSIVE. Exept for the fact that Huhurans poison is not physical ^^ GL<br /><br />EDIT: This should be a re: on the post above.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;You turn to stone, protecting you from all physical attacks AND SPELLS for 1 minute..&quot;<br /><br />Note--Caps added for emphasis</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With the BC spells/talents all released, hunters will be a getting a spell at level 70 that diverts the aggro of their next 3 attacks to a person of their choosing. Have the MT drink this, which is normally mostly useless since the raid doing damage will take aggro back and you accomplish nothing. But now, a hunter rotation can keep generating aggro for you with that ability while the MT sits there taking 0 damage for a full minute. This is assuming that ability can be used on an MT while he's petrified, but maybe it works.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does this work well with Patchwerk?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got the recipe today in Burning Steppes....<br />I've been trygin to ask around for price ranges but nothing. I saw one up for bid for 148g and then someone tried to buy it off from me for 3g... wasn't sure if that was right or not. So...&nbsp; any suggestions on price range?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It'll go for a few hundred. Cheapest I've seen it go for on my server is 105g b/o. Expensive? Well, let's say it's about 500g if there's only one on. I usually see it go for 120g or so.<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />Edit 18th April: Just brought it out on the AH for 50g. I haven't seen this recipe since I posted my last comment, a few months ago so I decided to buy it today at a nice cost of 50g.<br /><br />With being level 70, I'm completing quests I never managed (or be bothered to do) at lower levels. I've still got every quest in Shadowmoon Valley and Netherstorm yet, so I'll be getting a lot of cash rewards :)<br /><br />At the end of the day, some people are going to say it's not worth the materials, but I collect materials a lot and if it drops aggro - it'll be great for those who gain too much threat in Karazhan, like myself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>even it might be cool to use it in a wipe, it is never ever worth the mats.<br />as there is always someone soulstoned or shami/pally or whatever to bring you to life again.<br />and about the aggro: dont waste your money in this flask! aggro-management ftw! ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>priapus</b></h3>Since no one has mentioned this in the comments, the reason this &quot;useless&quot; potion in 2006 is now invaluable on modern Hard Core servers is because you can basically bubble hearth if you use it correctly in a dungeon or raid.
