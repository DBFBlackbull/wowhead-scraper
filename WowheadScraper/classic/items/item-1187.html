<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Use it and lose it.<br /><br />The felhunter is level 30, and can be dangerous to use - he's a berzerker and will attack anything that gets near.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>does the felhunter stay summoned until it dies? or does it disappear when you log off?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i killed him toady and got collar, so he still drops it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>seen him 6 out of 8 times i was there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got this a bit ago on my lvl 28 paladin, immediately used it thinkin it'd have a cooldown, but it was a chatge. so i grinded for the next hour. its nice added dps. and has a decent bit of life/armor. it can be healed/buffed too. very nice.<br />Bliz should change this to a long cooldown, make it a trink maybe, or at least put on the item that it's a charge.<br />very nice. works exactly like the compact harvest reaper kits, the mechanical yetis, the dog whistle from SM, and other defensive combat pets.<br />again. very nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>man i was stoked on my daemonic beast then i hearthed and it was gone can you say LAME guess next time i well read stuff better<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Thistleroot gnome mages FTW</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yeah I got him and he left me a cloak. I'm mad because a rogue with a felhunter in PvP would look sweet. Also waiting for one group to die from a rare spawn or anything else is not stealing the kill. They had their chance and then any1 else can try. Good luck on finding the spawn time!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My little rogue was having a nice time in the catacombs, getting the best improved backstab.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He still exist i fight him last night(july 13). According to the book World of warcraft Atlas, the spawn rate of this monster its between 5-8hrs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to update this old thread, he still spawns inside the catacombs (January 2nd 2007). Killed him tonight by luck, dropped the colar, single use. He summons a sludge that died when it hit me because of thorns, so I guess the summoned is made to be one-shotted. He also uses shadow word pain and is single pull.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Killed him, dropped the collar.&nbsp; I've run 9 characters through the catacombs numerous times (I have one of each class on my realm) and have only seen this guy once.&nbsp; BUT!&nbsp; The Black Velvet Robes have dropped in there twice for me.&nbsp; Got it once.&nbsp; =]<br /><br />Still exists 02/01/2007</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got him once a few days ago with my 30 lock and got the collar. though already having the felhunter, i didnt care much about it and almost forgot about it. but then somethin came to me tonite, used it, and guess what; it stacks with the current felpuppy! 2 puppies at the same time! its great fun :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The hound doesn't even survive if you enter an instance (or whenever you get through the loading scren, like when sailing). I accidently acctivated it and the hound disappeared soon after after I sailed to Kalimdor...<br /><br />I'd rather have 5 1-min charges than 1 60-min charge...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Killed him, he spawned around 7:30 AM , he dropped the collar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To everyone asking about charges and drops:<br />This has 1 charge, when you use it it spawns a felhunter (looks just like the warlock one) and then it's gone unless you pick up a new one from lord Malathrom, a rare spawn in duskwood, no one else drops it. According to wowwiki Malathrom is on 5-8 hour spawn timer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>has only one charge, is agressive and lasted 15 min for me. :( Awesome looking though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just got one tonight. Sounds cool but I just hope it doesn't end up getting me killed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>January 11 and it's stil laround. But it only has one charge? What a waste! I wish it didn't...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>No I think its like other collars.<br /><br />You can use it when you want, but I bet this one has like a 24 hour cooldown.<br /><br />I'm gona go get one later this week so I'll try it out and report back.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>does anyone know if this item still exists after the recent updates? I went looking for it the other day and I could nott find it for the life of me. mainly if looking for it for BG in addition to the sheep and the harvester mech</div>
