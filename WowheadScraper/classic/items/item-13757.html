I spent 30 mins. fishing in 3 different areas for these fish from the list above. This is how it broke down. I started in EP @ 11:30PMish & caught 2,and also caught Armorfish. After 12AM server time, I didn't catch any more, and actually stayed here for about 10 more mins. just to be sure. Next, I went to the other side of the Silithus mountains, like the idiot above suggested, on the Ferelas side(The Forgotten Coast). I caught multiple fish at once there, but no Eels or Armorfish. Last, I went to Deadwind Pass. I did catch Armorfish there, but again, no Eels. I'm Alliance so I really can't go try Mojache, but at this point, I feel there may be something to the question that you can only catch the Eels during the day. I'll try during the day hours tomorrow & post an update with my findings. Good Luck!\nUPDATE: I went back to EP at about 10:30PM Server time & was able to catch 21 Eels & many Armorfish. I was watching the clock pretty close as Midnight came, and caught an Eel at 11:58PM. After Midnight I stayed & fished for another 40 Mins., and continued to catch Armorfish(Though way fewer), but no Eels. At this point, I'm going to say that there is definitely something to catching the Eels before 12AM Server time.

Lighting Eel CURRENTLY have no use, however have you ever heard of The BURNING CRUSADE?  yes this is an expansion for the game you and I both love.  now to answer all your question... Why are they here now?  Well at Blizzard, its important to keep things balanced in the WoW community (hint: nerfing items\/ character skills). Now you may ask, How does this have anything to do with Lighting Eel? EVERYTHING! Blizzard incorporated these into the game early so when the expansion does come out, the community stayes BALLANCED! (as least as much as they can control) This is so people (like you) start collecting these Eels and Plated Armor Fish.  This way when the expansion does come out, prices on these eels (and whatever they are going to be used for) dont skyrocket!  now there is always going to be the first rush. For example: when the Enchanted bags were released, [Greater Eternal Essence] prices increased dramatically because they were used in the making of these new bags that NO ONE had. This expansion is going to do the same thing. Prices are going to rocket up when all this new crap starts coming out. Now if there are Lighting Eel and Plated Armorfish already spread throughout the community, prices stay far more reasomable then if they were just released with all the new patterns and enchants and everything else. BALANCE is EVERYTHING!  So my final word and advice to YOU is: Dont eat\/feed them to your pets! and Stock Up!  cause when the expansion is released, you will be pulling in lots of $$$ either from the Eel themselves, or the products produced from them.","date":"2006-07-02T01:00:19-05:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"You realise these are for a quest that is already in game and your post makes you look like an idiot, right?","creationdate":"2006-07-03T11:00:24-05:00","id":1274088,"rating":3,"commentid":3048030,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Ulrind","importedSubject":"OMFG"},{"body":"The turnin quests will probably stay there for a long time.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, I have MAXED fishing(527). I spent 30 mins. fishing in 3 different areas for these fish from the list above. This is how it broke down. I started in EP @ 11:30PMish &amp; caught 2,and also caught Armorfish. After 12AM server time, I didn't catch any more, and actually stayed here for about 10 more mins. just to be sure. Next, I went to the other side of the Silithus mountains, like the idiot above suggested, on the Ferelas side(The Forgotten Coast). I caught multiple fish at once there, but no Eels or Armorfish. Last, I went to Deadwind Pass. I did catch Armorfish there, but again, no Eels. I'm Alliance so I really can't go try Mojache, but at this point, I feel there may be something to the question that you can only catch the Eels during the day. I'll try during the day hours tomorrow &amp; post an update with my findings. Good Luck!<br />UPDATE: I went back to EP at about 10:30PM Server time &amp; was able to catch 21 Eels &amp; many Armorfish. I was watching the clock pretty close as Midnight came, and caught an Eel at 11:58PM. After Midnight I stayed &amp; fished for another 40 Mins., and continued to catch Armorfish(Though way fewer), but no Eels. At this point, I'm going to say that there is definitely something to catching the Eels before 12AM Server time. Hope this was helpful!<br />UPDATE 2: I have made the decision the best time to catch these fish in an available area is between 6AM-12PM Server time.(Sunshine symbol)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You guys are either extremely slow or dont have the brains to put 1 and 1 together. Lighting Eel CURRENTLY have no use, however have you ever heard of The BURNING CRUSADE? yes this is an expansion for the game you and I both love. now to answer all your question... Why are they here now? Well at Blizzard, its important to keep things balanced in the WoW community (hint: nerfing items/ character skills). Now you may ask, How does this have anything to do with Lighting Eel? EVERYTHING! Blizzard incorporated these into the game early so when the expansion does come out, the community stayes BALLANCED! (as least as much as they can control) This is so people (like you) start collecting these Eels and Plated Armor Fish. This way when the expansion does come out, prices on these eels (and whatever they are going to be used for) dont skyrocket! now there is always going to be the first rush. For example: when the Enchanted bags were released, prices increased dramatically because they were used in the making of these new bags that NO ONE had. This expansion is going to do the same thing. Prices are going to rocket up when all this new crap starts coming out. Now if there are Lighting Eel and Plated Armorfish already spread throughout the community, prices stay far more reasomable then if they were just released with all the new patterns and enchants and everything else. BALANCE is EVERYTHING! So my final word and advice to YOU is: Dont eat/feed them to your pets! and Stock Up! cause when the expansion is released, you will be pulling in lots of $$$ either from the Eel themselves, or the products produced from them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>eKatherine</b></h3>This fish is eventually used in a Burning Crusade recipe. <br /><br />Stormchops<br />Use: Charges you with energy, causing lightning to occasionally zap nearby enemies for the next 30 minutes. <br /><br />The recipe is obtained from the barrel of fish obtained doing cooking dailies in Shattrath City. It's pretty rare. I eventually got mine by buying barrels of fish from the timewalking vendor when BC timewalking was in effect. <br /><br />Supposedly it is also possible to get it by doing cooking dailies in Dalaran Northrend. <br /><br />It's a not very useful gimmick. Basically it will aggro random critters as you walk by. <br /><br />It is easily fished in the Verdantis River in Feralas. My fishing is 300 and I don't need a lure.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Manqidawashere</b></h3>Not sure if the craftsmans writs for lightning eel will be a hot item in SoD but with all the surprising changes...it might be. I am going to hold them in the hundreds just to be safe. I fished with 3 toons in Moonglade for about 45 minutes and got 41. Fishing skill 175 with bright baubles still fails to catch fish there but my toons at 225 fishing never missed if they used the bauble but did miss without it. Either way, not sure I can really recommend going there altogether. Ended up with 138 raw redgill, 35 mithril trout, 85 raw sunscale salmon, 1 green boe (ok that surprised me) and 42 oily blackmouth. I am likely going to make my home base fishing hole that tiny lil pond in western winterspring once I can get there.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
