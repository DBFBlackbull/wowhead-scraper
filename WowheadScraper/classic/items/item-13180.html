<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item is MADE for the baron run. If you've tried and tried and can't make it, try stocking up on holy water from your &quot;practice&quot; runs. On the serious run, SPAM it EVERY cooldown you get!<br /><br />Holy water stacks to 50. The cooldown is 1 minute, and you have 45 to make it to baron. If everyone in your group has one full stack, you can <b>decimate</b> Stratholme by spamming these. <br /><br />5 people dropping the holy water bomb will do 2190-2810 AoE damage. This is enough to practically obliterate entire pulls in one fell swoop. Keep using the holy water, and you should have no problem making it to baron in time.<br /><br />If farming holy water isn't your thing, just check what cooldowns that it's shared with. There's still crystal charge and lots of dynamite at your disposal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried soloing this as a 62 Pally. I used an invisiblity potion to reach the first crate and was able to make the second crate too! Unfortunately, the first two crates are both dummy crates; the first proper one is the second one down on the left near the signpost and this one takes a while to open.<br /><br />I can use Devine Shield but I can't open the crate with it enabled. I've thought about target dummies but they won't last long enough. I tried it with another Pally - me pulling all the mobs and then hitting Devine Shield and him opening the crate but as soon as I hit DS, they all attacked him. It nearly worked though, he had it half way open.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We've just spent every evening this week farming Holy Water - two lvl 62 Retribution Pallys - and we've finally got them all. Very frustrating. We opted for the right hand path so after taking out the first group of five or six, there are two groups directly behind; we take the right group every time. This way we get to open the three crates that usually (not always) appear on the right; which includes the one just around the corner near to the gate. <br /><br />We thought that the first crates (left and right) were always dud but they're not - it's totally random and I did get a drop out of the first crate on the right. Another thing that we did was a self-sacrifice in order to identify the dud crates. This involves trying to open as many crates as possible using bubble, target dummies, invis potion, etc before dying. If we managed to identify a genuine one then we would fight our way to it after re-entering the instance, otherwise we hearthstoned back, got fixed, waited an hour and came back to a reset instance. Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I needed 5 of these things for the pally epic mount quest...as do a lot of you.<br /><br />What a pain in the ass!&nbsp; <br /><br />Getting a group together to go to Stratholme has been the hardest part of the quest so far.&nbsp; Especially since once i hit 62, Strat now longer shows up as an option in my LFG system.&nbsp; Stupid.<br /><br />Anyway, i finally got a group together.&nbsp; 2 of us pallys looking for H20.&nbsp; The 3 others just wanting to do Strat.&nbsp; It was a horribly unorganized group from the very beginning.&nbsp; But, luckily for me, nobody understood that everything was IN THE CRATES!&nbsp; I kept saying &quot;roll for the crates&quot;, but nobody was paying any attention to me.&nbsp; So i took them.&nbsp; All of them!&nbsp; 5 holy waters within 20 minutes (and at least 4 wipes).&nbsp; Then as soon as everyone's armor started turning red...i jumped on the bandwagon and disbanded.<br /><br />Lesson to be learned:&nbsp; Know what the hell you are doing before going in!&nbsp; This other pally had been on 3 or 4 Strat runs without getting a single holy water.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because he's dumb and i took them all from him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soloable as a 62 Prot spec Pally. You have to watch that you don't get any spectral citizens in with your pulls and that you don't get adds. I use Exorcism to pull since it has a long range, but Avenger's Shield would work even better if you're sure there's no citizens in the way, but it's mana costly.<br /><br />You'll have to utilize all of your abilities to do this solo. Divine Shield then bandage. Do not Holy Light, that eats precious mana. Keep Judgement of Light and Seal of Light up at all costs, pop Holy Shield every time Redoubt procs. Do not use Consecrate, it's a mana hog. Holy Wrath is very mana efficient vs the groups of 7 or 8 that you face at a time, but only if you have a large mana pool to begin with. Keep Imp. Righteous Fury up for the 6% dmg reduction, Ret Aura for much needed DPS and Imp. Blessing of Sanctuary for dmg reduction and reflected dmg. The Charm of Alacrity is invaluable here as well if you have it (you do have it by now, right?). Be sure to kill the casters first as the magic will eat you up faster than the melee and also so you can alternate between Divine Shield and Blessing of Protection since the magic will ruin your bandage attempts with BoP on. Remember to pop potions long before you need them so that when you do really need them the cooldown will be almost, if not completely over.<br /><br />Following this, you should be able to solo enough crates for your Epic mount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Otto61</b></h3>I'm seeing that most comments are old or relate to non-ClassicWoW experiences. So, I thought I'd note that this is probably not something that can be solo'd as a Paladin trying to get a mount. It may be possible with 2-3, but you'll probably want 4-5 to farm it multiple times. <br /><br />Why I couldn't solo it -<br /><ul><li>The first pull is a group of 4 non-elites around level 57, not that hard if you burn some cooldowns</li><li>The second pull is 4-5 non-elites and 2 elites at the same level which you might be able to kill in two tries... </li><li>... but you can't run out of the instance</li><li>... and it's not going to drop even if you get there</li><li>... last ditch option was to run in naked and open the crates in a bubble, but you're prevented from opening things while invulnerable</li></ul><br /><br />The best strategy is probably to just do strat live with a group. <br /><br />Or find enough people to go the many mobs on the right side of the instance towards the service entrance/exit on the dead side; reset and repeat as needed.</div>
