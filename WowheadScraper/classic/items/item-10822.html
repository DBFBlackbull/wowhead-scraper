This particular item drops from the Whelplings in the Badlands and Duskwallow Marsh as shown on the Dropped By Tab.<br /><br />Yes, there are other types of whelpling drops. Tiny Emerald Whelpling (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8498">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8498</a>) and Tiny Crimson Whelpling (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8499">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8499</a>).<br /><br />For some reason, this pet seems to usually sell for less than the Tiny Emerald Whelping. This is most likely due to the fact that there's less places to obtain the drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9247</b></h3>I found one of these on my rogue in badlands not too long ago, I grinded for a week at a rate of three hours a day and didnt find any till the seventh day. The drop rate seems lower than that of the crimson and emerald whelplings. If your a leatherworker you will make a lot of gold off of the skins of these guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>47019</b></h3>My name is Crimsonius from the terenas realm, I finnally got the dark whelpling pet after 35 hours over a 4 day weekend of farming scalding whelps in the badlands. This amounts to well over 4000 whelps dead. i started this at level 41 and finnally got one right after i leveled to 45. This is from only killing dark whelps. It looks really cool and goes well with what looks like my small army! (Im a hunter.) this pet gives you instant respect from others and is indeed a great conversation starter. I highly recommend hunting for dark whelplings in the badlands if your in the low 40s because in the duskwallow marsh farming can be very frustrating, There are usless searing hatchlings that look just like the searing whelps and lots of other powerfull mobs that loooove to gang up on the unsuspecting farmer!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>51302</b></h3>I got SUPER lucky with one of these little guys. First scalded whelp in the Badlands I killed dropped one. I didn't even know what it was until I checked it out. Makes the perfect pet for my gnome warlock, I say! I had no idea it was so rare though, talk about timing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed these damn things for nearly 8 lvls. I went everday to the Lethlor ravine thinking that i would get one as easily as I got my Emerald and Crimson whelps, but it took just a little while longer lol. I got my crimson after 4 hrs, my emerald after about 1 week of 2hrs+ per day, and fINALLY i got my dark whelpling yesterday after i had already been once that day, I decided to get back on and try a to kill just a few more..I killed 1, logged off for about 5 min to get dinner and then right as i relogged, one spawned and attacked me.....it was the one, i couldnt beleive it:) I had nearly given up but because whelplings give such good drops and exp i decided to go back that last time, lol. took long enough:)lol i'm a nerd.<br />Snorgara<br />lvl 47 troll hunter<br />Domination<br />Skullcrusher</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All this obsessing over how many mobs you had to whack to find your Dark Whelpling, and nobody answers half a dozen repeated questions from others saying Does It Do Anything?<br /><br />So listen up - NO, it doesn't do anything special, it's just a cosmetic pet toy like the tabby cat and horned owl and brown snake etc.<br /><br />The only difference is that it's very rare and different looking and guaranteed to start conversations when you summon it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I keep mine out as much as I can. He's good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A little while ago I've been farming for this whelpling for 2 days. So this guildie of mine was wondering what i was doing so long in the badlands. I told him that i was trying to get a whelpling and i killed over more then 2000 for it. He felt sorry for me and offered me a hand, so i agreed. He said that i could have the whelpling of course when it drops.<br />So we kill the last one of the south part and what you think it drops. And you never guess what, he picks it up and summons it. O.O ( grrrr ) so i kick him from our duo group and he asks why ....why? what you think yourself! and then he starts telling me he's so sorry. ( yeah whatever ) if i only would have known he would screw me over like that ... <br /><br />:( since then i never found another whelpling again</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>mine dropped when i was doing a Q in dustwallow.<br /><br />here's a pic near Dalaran&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e246/WAGONWINZ/whelpling.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e246/WAGONWINZ/whelpling.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've had a dark whelpling for a while now and today(7 april 2006) I got my disgusting oozeling.<br /><br />Tips if you don't wanna be bored while grinding, is to have a good guild with a funny guild chat, makes time fly away, this is what made me forget how boring it was when I was hunting for my dark whelpling :). <br /><br />Another tip is to read a web comic from the beginning to the end while you'grinding. I read pvponline.com while hunting for my oozeling, but you can also check out machall, gucomics, penny-arcade and ctrl-alt-delete. This only works for meele classes like druid, shaman, hunter, warrior and rogue. Maybe warlock can do it to with a little wanding. <br /><br />Podcasts is also nice :) Listening to &quot;The Dawn and Drew show&quot; while grinding Timbermaw rep :)<br /><br />Just shift your attention to something else other than the thing you're killing and it feels that it goes much faster :). <br /><br />Vote for me, cause these tips must be spread to the people :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me 12 and 1/2 hrs to get one, but I finally got one.&nbsp; There are two valleys where these things are, one to the north and one to the south of the big open area with the dragons.&nbsp; The one in the north is hard to get to, so I had it to myself much of the time.<br /><br />These are a 1 in 3000 drop, so be patient if you insist on getting one (much hate hate hate to those who got it first drop :P)<br /><br />I now have the complete set.&nbsp; 4 hours on the reds, 8 and 1/2 on the greens.&nbsp; My recommendation if you don't care which whelpling you get, go for the red.&nbsp; Much more mobs, lvl 24-26, and higher drop rate (1 in 1000).&nbsp; The darks are too rare and there aren't enough dreaming whelps, not to mention it stinks to have to kill the adolescents when they don't drop whelplings :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've grinded the red (not so long), green (3+ hours), and now the black (2+ hours).&nbsp; Rough guesses anyway.<br /><br />Not one of the whelplings yet, but I suspect that is because I have only dropped a few hundred of them.&nbsp; The odds are <i>against</i> me having one yet.<br /><br />I am not saying that everyone is lying on here, but I know that a good number of them are.<br /><br />Do the math on these and you'll see about a 1 in 4000 drop rate.<br /><br />Yes, it is possible (even probable) that a <b>couple</b> of people got lucky and dropped them fairly quickly.<br /><br />But as many as have posted here?&nbsp; Yeah right.<br /><br />I keep at them because they are good experience, drop quickly, and have decent drops.&nbsp; The prospect of getting a whelpling is a nice bonus that keeps my interest in grinding them a bit longer (rather than questing all the time).<br /><br />So those of you getting discouraged, you either have to realize that the odds are against you or suck it up and buy one from the auction house.<br /><br />Happy hunting.<br /><br />Level 41 Orc Hunter<br />Blackrock (PVP)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The thing to remember about the whelp drops, Not everyone that goes out will get it in the first 20 hours, or even the first 30, If you do keep going you will get one, But Then there are those that go in for 15 min and get two<br />For me on the red ones it was like that, level 24 and 25 both I got a whelp, didn't see another, started grinding on greens at level 30, Now at level 39 starting on blacks, I have never seen a green whelp drop, <br /><br />Things to remember while farming them, if you are farming for a whelp...don't Farm for the whelp, _and_ the cash, and flame sac's they drop, In my case for the skins as well... So much more satisfaction that way</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tried farming the Scalding Whelps in the Badlands for about an hour and a half so far. I think I killed a good 150 of them. I wish there were clustered together better, and more of them. Kind of slow to grind. All green/grey for me now, so very little to no XP, but easy to kill. <br /><br />I plan to go back and farm some more. I really want one of these rare whelpling pets. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took maybe 1 day of killing these things. Off to the AH I go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got mine after about 6 hours of grinding for the flame sacs to make the chili. Wasn't even looking for it. Good thing is I need the money to get my mount. Its so embarassing to be seen running around as a lvl 45 without a mount. Maybe I'll come back later for my own.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ive been farming the Badlands for about a week now..each nite ill go farm leather and drops for 1-2 hours and Hope I just get lucky for the pet drop..<br /><br />What do you know at 4 am I get lucky and while im farming/talking to guildies a strange Icon pops up under the loot menu, SWEET MOTHER OF THE ALMIGHTY ITS A PET! <br /><br />Well maybe not in those words, but the feeling you get is overwhelming..id say about 200 kills till I got mine^^<br /><br />GL to the rest of you..it is possible..shoot I had a friend get one after 3 KILLS! 3, thats right..just 3.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Do people in the AH <i>really</i> buy these things for 50g? I dont wanna get this, put it up for 50g and then keep getting no buyers...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this thing is worth 100+g and if you get it around level 40ish, the money is more important than the pet.<br /><br /> if you want it when you hit level 60 and are loaded with money. then just buy it then.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ive been farming for this thing for 2 days now, must have killed at least 500 of the Scalding Whelps in Badlands and no sign of the Dark Whelping and only 3 Green items :(:( Is it all just luck or does it depend on the level of the mob you kill?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just bought mines for 99s! Not kidding. I think i'm gonna sell it now :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Droprate seems to work separately for each level ( 41 - 43 in Badlands ), wich means i can kill more then 3000 of these before getting one whelpling. I'm working on getting one and i've passed the 0,07% droprate-chance on the collective.<br /><br /> Is it like this in instances? Feels like a friggin lottery.

I was happy, especially since I'm selling it and I am putting the money I earn off of it twords my debt.

Of course there is no such thing, but what if there is? If it's true that we're born w/ only a certain amount of luck, do you really want to burn that much of it on a cyber toy you're going to ditch in a year or less, anyway?<br /><br />I mean, burn up too much luck, and you could die tomorrow from a paper cut or something.<br /><br />I'd rather use my luck on winning the Lottery or dodging a major whammy ... still off I go to Wetlands for a crimson doodad....</div>

These guys were coming - a group - and a whelping started to chase them - but they were mounted - and I pulled it off them (and it was my fight - my pull).<br /><br />Killed it - and to my shock - I got my boy his little dragon pet!

Haven't had any success farming them myselves, but I have had the opportunity to take advantage of AH sellers who underestimate the value of this item. I got my own Dark Whelpling for just 5g in AH. That one I kept because I wanted a whelpling pet for myself. Later, though, I bought out another Dark Whelpling for 35g in AH, then resold it for 150g! That made my day.<br /><br />Now whenever I go to AH I do a quick search for whelplings to see if another such opportunity will present itself. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was farming whelps (and skinning and mining the area) for a few hours a couple nights ago. Killing the whelps both for the XP as well as hoping for a Dark Whelpling. Had to make numerous trips back to merch/mailbox to clean out my bags and was finally ready to quit. I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open. I was ready to head out of the area and had just called up my mount when I saw one more whelp. Figured why not. Went to kill it and sure enough, there was my Dark Whelping. I couldn't even auto-grab it as my bags were full. Had to throw something away just to fit it in. A mod I use showed that I had killed about 250 whelps, so I guess I beat the odds a bit.<br /><br />Now I have to decide if I -<i>really</i>- want to keep it, or if I want to sell it. That's a loss of a lot of potential gold just to keep a pet. Albeit the coolest pet in the game (in my opinion) but still. We'll see.<br /><br /><i>Edited, May 1st 2007 9:42pm by Lynchsta</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MacBeagle</b></h3>I remember, years ago, either in vanilla or, possibly early on in WoTLK, I got one of these as a drop. I didn't know it was anything special. I went ahead and opened the egg and started riding around with the pet. My daughter saw me playing with my little companion following along and almost screamed, &quot;where did you get that?&quot; When I <br />told her she explained that, at that time, on that server, people were paying about 3000G at the AH for one of them. I thought it was funny but none of my other toons has ever had one drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SpringFlower</b></h3>Got my Dark Whelpling today after 1,5 days farming. Got my first Dark Whelpling in vanilla after 6 hours farming, so this time was little harder. Server is Gehennas eu.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>haleykins86</b></h3>Finally got it to drop today off of an Ebon Whelp. Only 115 tries. Did this after I gave up on the Tiny Crimson Whelpling after 4970 attempts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nudelz</b></h3>I might be lucky, but I dropped 3 before getting close to 1k kills. Also they're not worth more than 20-30g on my server (Everlook-EU), so I doubt they're this rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WowFarmed</b></h3>It took 407 scalding whelpling kills to have this pet to drop and roughly 45 minutes. I went to the bottom right corner of badlands (Lethlor Ravine) and just worked my way through the field.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stripe1989</b></h3>I got mine on attempt 62.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ticks187</b></h3>Got it on my first kill on whelpling in Badlands:-O</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mfilos</b></h3>I got mine today by accident while farming Badland whelps and elites for the &quot;heart&quot; quest item for Blaze enchant...<br />It must have been my 5th-6th kill of the day so I definitelly feel sad for all these that farm it on purpose... :(<br />(...on the other hand I got my BRD arena chest from Gorosh after 273 tries...)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RedRockRun</b></h3>I'm on kill 281. Have gotten 53 sacs but still no whelpling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tauridxx</b></h3>Dropped from a Searing Whelp while doing the &quot;Identifying the Brood&quot; quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dayoodin</b></h3>I had been trying for weeks to get this pet. I killed hundreds (maybe thousands, I am not sure) of the Searing Whelps and Searing Hatchlings (this was in Dustwallow, not Badlands) and gained over three levels from just this effort. Yesterday, I installed a kill counter add-on so that I could provide a more accurate count of how many I had to kill and report here on it. This morning, I decided to spend an hour on this task. It dropped for me on the second kill from a Searing Whelp. I could hardly believe it. I have no idea if it is because I finally killed a required amount of hundreds or thousands or that today I just had extraordinary and unbelievable luck. But, my final report is that overall I did kill hundreds or thousands of these over several weeks to try get this pet. If you, too, are trying, don't give up. It will drop eventually.</div>
