She does not send you, but report back to the NE's in Ferales, and they send you with a fragile egg to see Quentin in Shimmering flats. He wants you to bring him 2 Elixir's of Fortitude.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here's how to get one. In Ferales by the Grimtotem camp, there are 2 NPC Night Elves on the hill across the pond next to the cage holding the sprite darters. First, they want you to assist in freeing some of the captured darters (5 or 6 min. timer). After that, they want you to kill some Grimtotems. Next, you take a Signet ring to High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind in Darnassus (Temple of the Moon). She does not send you, but report back to the NE's in Ferales, and they send you with a fragile egg to see Quentin in Shimmering flats. He wants you to bring him 2 Elixir's of Fortitude. Next, he sends you to Agnar Beastmaster in Hinterlands (1 hour timer). As you are about to become a parent, Agnar sends you to collect food for your hatchling, 5 Silvermane Stalker Flanks. Once you return with them, You have your Sprite Darter Egg. :)&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It really annoys me,to many things are alliance only.<br />prairie chicken: even tho it 's possible to get one with the horde by stealing one of a alliance.<br />That rod that change someone in a furbolg.<br />and, now they also get a fearie dragon?<br />it 's really a pain in the butt, i love these fearie dragons and i really looked forward to get one! :(<br /><br />besides, about the fearie dragons assisting the nightelfs in wc3.<br />fine.. then we should be able to get a duskbat pet, right?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Before turning in the elixers, mark your Hearthstone to Airie Peak.&nbsp; Takes the 1-hour time limit out of the picture.&nbsp; I am almost done with this - just need to turn in the elixers - servers messed up all weekend, making travel dangerous at best between continents.&nbsp; Myself and a hunter guildmate breezed through the first parts of this quest (he was 46, I am 47 rogue) and the fighting in the first part is chaotic at best.&nbsp; The wolves you kill in Hinterlands are the ones near the coast that shadow-out, like the shadow catss in STV.<br /><br />As I am a &quot;pet hor&quot; I have to get this.&nbsp; I have almost one of every pet in the game (including a crimson whelping) and am working on the dark and emerald whelpings.&nbsp; And, the Worg Puppy is NOT a hoard only pet.&nbsp; There is also a spider hatchling in the same area as the worg puppy.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mrc.soton.ac.uk/lstyles/LBRSWorgPupGuide/LBRSWorgPupGuide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrc.soton.ac.uk/lstyles/LBRSWorgPupGuide/LBRSWorgPupGuide.htm</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>coordinates: 65,45<br />Jer'kai Moonweaver and Kindal Moonweaver.. forgot to write the quest name down</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When you get into Lower Wilds in Feralas, go left into that grimtotem camp.&nbsp; Keep left a little.&nbsp; There is a tree near a structure in the camp.&nbsp; To the left of the tree is a very small mountain path, on the edge of the mountain there.&nbsp; Go up it, takes you a lil down, there are the 2 night elves.<br /><br />Hint:&nbsp; Before starting the first quest, Freedom to all Creatures, clear the area near the sprite darter cage.&nbsp; And when 6 survive, and Kindal survives, it will tell you complete.&nbsp; It won't tell you complete if 6 sprites don't survive, so kill anything attacking them.&nbsp; Then you go back up, wait for her to respawn, and talk to her.&nbsp; Then you talk to Jer'kai.&nbsp; Then you complete her quest.<br /><br />That's where i am at now.&nbsp; Hope that helps starters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a lvl 44 lock doing the quest to get this pet right now.&nbsp; Locks can get pets, i have like 5 already.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The above comment is correct, except the Night Elves are in Feralas, not Ashara. Other than that following the directions and you'll have your sprite darter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; I agree with the post above that said &quot;I wouldnt mind not being able to get this pet, if there was some pet that was horde exclusive also.&quot;&nbsp; Well being a small pet fanatic in WoW (have pretty much everything except the collecter edition ones, and this), I can tell that you there is no pet in this game that alliance cannot get somehow (either through neutral AH, or some hard quest).&nbsp; HOWEVER, there was 1 pet we (horde) finally had in the latest patch that alliance couldnt get...and that was the tranquil mechanical yeti.&nbsp; Well now blizzard has decided to move that NPC from Org (that obviously attacked ally) to Everlook, how sweet of them.&nbsp; So now alliance in some way shape or from can get any pet they want in this game...While this is 100% impossible for horde since NPC attacks you, and cant be sold in neutral AH cause its BoP.&nbsp; Just thought I would type this so no horde waste his time...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ANYONE on the Alliance side can obtain one of these, they do not attack, they do not give passive effects, they are the same as every other pet aside the look... Horde can't get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>whatz her name?....?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The quest chain posted her is correct. i did this quests myself and got the stupid pet now :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Because the previous posts didn't help me find the quest to start the line for the pet I had to post a new one.<br /><br />OK.. ON THE EAST side of Dire Maul there is a camp of guys just north of the road.&nbsp; You will see a small cage w/ several sprite darters in it.&nbsp; If you are facing directly north, to the west there is a little body of water and then west a bit more there is a HUGE tree.&nbsp; West of the tree is a small path headed behind the tree up a big hill and then down a bit to a ledge where the elves are w/ the FIRST QUEST!&nbsp; ...IT IS TIMED...&nbsp; I picked it up and then didn't pay attention that it was timed and had to drop it right away because I was afk for a bit.&nbsp; The quest giver will disappear but then come back.<br /><br />I'd say the quest is lower than 45+..but im 50 so I don't really care.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>a troll horde was killing sprite darters while i did this quest , after i open the cage the troll went in there and was attacking them , sooner or later the cage closed , hunter inside , GG. She was begging me to let her out , so i had to log over to horde and tell her to hearth cause the key was gone. Pretty funny&nbsp; nevertheless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's a blue chameleon with butterfly wings ... weird pet.&nbsp; But i want one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a collecter of rare pets I was shocked to hear this could be, and ever more shock when I heard it was ally only. Im a Tauren druid and collect pets. Got an owl(ally pet), all 3 welps, the worg, the spider, the ozzeling,and now I want this so bad. Now when I was about 20, I think I saw an Unead with this, and I think someone above said they did too. And I also saw above that horde can get this in Silverpine Forest near SFK from a dalarn person. Can any one conferm or deny this? Any answers would be very helpful.&nbsp; <br /><br />Guild master of Havok, Unknowdruid<br />55 Tauren Druid<br />Thunderlord(PvP)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been wanting this little guy since about ...oh level 15 or so when I saw him.&nbsp; I finally got him 5 days ago and he makes my day brighter! :) Some people might not understand wanting to go through the work to get him, but it's worth it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this quest is easy peasy as long as you know what to do...2 parts of the quest chain are timed...actually i think it might be 3 but nontheless... 1 thing i advise before starting the hcain is gettin 2 elixir of fortitude as u will need them for part of the quest chain...but I think its well worth it =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im a night elf druid and i went to kinal moonweaver in feralas and she will not give me the first quest freedom for all creatures. <br />Why wont kinal give me the quest?<br /><br />do you need to be exalted with darn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, since we can do it earlier than the required lvl, what lvl you guys think we should try this quest minimum?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>IT APPEARS you need to be 42 to start quest line, and need to be 46 to do the last part!<br /><br /><b>1)</b><u>&quot;Freedom For All Creatures&quot;</u><br />Obtained at lev 42<br /><b>Timed,free darters with key provided</b><br />This quest is given from the Night Elves in Feralis near the Tauren camp just east of the Dire Maul entrance.&nbsp; You must go behind the huge tree to the west of the camp up a hill to get to the elves.<br /><br /><b>2)</b><u>&quot;Doling Justice&quot;</u><br />Obtained at lev 40<br /><b>Kill Count, kill like crazy</b><br /><br /><b>3)</b><u>&quot;Doling Justice&quot;</u><br />Obtained at lev 41<br /><b>Just go to Temple of the Moon in Darnassus up stairs for reward</b><br /><br /><b>THEN BACK TO FERALAS</b><br /><br /><b>4)</b><u>&quot;Unhatched Sprite Darter Egg&quot;</u><br />Obtained at lev 41<br /><b>Sends you to race way in Thousand Needles</b><br />BRING 2 Elixir of Fort to Thousand Needles to save time!<br /><br /><b>5)</b><u>&quot;A Short Incubation&quot;</u><br />Obtained at lev 41<br /><b>Give him the Elixirs</b><br /><br /><b>Off to Hinterlands</b>..Timed, you have 1 hour!<br /><br /><b>6)</b><u>&quot;Food For Baby&quot;</u><br />Obtained at lev 46<br /><b>Gotta kill some wolves..</b> Mostly east side I think, and I hear reports of them being as high as lev 48.<br /><br /><b>7)</b><u>&quot;Becoming a Parent&quot;</u><br /><br />------<br /><br />I think that is all.. sry I didn't have links for the quests themself but you can look em up easy if you need more info than that.&nbsp; Also the 'obtained at lev' info doesn't make much sence but I just wrote what the quest said.<br /><br />IF you know your way around the zones of the game and are high enough lev to breeze through this, the whole thing starts in Feralas, just once you end in Darnassus you have to remember to go back to Feralas.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER-- I may have not wrote everything down exactly right, but if you know how to read quests, you will get the idea.&nbsp; When you start the line just keep in mind the 2 timed parts, and you will need 2 elixirs of fortitude.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>it rulez. easy quest, takes some time though and luckily im an alchemist for 1 part of the quest<br />not much people have it, while the quest is so easy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm trying to get all the dragon pets but alas I am horde, I've already got the Crimson, working on Emerald but then I heard about this pet...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's Bind on Pickup, so you won't be able to get one as horde no matter what.<br /><br />Quest rewards are always Bind on Pickup.</div>
