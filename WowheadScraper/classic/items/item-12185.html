Some of these quests include the following.\n\n- Cannot fly into or out of Booty Bay, Un'Goro Crater, Gadgetzan, or Flame Crest safely, as both the Flight Path Masters are guaded by at least one Bruiser, and will attack you as they are loyal to Steamwheedle.\n- Unable to use the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay Safely.\n- Unable to participate in the weekly fishing contest as you will not be able to turn in the tastyfish to win the competion, get money for the extra fish, or turn in any of the rare fish.\n\nIf you're willing to destroy your reputation with the goblin cities just to get a hat and the Blood Parrot, and also willing to sacrifice the time and money to repair your rep, Then you need to know how to get the quest...\n\nOnce you finally get to Friendly status with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, you need to go south of Booty bay to the middle of the three Pirate ships there and talk with Fleet Master Firallon. He will then give you the quest [60] Avast, me harties! This quest sends you into the heart of booty bay. At the top of the Inn building, you will have to kill Baron Revilgaz, and Fleet Master Seahorn, which will obviously spawn guards as soon as you attack them.\n\nThe reward for this quest is the Bloodsail Admiral's Hat, which you can use to summon your Blood Parrot. If you get too far away from a bruiser, they will stop running after you and pull out their guns, and that means game over. They will not put away their guns once they pull them out for at least 5 minutes. The problem with their guns is that they knockback like an ogre hammer. And they will keep firing, which can and will make you go from one side of the town or area to the other.\nThis makes killing the bruisers or the leaders next to impossible, so you have to do this all without getting far enough away the bruisers break out their guns instead of running after you!\n\nIt is not a mission to be taken lightly, as you must destroy your reputation which will take many hours to do so, and countless more to restore your reputation...\nRealistically it will take at least a week or two to farm the reputation to do the quest, and at least a month or so to recover your reputation with the goblin cities afterward so that you can quest, help guildes...and go around the world of azeroth without getting attacked, caught in nets, and killed.","date":"2007-03-20T11:02:39-05:00","rating":141,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Does the title bloodsail admiral appear next to your name because if so then its worth it :D Besides with outlands being the way it is thats about a weeks worth of questing to get it done to have enough g.","creationdate":"2007-04-10T16:53:08-05:00","id":293632,"rating":1,"commentid":54211,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"viva","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":8,"id":77049,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"48405","body":"anyone know if a lvl 19 twink can get this with the help of one or a few lvl 70 friends helping? thx for answers!","date":"2007-05-03T09:53:41-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":9,"id":77879,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Breanni","body":"A detailed guide for obtaining this item (and the pet it summons) can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.warcraftpets.com\/guides\/pets\/bloodsail.asp\r\n\r\nGood luck!","date":"2007-05-04T19:16:45-05:00","rating":15,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":85766,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Creature","body":"I recieved mine after about several weeks of on and off grinding of the Booty Bay guards.

Both factions friendly is possible in this manner.\nCloth turn-in quests become available at Unfriendly, but normal restrictions apply so you all you can turn in as lvl 19 is Linen (Ratchet).\n\nAt 19 neither quest is available, for pirate outfit and for the hat.

I wanted to see how much rep loss with Booty Bay there is if you get someone to help you.  I think at level 60, the quest should be relatively soloable (with difficulty maybe) but if you do get a healer friend or someone to help, here's what they can expect:\n\nFleet Master Seahorn (pirate cow) kill = 75 rep loss with booty bay\nBaron Revilgaz (goblin swashbuckler) kill = 375 rep loss with booty bay\n\n\nNot too bad if you've done a handful of quests in booty bay already.  Nothing that's going to get you 'hated' with them or anything.\n\nWhen I thought the baron and fleet master were elite (don't know what gave me that idea) I was tentatively asking around to see if any wanted to help me, and the biggest response I got was \"how badly will it hurt my booty bay rep\" so I thought I'd find out.\n\nAlso, because I like to be considerate of other players and these are NPCs that you turn quests in to sometimes, I checked out the respawn times before I left town.\n\nThe cow respawned in about 8 minutes and the baron respawned in about 3 minutes.  So if people @#$%^ at you for killing their NPCs, let them know that it shouldn't last more than 5-10 minutes.\n\n\nAnd a big dorky shout-out to the undead rogue on Bloodhoof who warned me \"I'm keeping an eye on you\" when he saw me kill the guys and didn't seem happy with my explaination that it was for a quest.

Some of these quests include the following.\n- Unable to obtain any other parts of the Tier 0.5 gear than the bracers, as the next part in the chain requires you to speak to a member of the Cartel.\n- Cannot fly into or out of Booty Bay, Un'Goro Crater, Gadgetzan, or Flame Crest safely, as both the Flight Path Masters are guaded by at least one Bruiser, and will attack you as they are loyal to Steamwheedle.\n- Unable to use the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay Safely.\n- You will be cut off to certain quests in high level dungeons such as the \\\"Dawn's Gambit\" quest in Scholomance.\n- Unable to get the Shadowforge key, as the quest chain to get the key to Scholomance involves going to Gadgetzan and forming the shaft of the key.\n- Cannot go past 225 in Blacksmithing as the quest chains to become an Armorsmith or a Weaponsmith both require you to speak to member of the Cartel.\n- Cannot go past 225 in Engineering as the only person who can train you is of Gadgetzan faction. \n- Horde players will also be unable to become Goblin and Gnomish engineers, and Alliance players will be unable to become Goblin engineers.\n- Unable to participate in the weekly fishing contest as you will not be able to turn in the tastyfish to win the competion, get money for the extra fish, or turn in any of the rare fish.\n- The Burning Crusades expansion is going to be adding more quests that involve Gadgetzan and\/or the Steamwheedle Cartel, and that means that you will not be able to do them if you are not at least neutral.\nIf you're willing to destroy your reputation with the goblin cities just to get a hat and the Blood Parrot, and also willing to sacrifice the time to repair your rep, Then you need to know how to get the quest...\nOnce you Finally get to Friendly status with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, you need to go south of Booty bay to the middle of the three Pirate ships there and talk with Fleet Master Firallon.\nHe will then give you the quest [60] Avast, me harties!\nThis quest sends you into the heart of booty bay. At the top of the Inn building, you will have to kill Baron Revilgaz, and Fleet Master Seahorn, which will obviously spawn guards as soon as you attack them.\nThe reward for this quest is the Bloodsail Admiral's Hat, which you can use to summon your Blood Parrot.\nIf you get too far away from a bruiser, they will stop running after you and pull out their guns, and that means game over.  They will not put away their guns once they pull them out for at least 5 minutes.\nThe problem with their guns is that they knockback like an ogre hammer.  And they will keep firing, which can and will make you go from one side of the town or area to the other.\nThis makes killing the bruisers or the leaders next to impossible, so you have to do this all without getting far enough away the bruisers break out their guns instead of running after you!\nIt is not a mission to be taken lightly, as you must destroy your reputation which will take many hours to do so, and countless more to restore your reputation...\nRealistically it will take at least a week or two to farm the reputation to do the quest, and at least a month or so to recover your reputation with the goblin cities afterward so that you can quest, help guildes...\nand go around the world  of azeroth without getting attacked, caught in nets, and killed.\nLastly I should mention the fact that you will spend much gold on the bandages and healing potions needed while farming the reputation to get the quest, and repariing your reputation after.\nThere are several ways to get your reputation with Booty Bay and the goblin cities back, but there is only one that I know of and have found that will level your rep with them without affecting your Bloodsail rep.  This is the Shrik Ze Giants quest in Feralas given by the goblin on the west coastline of Feralas.\nI personally spent over 300 gold on bandages, mats for bandages, healing potions, and equipment repairs just getting to the quest, and at least twice as much getting my reputation back to neutral afterwards with the goblins.\nUnless you are lvl 60, very bored, have nothing better to do with a month or two of your time, and tons of gold, and dont care about not being able to travel to help friends\/guildies then its really not worth doing.\nEnd of tutorial.\nSeravais Lvl 60 Undead Rogue US - Medivh - Horde\n[URL=http:\/\/wow.allakhazam.com\/profile.html?1179058]Seravais' Inventory, and equiped gear at last logout (usually my pirate outfit, Fire Resist gear, or normal garb)[\/URL]","date":"2006-10-19T10:10:03-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Seravais","importedSubject":"Becoming a Bloodsail Admiral"},{"commentv2":1,"number":65,"id":3037403,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I decided to go for it with my 57 hunter since I'm kind of bored with him anyhow... \"Bruiser\" is no joke.

Doing it in this order is cheaper and less time consuming on farming for the materials.\nNot many people have this hat, so its worth it just to be unique or if you just want to be a true pirate.\n\nRagefire Chasm \/ The Deadmines = Linen\nScarlet Monastery = Silk\nNetherguarde mines = Mageweave\nRunecloth = Deadwind pass\n\nNoyjitat 60 Undead Rogue - Lightbringer","date":"2006-12-03T10:03:19-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Noyjitat","importedSubject":"Well worth the sacrifice and time"},{"commentv2":1,"number":68,"id":3037406,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"[quote]So for the most part, if you see someone wearing this hat, its the equivalent of carrying around a big sign that says \"Kill me I'm allergic to I.Q.\" [\/quote] \n\nNot exactly, from the reasons posted not to get the hat, they aren't all that bad.  I am a rogue, therefore I can stealth on the boats, no problem.  Flying to Gad. is a pain...  But evasion, sprint, and a vanish to break a net and I'm okay.\n\nFor most classes, I've heard the Tier 0.5 is a waste of time and money.  For the rogues it definatly is, the rogues that I know who have done it even say so.  I suppose it isn't too bad if you aren't in a guild you'd actually get tier 1, but in that case, you have a whole different problem.  You could at least go for PvP gear instead of the upgrades.  In my oppinion, seeing someone walk around in tier 0.5 would make me worry about their I.Q. more than if they had the hat.  But I don't really think getting tier 0.5 and the hat are a matter of I.Q., more of oppinion I would suppose.\n\nBlacksmithing, do it on a different char, though I admit that it is good to know that you need Steamweedle to go past 225 for anyone who is thinking about going for the hat.\n\nFinally, there are ways to get your rep back up with Steamweedle, just because someone has the hat doesn't mean they are still hated.  There are goblins outside each city where you can turn in cloth for rep, also there are mobs you can grind...  A pain, but if you want that hat, and still be able to get Noggenfogger, it's worth it.\n\nFor someone who has the hat, the only drawback for me is not getting Noggenfogger, luckly I enjoy it on my alts.  :P","date":"2006-12-04T16:33:08-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"rawkziex","importedSubject":"My Hat <3"},{"commentv2":1,"number":69,"id":3037407,"nreplies":3,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"certain mobs in booty bay you can kill, will ONLY lower booty bay faction, but still gain bloodsail faction.  if you work those you shouldn't have a problem with the other goblins.","date":"2005-03-30T00:49:28-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Which mobs?","creationdate":"2005-03-30T01:17:47-06:00","id":1271205,"rating":-5,"commentid":3037407,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Kendow","importedSubject":"RE: well"},{"body":"hmm had to answer my own question. basically any mobs that arent of the goblin race (ie humans, taurens, gnomes,etc) do not lower rep from the other goblin towns (ie Gadge, everlook, etc).

Some of these quests include the following.\n- Unable to obtain any other parts of the Tier 0.5 gear than the bracers, as the next part in the chain requires you to speak to a member of the Cartel.\n- Cannot fly into or out of Booty Bay, Un'Goro Crater, Gadgetzan, or Flame Crest safely, as both the Flight Path Masters are guaded by at least one Bruiser, and will attack you as they are loyal to Steamwheedle.\n- Unable to use the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay Safely.\n- You will be cut off to certain quests in high level dungeons such as the \\\"Dawn's Gambit\" quest in Scholomance.\n- Unable to get the Shadowforge key, as the quest chain to get the key to Scholomance involves going to Gadgetzan and forming the shaft of the key.\n- Cannot go past 225 in Blacksmithing as the quest chains to become an Armorsmith or a Weaponsmith both require you to speak to member of the Cartel.\n- Cannot go past 225 in Engineering as the only person who can train you is of Gadgetzan faction. \n- Horde players will also be unable to become Goblin and Gnomish engineers, and Alliance players will be unable to become Goblin engineers.\n- Unable to participate in the weekly fishing contest as you will not be able to turn in the tastyfish to win the competion, get money for the extra fish, or turn in any of the rare fish.\n- The Burning Crusades expansion is going to be adding more quests that involve Gadgetzan and\/or the Steamwheedle Cartel, and that means that you will not be able to do them if you are not at least neutral.\nIf you're willing to destroy your reputation with the goblin cities just to get a hat and the Blood Parrot, and also willing to sacrifice the time to repair your rep, Then you need to know how to get the quest...\nOnce you Finally get to Friendly status with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, you need to go south of Booty bay to the middle of the three Pirate ships there and talk with Fleet Master Firallon.\nHe will then give you the quest [60] Avast, me harties!\nThis quest sends you into the heart of booty bay. At the top of the Inn building, you will have to kill Baron Revilgaz, and Fleet Master Seahorn, which will obviously spawn guards as soon as you attack them.\nThe reward for this quest is the Bloodsail Admiral's Hat, which you can use to summon your Blood Parrot.\nIf you get too far away from a bruiser, they will stop running after you and pull out their guns, and that means game over.  They will not put away their guns once they pull them out for at least 5 minutes.\nThe problem with their guns is that they knockback like an ogre hammer.  And they will keep firing, which can and will make you go from one side of the town or area to the other.\nThis makes killing the bruisers or the leaders next to impossible, so you have to do this all without getting far enough away the bruisers break out their guns instead of running after you!\nIt is not a mission to be taken lightly, as you must destroy your reputation which will take many hours to do so, and countless more to restore your reputation...\nRealistically it will take at least a week or two to farm the reputation to do the quest, and at least a month or so to recover your reputation with the goblin cities afterward so that you can quest, help guildes...\nand go around the world  of azeroth without getting attacked, caught in nets, and killed.\nLastly I should mention the fact that you will spend much gold on the bandages and healing potions needed while farming the reputation to get the quest, and repariing your reputation after.\nThere are several ways to get your reputation with Booty Bay and the goblin cities back, but there is only one that I know of and have found that will level your rep with them without affecting your Bloodsail rep.  This is the Shrik Ze Giants quest in Feralas given by the goblin on the west coastline of Feralas.\nI personally spent over 300 gold on bandages, mats for bandages, healing potions, and equipment repairs just getting to the quest, and at least twice as much getting my reputation back to neutral afterwards with the goblins.\nUnless you are lvl 60, very bored, have nothing better to do with a month or two of your time, and tons of gold, and dont care about not being able to travel to help friends\/guildies then its really not worth doing.\nSide note: The only reason why I did any of this in the first place is because A) I have 6 Parrots in real life, B) The blood parrot was one of the only pets aquirable by horde characters that I did not have, and C) I knew I was crazy enough and bored enough to take the time to not only get the quest done, but to restore my reputation afterwards.\nEnd of tutorial.\nSeravais Lvl 60 Undead Rogue US - Medivh - Horde\n[URL=http:\/\/wow.allakhazam.com\/profile.html?1179058]Seravais' Inventory, and equiped gear at last logout (usually my pirate outfit, Fire Resist gear, or normal garb)[\/URL]","date":"2006-10-19T10:05:47-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"So for the most part, if you see someone wearing this hat, its the equivalent of carrying around a big sign that says \"Kill me I'm allergic to I.Q.\"\n\n[quote=Seravais]Right now on my server there are only 5 of us on the Horde side that have this item that I am aware of, and 2 on the alliance side.\nI am constantly getting questions and reactions to having this hat, especially when participating in the weekly fishing contest.\nSo I am going to post as thorough tutorial of how to become a Bloodsail Admiral here, and all the Insane cons of doing so.\nOk, I have gotten many requests about this, being ","creationdate":"2006-12-02T23:00:38-06:00","id":1271210,"rating":0,"commentid":3037412,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Sahvang","importedSubject":"Tutorial\/Info on becomming a Bloodsail Admiral"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Seravais","importedSubject":"Tutorial\/Info on becomming a Bloodsail Admiral"},{"commentv2":1,"number":75,"id":3037413,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"why ruin rep when you can tailor an Admiral's Hat with a stamina buff for you and your party?

You have to kill Steamwheedle Cartel goblins in order to do this. Once you get Friendly, you have to do a simple quest to kill two npcs in Booty Bay.<br /><br />You also can get Bloodsail clothing for being Neutral with them.<br /><br />Beware, by gaining reputation with Bloodsail Buccaneers, you will become hated and kill-on-sight for many goblins. Ratchet, Booty Bay, Gadgetzan, and Everlook will be unaccessible. Thus, you will have absolutely no access to neutral auction houses.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7043</b></h3>With TBC so close there is no point in getting this hat because as Minorou has said, you will become kill on sight.<br /><br />This is especially bad for you if you plan to go to the new instance &quot;The Caverns of Time&quot; for Gadgetzan will most likely be the repair spot for there. <br /><br />No one wants to fly all the way to Un'goro to repair even if it's with a cool hat =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ace22b</b></h3>There is repair spot/reagent vendor in caverns of time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Minorou</b></h3>Ah, another thing to note is that the goblins in the Outlands will not be affected by your reputation in Azeroth. You can be Hated with Steamwheedle Cartel and still be fine talking to goblins in the new dimension.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8876</b></h3>As an aside, if you recieve this hat it is still possible to become friendly again with the Steamwheedle Cartel. By completing the previously mentioned quest 1-2 times, you can return to neutral with the Buccaneers. After that, its just a grind fest on pirates to get back to neutral with the cartel. Long, yes, but this hat is pretty awesome, and you wont see many around.<br /><br />besides, if you can kill the goblins, it isn't too difficult to kill the pirates who are MUCH weaker.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9391</b></h3>tydie, you say that the closest repair site near the caverns of time is in Gadgetzan.

And they will keep firing, which can and will make you go from one side of the town or area to the other.<br />This makes killing the bruisers or the leaders next to impossible, so you have to do this all without getting far enough away the bruisers break out their guns instead of running after you!<br /><br />It is not a mission to be taken lightly, as you must destroy your reputation which will take many hours to do so, and countless more to restore your reputation...<br />Realistically it will take at least a week or two to farm the reputation to do the quest, and at least a month or so to recover your reputation with the goblin cities afterward so that you can quest, help guildes...and go around the world of azeroth without getting attacked, caught in nets, and killed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Creature</b></h3>I recieved mine after about several weeks of on and off grinding of the Booty Bay guards. The farming of the guards becomes very boring and repetitive after a short time and be prepared to pay money for repair costs as the guards have a tendency to appear from no where and gang up on you. I suggest you recruit a friend to help you out every so often as to stop the boredom. Being hated with steamwheedle is a small price to pay for this great item as the steamwheedle faction is useless in Outland. Good luck me harties!<br /><br />Fuel- BoulderfistEU</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You need to kill Booty Bay Bruisers/etc. until you are friendly with Bloodsail. Yes, it will take alot of Bruisers because the amount of &quot;rep points&quot; to get through hated is much greater than the amount of &quot;rep points&quot; held by honored, friendly, neutral, and unfriendly combined. <br /><br />Once you do that, you can talk to the bloodsails and get a quest from their leader located on one of the ships.&nbsp; The quest will be to kill the fleet commander in BB. Once that's done, you can get your faction back up with wastewander guys or w/e.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stumpington - warlock<br />guild: Band of the Red Eye<br />First on Whisperwind to get Bloodsail Admiral Hat<br /><br />Easiest way to do this?&nbsp; If you're level 60 and have done all of the bloodsail quests in booty bay durring your 30-40's it's going to take a long time... so plan ahead and don't do any of the quests that require you to kill pirates (It took me 2 months because I did all of these quests).<br /><br /><b>Grinding alone</b>: Kill the bruisers in the tunnel leading into booty bay over and over and over.<br /><br /><b>Grinding with a priest</b>:&nbsp; Make sure the priest is not partied.&nbsp; <u>Warlocks only</u> basically - Get the priest a crap ton of crystal water and make your way into booty bay, take a left when you get out of the tunnel.&nbsp; You'll eventually get to the first shop - just to the left of this shop plant yourself and your voidwalker - there is a bruiser that will automatically spawn about 3 seconds after you kill him right here.&nbsp; Just stand there and kill for hours.&nbsp; Your priest will not loose faction and you can life tap to get mana back.&nbsp; The priest can also stop healing for a few seconds to get out of combat and drink whenever needed.&nbsp; Note: the priest needs to be level 60 - anyone lower level will loose faction for some reason.<br /><br />Once you get the quest - the priest will have to loose 250 faction for the last part of the quest - just die in the water under the inn - res yourself on the top floor and have the priest partied with you for shield, etc.&nbsp; At this point it's easy - without the priest/shield it's really really hard - the bruisers will pull our their guns and it's all over.<br /><br />I havn't tried yet but if in-fact you can kill the crabs to get bloodsail points - do this before you get to 50+ - because at that point you'll only get 1 point per kill (note: i haven't confirmed that the crabs give points yet... i'm going to try soon)<br /><br />Once you are finished with the quest head to tanaris and start doing the repeatable quests to gain cartel faction - in about 60 hours or so you'll be friendly with all cartel except for booty bay - once you hit friendly with them it's another 50 hours or so to get friendly faction with booty bay. (this all depends on how bad your faction was with the bloodsails before you started killing bruisers... mine was about halfway down hated).<br /><br />Also to note - once you hit 0 hated with booty bay you'll stop loosing faction with all cartel - at this point it's nice because you won't get too low with the other cartel places - all my cartel was about halfway to 0 by the time i got to 0 with booty bay.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well.. i though that this hat would be awsome to get.<br />So now i've been farming the guys in arathi for 4 days. Finaly got to friendly with the bloodsails, and utterly hated with booty (can't be anymore hated than this).<br />So i went to the captain to get the quest.<br />Well what do i see..<br />Something i didn't think of. The quest level.<br />Well.. me being 45 now (started grinding on 40) can't get the quest.<br /><br />So unless you're very close to 60 don't got for this.<br />Well.. guess i'll have to go farm some rep with booty then :P<br /><br />Cheers</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>-You do need to be friendly with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, not doing the earlier quests that involves killing them helps with this.<br /><br />-The Blood Parrot cannot be summoned with another pet, I tested this with my other parrot.<br /><br />-There is a level requirement, I believe it is 50, but I can't confirm that.<br /><br />-Killing Booty Bay guards is the quickest, with 25 rep a piece, but still slow. Most do spawn a partner when you aggro them.<br /><br />-Once you have the quest, the easiest way to get to them &lt;on horde side&gt; is to fly from Grom'Gol, they are right next to the Flight Master<br /><br />-When you have the hat, it is possible to equip it and then equip your normal helm, heres the trick though...<br /> ---You cannot have the hat in your main backpack<br /> ---You must right-click a helm to cover it up<br /> ---You cannot move the hat in your inventory once you have switched it, that will remove your parrot<br /> ---You must have the helm invisible, it dosn't work with it visible apparently<br /><br />Thats most of the information I was looking for before I started going for this, hope it helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>*There are 2 ways to grind rep:<br />1) Kill Blackwater Deckhands from Faldir's Cove, Arathi Highlands, from mid 30s to mid 40s<br />2) Kill Booty Bay Bruisers at level 60<br />(I preferred to do the deckhands because it was in an isolated area and they give XP and loot as well as the rep)<br /><br />* You need friendly reputation before the quest will become available to you. <br /><br />*You can do the quest for the hat at level 55. See Fleet Master Firallon in one of the Bloodsail ships offshore. He's not hard to find.<br /><br />* The quest itself requires you to kill Baron Revilgaz and Fleetmaster Seahorn in Booty Bay. Main problem is that the bruisers now shoot you on sight. You'll die a lot trying to get to them. <br />I found that if you resurrect on top of the goblin bank they are generally out of range. If you dispatch the goblin next to the Horde Windrider then you get a clear shot at the 2 and they go down rather easily. If you bring friends to help you, make sure they know about the massive reputation hit they are going to take.<br /><br />*Regaining your Steamwheedle Cartel reputation is a very difficult task. Blizzard is supposedly adding in quests for &quot;pirates&quot; in patch 1.11 to allow you to regain your reputation with the goblins but we shall see.<br /><br />*Problems with having hated reputation with all Goblinkind includes:<br />-Not being able to access the auction house, bank or mailbox in any goblin town. <br />-The Goblin quest givers in the Burning Steppes will attack you, removes a rather long quest chain that goes from UBRS and into Scholomance. You will not be able to talk to almost any other goblin quest givers or vendors from Ratchet to Razorfen Kraul up to Ungoro Crater, Silithus and even the non-goblin quest starter for &quot;You are Rakhelik, Demon&quot; (Alliance side only).<br />The only exception I have seen is Bijou, for Bijou's belongings, in LBRS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Final answer: NO, you cant get the hat as lvl 19.<br /><br />We have just finished the test on EU realm Stormscale. Getting to friendly means exactly 382 BB goblin kills. Thats not easy as goblins keep netting, resist FD and gunshot knockback sends you flying all over the town. The mobs give no exp and drop nothing.<br />We found out that reputation can be easily gained by standing as ghost near the killer. The leacher doesnt lose BB reputation either unless he agroes goblins or attacks them. Both factions friendly is possible in this manner.<br />Cloth turn-in quests become available at Unfriendly, but normal restrictions apply so you all you can turn in as lvl 19 is Linen (Ratchet).<br /><br />At 19 neither quest is available, for pirate outfit and for the hat. All the mentioned requierements were met, as we got Friendly with Bloodsail and Hated with BB.<br />Note that whole process of getting Bloodsail rep is extreme fun, people keep asking questions, RP discussions arise, etc.<br /><br />Whole test can be seen here, on our LLD forum (in Russian, but its full of screenshots, so you will get the idea)<br /><a href="http://forum.akara.ru/index.php?showtopic=4789" rel="nofollow">http://forum.akara.ru/index.php?showtopic=4789</a><br /><br />Guys and girls who spent hours of their precious time helping with the test:<br /><br />- Yuri - NE hunter OXOTA (Antagonist)<br />- Sergey - Human priest Zasada (Wintorez)<br />- Svetlana - NE rogue Demka (Demka)<br /><br />EU PvP Stormscale<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 24th 2006 4:37pm by wowfinish</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just tested this out with my 60 rogue who is Friendly with Booty Bay. I wanted to see how much rep loss with Booty Bay there is if you get someone to help you. I think at level 60, the quest should be relatively soloable (with difficulty maybe) but if you do get a healer friend or someone to help, here's what they can expect:<br /><br />Fleet Master Seahorn (pirate cow) kill = 75 rep loss with booty bay<br />Baron Revilgaz (goblin swashbuckler) kill = 375 rep loss with booty bay<br /><br />Not too bad if you've done a handful of quests in booty bay already. Nothing that's going to get you 'hated' with them or anything.<br /><br />When I thought the baron and fleet master were elite (don't know what gave me that idea) I was tentatively asking around to see if any wanted to help me, and the biggest response I got was &quot;how badly will it hurt my booty bay rep&quot; so I thought I'd find out.<br /><br />Also, because I like to be considerate of other players and these are NPCs that you turn quests in to sometimes, I checked out the respawn times before I left town.<br /><br />The cow respawned in about 8 minutes and the baron respawned in about 3 minutes. So if people @#$%^ at you for killing their NPCs, let them know that it shouldn't last more than 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />And a big dorky shout-out to the undead rogue on Bloodhoof who warned me &quot;I'm keeping an eye on you&quot; when he saw me kill the guys and didn't seem happy with my explaination that it was for a quest. I'm looking forward to the GM's telling him that it's all part of the game and that he should spend more time in the Barrens where he'll be around similarly small brained individuals :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, I have gotten many requests about this, being one of the few, so here is how you become a Bloodsail Admiral, and all the insane cons of doing so...<br />First you have to get a friendly reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.<br />This is a lot more involved than you might think...In order to increase your reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, you will have to kill NPC's in Booty Bay!<br />If you are willing to do that, the average lvl 60 that has done Booty Bay quests is about 13k-16k of 36k HATED with the Bloodsail Buccaneers when they start. <br />If you kill Booty Bay Bruisers or Elites, which give the highest rep per kill (25) this means that you will have to kill 1220 Booty Bay Bruisers or Elites just to get to friendly if you started at 14,500/36,000 Hated.<br />at the rate of 30 an hour, it would take you over 40 hours and 40 minutes in order to farm the rep you need to get to friendly status with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.<br />This is obviously a HUGE sacrifice as you will end up being Hated by all 4 goblin cities, as well as the Steamwheedle cartel, who have NPC's and guards loyal to them in many places.<br />Until you repair your reputation with the Steamwheedle Cartel, Booty Bay, Ratchet, Gadgetzan, and Everlook, you will not be able to go into those towns and conduct any business.<br />You will be attacked on site by any/all guards in these towns, and going into a building in any of those 4 towns will also make guards spawn continuously.<br />Being hated with these towns means that you will not be able to get or complete quests that start, end, or involve a npc in one of these towns. Some of these quests include the following.<br />- Unable to obtain any other parts of the Tier 0.5 gear than the bracers, as the next part in the chain requires you to speak to a member of the Cartel.<br />- Cannot fly into or out of Booty Bay, Un'Goro Crater, Gadgetzan, or Flame Crest safely, as both the Flight Path Masters are guaded by at least one Bruiser, and will attack you as they are loyal to Steamwheedle.<br />- Unable to use the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay Safely.<br />- You will be cut off to certain quests in high level dungeons such as the \&quot;Dawn's Gambit&quot; quest in Scholomance.<br />- Unable to get the Shadowforge key, as the quest chain to get the key to Scholomance involves going to Gadgetzan and forming the shaft of the key.<br />- Cannot go past 225 in Blacksmithing as the quest chains to become an Armorsmith or a Weaponsmith both require you to speak to member of the Cartel.<br />- Cannot go past 225 in Engineering as the only person who can train you is of Gadgetzan faction. <br />- Horde players will also be unable to become Goblin and Gnomish engineers, and Alliance players will be unable to become Goblin engineers.<br />- Unable to participate in the weekly fishing contest as you will not be able to turn in the tastyfish to win the competion, get money for the extra fish, or turn in any of the rare fish.<br />- The Burning Crusades expansion is going to be adding more quests that involve Gadgetzan and/or the Steamwheedle Cartel, and that means that you will not be able to do them if you are not at least neutral.<br />If you're willing to destroy your reputation with the goblin cities just to get a hat and the Blood Parrot, and also willing to sacrifice the time to repair your rep, Then you need to know how to get the quest...<br />Once you Finally get to Friendly status with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, you need to go south of Booty bay to the middle of the three Pirate ships there and talk with Fleet Master Firallon.<br />He will then give you the quest Avast, me harties!<br />This quest sends you into the heart of booty bay. At the top of the Inn building, you will have to kill Baron Revilgaz, and Fleet Master Seahorn, which will obviously spawn guards as soon as you attack them.<br />The reward for this quest is the Bloodsail Admiral's Hat, which you can use to summon your Blood Parrot.<br />If you get too far away from a bruiser, they will stop running after you and pull out their guns, and that means game over. They will not put away their guns once they pull them out for at least 5 minutes.<br />The problem with their guns is that they knockback like an ogre hammer. And they will keep firing, which can and will make you go from one side of the town or area to the other.<br />This makes killing the bruisers or the leaders next to impossible, so you have to do this all without getting far enough away the bruisers break out their guns instead of running after you!<br />It is not a mission to be taken lightly, as you must destroy your reputation which will take many hours to do so, and countless more to restore your reputation...<br />Realistically it will take at least a week or two to farm the reputation to do the quest, and at least a month or so to recover your reputation with the goblin cities afterward so that you can quest, help guildes...<br />and go around the world of azeroth without getting attacked, caught in nets, and killed.<br />Lastly I should mention the fact that you will spend much gold on the bandages and healing potions needed while farming the reputation to get the quest, and repariing your reputation after.<br />There are several ways to get your reputation with Booty Bay and the goblin cities back, but there is only one that I know of and have found that will level your rep with them without affecting your Bloodsail rep. This is the Shrik Ze Giants quest in Feralas given by the goblin on the west coastline of Feralas.<br />I personally spent over 300 gold on bandages, mats for bandages, healing potions, and equipment repairs just getting to the quest, and at least twice as much getting my reputation back to neutral afterwards with the goblins.<br />Unless you are lvl 60, very bored, have nothing better to do with a month or two of your time, and tons of gold, and dont care about not being able to travel to help friends/guildies then its really not worth doing.<br />End of tutorial.<br />Seravais Lvl 60 Undead Rogue US - Medivh - Horde<br /><a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?1179058">Seravais' Inventory, and equiped gear at last logout (usually my pirate outfit, Fire Resist gear, or normal garb)</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I decided to go for it with my 57 hunter since I'm kind of bored with him anyhow... &quot;Bruiser&quot; is no joke. I have a dog with 3k HP and 41% damage reduction, nearly dies every fight. Plus you only get 25 bloodsail rep for each of them, for me that means it'll take 1000 bruisers just to get to hostile!<br /><br />EDIT: After fighting some more they seem to have a crit rate upwards of 30%<br /><br />Edited, Tue Mar 29 15:49:11 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>360 Bruisers to go from hated to Friendly fyi</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I started at 0/36000 hated with the bloodsail buccaneers. So in 4.5 days total, I killed over 1800 booty bay guards. It didnt take as long as I thought it would because I also had help on my 2nd day of farming. I met a random level 60 tauren druid which later became a friend. It took me about 4.5 days to farm enough faction to get the quest. <br />If you have a job and not very much time then its probably gonna take you at least 2 weeks if you start at my level. Due to me currently being without a job, hehe it didnt take me nearly that long. I spent about 3 days just to farm enough cloth to get my faction back. I am now Honored with Ratchet, friendly with Gadgetzan, Neutral with Everlook, and Almost honored with booty bay.<br />I highly recommend farming for or buying linen from the Auction House and then doing the linen turn in quest at ratchet until you are no longer allowed to do the quest, then Silk with booty bay, Mageweave with gadgetzan and Runecloth with Everlook. Doing it in this order is cheaper and less time consuming on farming for the materials.<br />Not many people have this hat, so its worth it just to be unique or if you just want to be a true pirate.<br /><br />Ragefire Chasm / The Deadmines = Linen<br />Scarlet Monastery = Silk<br />Netherguarde mines = Mageweave<br />Runecloth = Deadwind pass<br /><br />Noyjitat 60 Undead Rogue - Lightbringer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">So for the most part, if you see someone wearing this hat, its the equivalent of carrying around a big sign that says &quot;Kill me I'm allergic to I.Q.&quot; </div> <br /><br />Not exactly, from the reasons posted not to get the hat, they aren't all that bad. I am a rogue, therefore I can stealth on the boats, no problem. Flying to Gad. is a pain... But evasion, sprint, and a vanish to break a net and I'm okay.<br /><br />For most classes, I've heard the Tier 0.5 is a waste of time and money. For the rogues it definatly is, the rogues that I know who have done it even say so. I suppose it isn't too bad if you aren't in a guild you'd actually get tier 1, but in that case, you have a whole different problem. You could at least go for PvP gear instead of the upgrades. In my oppinion, seeing someone walk around in tier 0.5 would make me worry about their I.Q. more than if they had the hat. But I don't really think getting tier 0.5 and the hat are a matter of I.Q., more of oppinion I would suppose.<br /><br />Blacksmithing, do it on a different char, though I admit that it is good to know that you need Steamweedle to go past 225 for anyone who is thinking about going for the hat.<br /><br />Finally, there are ways to get your rep back up with Steamweedle, just because someone has the hat doesn't mean they are still hated. There are goblins outside each city where you can turn in cloth for rep, also there are mobs you can grind... A pain, but if you want that hat, and still be able to get Noggenfogger, it's worth it.<br /><br />For someone who has the hat, the only drawback for me is not getting Noggenfogger, luckly I enjoy it on my alts. :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>certain mobs in booty bay you can kill, will ONLY lower booty bay faction, but still gain bloodsail faction. if you work those you shouldn't have a problem with the other goblins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is there anything neat at honored or revered with bloodsails? Cause once I get this hat I'll probably turn around and own pirates to get back to neutral with bb. Thank god they're much easier to kill than those danged bruisers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Grats on not being able to use any flight paths in Goblin towns. Idiots.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I know the hat itself doesn't have a level requirement, but what about the quest? In other words, even though it would be impossible to get the kills, would you, in theory, be able to get this hat at say... level 19?<br /><br />Edited, Mon Apr 17 03:22:30 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Right now on my server there are only 5 of us on the Horde side that have this item that I am aware of, and 2 on the alliance side.<br />I am constantly getting questions and reactions to having this hat, especially when participating in the weekly fishing contest.<br />So I am going to post as thorough tutorial of how to become a Bloodsail Admiral here, and all the Insane cons of doing so.<br />Ok, I have gotten many requests about this, being one of the few, so here is how you become a Bloodsail Admiral...<br />First you have to get a friendly reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.<br />This is a lot more involved than you might think...In order to increase your reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, you will have to kill NPC's in Booty Bay!<br />If you are willing to do that, the average lvl 60 that has done Booty Bay quests is about 13k-16k of 36k HATED with the Bloodsail Buccaneers when they start. <br />If you kill Booty Bay Bruisers or Elites, which give the highest rep per kill (25) this means that you will have to kill 1220 Booty Bay Bruisers or Elites just to get to friendly if you started at 14,500/36,000 Hated.<br />at the rate of 30 an hour, it would take you over 40 hours and 40 minutes in order to farm the rep you need to get to friendly status with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.<br />This is obviously a HUGE sacrifice as you will end up being Hated by all 4 goblin cities, as well as the Steamwheedle cartel, who have NPC's and guards loyal to them in many places.<br />Until you repair your reputation with the Steamwheedle Cartel, Booty Bay, Ratchet, Gadgetzan, and Everlook, you will not be able to go into those towns and conduct any business.<br />You will be attacked on site by any/all guards in these towns, and going into a building in any of those 4 towns will also make guards spawn continuously.<br />Being hated with these towns means that you will not be able to get or complete quests that start, end, or involve a npc in one of these towns.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>why ruin rep when you can tailor an Admiral's Hat with a stamina buff for you and your party? For what, a bird? Bahh<br /><br />Edited, Mon Nov 7 18:13:47 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It took me 4 days and about 25 hours of grinding goblins. The hat and the suit are awesome.<br />I have started the quests in feralas. They may have upped the rep. I am getting 25 for each city<br />for both the giants and the water cores. I want to keep my bloodsail reputation at the same time<br />as earning back the goblin rep. That is going to take sometime, but oh well.<br /><br />To the follow the crowd idiot that said something about &quot;IQ&quot; - The sign you can put around my<br />neck while I stand in IF in my garb with my bird &quot;I did something different in a game where everybody<br />does the same thing, wears the same thing, and therefore look the same&quot;.<br /><br />The best part of doing this quest was killing everything in Booty Bay. I paired up with a Pally ( I'm a druid - Balance), and we cut our way through town to get to The Baron and Seahorn. Killed every vendor, quest giver, innkeeper, etc on the way. Killed the 2 targets and jumped off the end of the balcony into the bay and swam for our lives.<br /> Some people cheered, some where like WTF? What a blast that was. So If you are concerned about your IQ - keep doing the same grind everybody else does. The fact that your IQ is probably lower than your toon's level won't display as brightly as posting crap here does.</div>
