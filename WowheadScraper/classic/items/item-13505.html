[b]New Final Edit[\/b]: This stacks starting in 6.0.2, and the speed bonus was increased to 10%.\n\nAlso if anybody was wondering, the equip passive of Unholy Aura gives 20 health every 5 seconds.\n\nIf you manage to obtain this weapon, consider yourself very lucky. Let me explain why.\n\nThis is a snippet from the 1.10 Patch notes:\n\n\"... In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased.\"\n\nThe items buffed were from the following list:\n\nDragon's Call\nCircle of Flame\nIronfoe\nAlanna's Embrace (Which possibly did not exist pre-1.10)\nHeadmaster's Charge\nRuneblade of Baron Rivendare\nBook of the Dead\nFelstriker\nBlackblade of Shahram\n\n\nWowhead did not exist before 1.10, so numbers had to be gathered from Thottbot and Allakazham. Before 1.10, every item on this list was close to a .1% drop rate. Both websites wiped all collection data clean for these dungeons due to the severe change to the loot. All numbers given (and drop percentages) come from  post-1.10 (which is how Wowhead always has been). Since 1.10, every item on this list went from a .1% drop rate to ~1.2-1.5%. This is true for every item listed here, except for the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare. Although it was specifically listed within the patch notes, its drop rate was never changed.\n\nSo again, consider yourself lucky if you obtain this item.\n\n[b]Final Edit[\/b]: Hello patch 4.0.3a! It looks like with Aurius replacing Baron Rivendare, Blizzard finally got around to buffing the drop rate of the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare. Though we only have a fairly small sample size right now (719 kills), it has dropped 13 times, meaning it's close to a 2% drop rate!\n\nSo this awesome weapon is finally not so amazingly rare. It just took all the patches in between 1.10->4.0.3a in order for Blizzard to fix it. :P\n\nHappy hunting!","date":"2006-10-30T20:32:39-06:00","rating":198,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"lastEdit":["2014-10-25T08:32:22-05:00",6,"Magmy"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":1,"id":5232,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"5315","body":"Very good for Paladin or Warrior, but i saw Hunter with this Imba Weapon :(","date":"2006-11-30T12:45:54-06:00","rating":-3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Seems to me it could be quite appropriate for a hunter, especially for pvp.

Thats like me saying a warrior should get just as much oppertunity on a bow or gun that a hunter does, or a mail piece, and whenever mail drops that a warrior wants and a hunter's in the group, they're very mad when you roll. Anyways, point is, if a warrior needs this, give it to him (or other melee weapon user, ie. paladin) over a hunter.

Of course the increased HP regeneration rate has no effect in battle, or pvp period, the increased movement speed is very good. Especially for a Paladin. Warriors have charge and hamstring, and maybe even improved hamstring, but Paladins do not have any slowing effect, and barely any ranged. Therefore, they need speed to pvp. This would help Paladin's in a great extent, in my own opinion of course. \n\nHunters also benefit from this, but to a lesser extent. It just helps them kite more easily.\n\nFor Warriors, they would benefit from the dps, and the HP regeneration. After a fight, if they have run out of bandages and food, they can just sit down, and let the sword bring Warriors back to fighting strength. The speed increase would just give them more time to charge if the opponent is faster or on a mount.","date":"2006-07-25T01:51:17-05:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Zhyn","importedSubject":"My 2 cents"},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":2696879,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I think the aura (unholy aura) gives [b]20hp every 5 sec[\/b] and [b]+8% movement speed[\/b] ;]","date":"2006-10-06T01:51:17-05:00","rating":21,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Shawnthor","importedSubject":"Speedz"},{"commentv2":1,"number":11,"id":3047504,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I was in the bank at IF the other day and 2 guys in there had this sword on....\n\nJust killed him for the first time and he dropped two blues.  40 dps dagger and set pants for rogue.","date":"2005-02-07T18:03:57-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"DolganHammerfell","importedSubject":"Barons Epic"},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"id":3047505,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"[b]I ninjaed this about 2 months ago when it dropped on my very first Rivendare run ever! \n\nhttp:\/\/www.darkwolves.biz\/screenshots\/xxrivendaresword.JPG \n\n60 NE Hunter, Arthas \n\nI think it is still the only one on the server! \nAnd yes I can still get instance groups.... \n\nFeel free to stop by and discuss at http:\/\/www.darkwolves.biz\/forum [\/b]","date":"2005-03-11T03:16:55-06:00","rating":-15,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"DarkWalkerDW","importedSubject":"HAHA suckers!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":3047506,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Denreth,\n\nIF that is the case then the lvl 60's that were at the Baron had no clue.

Paladins, because they have typically NO snares, so they have to stay in melee range with whoever they're fighting\/chasing.\n\nHunters, have to stay 8 yards away from opponents to deal their maximum damage, and the bonus movement speed would help GREATLY in acomplishing this goal.\n\nMy 2 cents\n\nEdited, Wed Aug 17 03:38:27 2005","date":"2005-08-12T09:16:58-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"mmmmmmmBacon","importedSubject":"Vin Diesel"},{"commentv2":1,"number":101,"id":3047595,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"this is @#$% for ms specc'd warriors \\o\/","date":"2006-01-04T08:24:38-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Bohlin","importedSubject":"!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":102,"id":3047596,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"This looks almost EXACTLY like frostmourne...

No movement speed increases stack, and this gives the 8% just like any other increase. <b>New Final Edit</b>: This stacks starting in 6.0.2, and the speed bonus was increased to 10%.<br /><br />Also if anybody was wondering, the equip passive of Unholy Aura gives 20 health every 5 seconds.<br /><br />If you manage to obtain this weapon, consider yourself very lucky. Let me explain why.<br /><br />This is a snippet from the 1.10 Patch notes:<br /><br />&quot;... In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased.&quot;<br /><br />The items buffed were from the following list:<br /><br />Dragon's Call<br />Circle of Flame<br />Ironfoe<br />Alanna's Embrace (Which possibly did not exist pre-1.10)<br />Headmaster's Charge<br />Runeblade of Baron Rivendare<br />Book of the Dead<br />Felstriker<br />Blackblade of Shahram<br /><br />Wowhead did not exist before 1.10, so numbers had to be gathered from Thottbot and Allakazham. Before 1.10, every item on this list was close to a .1% drop rate. Both websites wiped all collection data clean for these dungeons due to the severe change to the loot. All numbers given (and drop percentages) come from post-1.10 (which is how Wowhead always has been). Since 1.10, every item on this list went from a .1% drop rate to ~1.2-1.5%. This is true for every item listed here, except for the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare. Although it was specifically listed within the patch notes, its drop rate was never changed.<br /><br />So again, consider yourself lucky if you obtain this item.<br /><br /><b>Final Edit</b>: Hello patch 4.0.3a! It looks like with Aurius replacing Baron Rivendare, Blizzard finally got around to buffing the drop rate of the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare. Though we only have a fairly small sample size right now (719 kills), it has dropped 13 times, meaning it's close to a 2% drop rate!<br /><br />So this awesome weapon is finally not so amazingly rare. It just took all the patches in between 1.10-&gt;4.0.3a in order for Blizzard to fix it. :P<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheRaven</b></h3>This is much more warrior enclined. Its nice for hunters sure. But hp regen is much much more vital for a warrior then it is any other class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well for a hunter this is really just a stat bonus, of course their main dps comes from a bow, I've never really understood why people say hunter should get equal oppertunity on some things like this as a warrior. Warriors dps is ALL from their melee weapons obviously, it seems a no brainer that they should get this. Thats like me saying a warrior should get just as much oppertunity on a bow or gun that a hunter does, or a mail piece, and whenever mail drops that a warrior wants and a hunter's in the group, they're very mad when you roll. Anyways, point is, if a warrior needs this, give it to him (or other melee weapon user, ie. paladin) over a hunter. Though admittedly, it has good stats for any class, and I wouldn't be THAT upset if I lost it to a hunter, it just makes more sense for a warrior/paladin.<br /><br />This was buffed recently, making it slower and more max damage, this just seems to prove it's made for warriors, as speed hardly matters on hunter's melee weapon (in fact they usually prefer faster, case in point: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=35900">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=35900</a> ) Make a warriors day and don't roll on this, hunters. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey Airrow.....clearly you haven't played a warrior and have not learned that a warrior is a gear dependent class that relies on MELEE WEAPONS to do their damage, while hunters, on the other hand, usually use their ranged weapons.....<br /><br />If you think this weapon is 1 big toy then you should reroll and get a warrior so that you can at least get one..... <br /><br />A warrior should be the only one who should 'need' this because he requires the DPS and the DMG.....<br /><br />hunters on the other hand would only 'need' this if it had STATS on it.....<br /><br />got it? so i don't want to hear you saying that this is a TOY because you sound like a complete noob.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Simply put: any hunter needing on weapons that have no +AP, +crit, or + agility is a hunter who hasn't got a clue about how this game in general, or how their class in particular, works. Period.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this isnt a mage sword, or a hunter sword.<br />Mages DONT MELEE. HUNTERS Rarely Melee. A warrior would put good use to this, or even a paladin. case closed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I believe that the aspect of this sword is not on the dps, but on the effect. Of course the increased HP regeneration rate has no effect in battle, or pvp period, the increased movement speed is very good. Especially for a Paladin. Warriors have charge and hamstring, and maybe even improved hamstring, but Paladins do not have any slowing effect, and barely any ranged. Therefore, they need speed to pvp. This would help Paladin's in a great extent, in my own opinion of course. <br /><br />Hunters also benefit from this, but to a lesser extent. It just helps them kite more easily.<br /><br />For Warriors, they would benefit from the dps, and the HP regeneration. After a fight, if they have run out of bandages and food, they can just sit down, and let the sword bring Warriors back to fighting strength. The speed increase would just give them more time to charge if the opponent is faster or on a mount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With the more recent nerfs Blizzard has come out with regarding Dmg calculations this is a more desired weapon for MS spec'd warrior without there AR. For abilities such as MS, Overpower, wirlwind and execute the calulating number is not the 2.8 but 3.2 yay. This equals more damage output. Ofcourse AR is far superior to all two handed weapons except Spinal Reaver ---&gt; <a href="/classic/item=17104/spinal-reaper">Spinal Reaper</a> . Any warrior who own's either of these two axes should be smacked relentlessly for a year by every one on the server if they roll need on this though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, I can see how this is a hunter sword, and I would certainly let those hunters in my group roll on it, God knows that's generous considering the amount of hunters on my server, lol.

I play a human warrior, if this dropped, I wouldnt roll on it if the paladin in the group needed. Why? Because I got an arcanite reaper, and Im MS specced. Arc. reaper /MS &gt; Runeblade when it comes to dealing damage, simply because you get 5% higher critchance.<br /><br />However, if for some reason the paladin wasnt there or didnt need it, I would roll, because it would be a waste on a hunter. Higher movement rate? please. Walking around with an epic sword? Im sure youd love it if a warrior rolled on your hurricane, DHC or MC guns. <br /><br />Grow up?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have done some look up on this item and this is what i have found.<br /><br />The run speed buff is about 2% <br /><br />The drop rate is .01% or lower<br /><br />Now if you are a hunter and the only reson you want this blade is for the run speed then it is a waist, this blade is good for almost any class that can use but hunters(not too good for PVP warriors ether).<br /><br />The reson hunters have their mele spot is to give them buffs a good hunter should know how to stay out of mele range not be fighting mele no mater the dps of his wep.<br /><br />If hunters want to kite better then a speed pot is much beter then a dinky 2% speed buf from a sword.<br /><br />Really this wep is not to good in general no buffs (which is what hunters want, buffs for their range attack not a good mele wep) Bad use efect and low top damage if you are a hunter and you would rather have this then 2x bone hatchets then they need to go play in the freeway, or swich to my server so i can show them why its bad to be mele and a hunter(I will camp them till their familys starve). <br /><br /> Any none pug thats not a regular in the special olipics would never give this to a hunter (due to in a instance it is usless for them) A pally would best benifit from this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>That's definitely not a hunter weapon, hunter's need big max dmg 2h weapon for raptor strike and stats like agi which they need as ranged too.. nothing like this sword. It's best for a paladin, they need that speed (only class who doesn't have a speed boost/ranged skill).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hey cmon, why r u telling for who this sword is better, have u seen it dropped during your run and u have decided who should get it by comparing for which class it is better. This is nonsence u r talking here. &quot;This sword should go to hunter, cause of kitting, to pally cause he needs speed boost or warrior maybe&quot; bla bla bla. I'd like to hear what will u be saying when u see it drop. All 3 will yell I WANT IT, unless they have smthg better. And for the replay that all warrior should have arcanite reaper, stfu, i dont have one and aint getting one, cause i dont like it. Big bad axe, that can be MADE. And i will be sooo cool having it like the rest all other players who can use it. First of all, see it drop and then decide who should take it. <br />Ah yes, did i mention i got this baby just last night. We were rogue, mage, priest, shaman and me. And with minor speed enchant u run faster than with this sword. But it has good attack and speed and looks so damn nasty cool. So i am the first on my server to get it (as far as i know) and thats Thunderhorn. Thx for your patiance :))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bah this is strictly Warrior/Hunter IMHO. Pallies can go play with their dollies.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have seen this sword in action, although it looks cool, it does not make you unbeatable.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So, is it confirmed what the bonus movespeed is on the sword itself, or if it is stackable with Minor Movement Speed? Also, does the regeneration work in combat as well?<br /><br />If this thing stacks with Minor Speed, it could EASILY be the best weapon for kiting.<br /><br />Warriors need to shut up. The sword is too fast for MS, and too slow for Fury. Most good warriors would look at this and go &quot;holy balls, rivendare dropped. pally and hunter day.&quot;<br /><br />Paladins and hunters imo, have the rights to this. Paladins, because they have typically NO snares, so they have to stay in melee range with whoever they're fighting/chasing.<br /><br />Hunters, have to stay 8 yards away from opponents to deal their maximum damage, and the bonus movement speed would help GREATLY in acomplishing this goal.<br /><br />My 2 cents<br /><br />Edited, Wed Aug 17 03:38:27 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BloodaxeIsANoob</b></h3><s>This sword buff snapshots your gear when you equip it. Allowing you to change your gear after you equip the sword.<br /><br />Why is this important?<br /><br />This sword's healing regen is a 1:1 ratio with + healing gear. <br /><br />If you are lucky enough to get this sword, buy a bunch of green +healing gear. Get as much healing as you can. Then equip the sword. Then equip your normal PvP/PvE gear. <br /><br />700+ healing a tick is easily possible. You don't hit hard as someone with a t2 weapon, but the regen and movement speed makes up for it.<br /><br />Kiting as a hunter with a constant heal + movement speed? Warrior with their own pocket healer?<br /><br />It makes this weapon a very good find, you just gotta get it to drop &gt;.&lt;</s><br /><br />They changed it in a hotfix.</div>
