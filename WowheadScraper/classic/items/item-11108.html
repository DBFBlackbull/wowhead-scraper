(omw there now.. long flight)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~INTERMISSION~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nsoo..what brings you all the way out here little lady?&nbsp; XD&nbsp; I'm just a bored lev 70 that happen to see the photo on AH dirt cheap and it was white so I got curious.&nbsp; I love these offten missed quests.&nbsp; If you like these sorts of quests there is another one I can't remember the name..but it's a 'riddle' started by a scroll off one of the ships in STV.&nbsp; (the ones where you have to kill the captains) Takes you to a few different places and you end up with a cool 14slot 'explorers napsack'.&nbsp; Easily replaced now, but it's a TON TON TON of XP!&nbsp; I think you have to be 38?..or maybe it was 48 to start it though.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~Resuming Post~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[b]5)[\/b] Donova Snowden is at 31,45 in Winterspring which is on the very west end of the zone south of the road near a very small lake.&nbsp; If you read the bottom of the screen she says to follow her (she runs fast) to the little lake and throws the sword into it (given in previous quest). She explains how the lake improves whatever she throws into it.&nbsp; When she's done she just goes back to the tent.&nbsp; I had to click on her to see the next part which is titled \"The Videre Elixir\"\n\n[b]6)[\/b] Now you have to find 'Gregan Brewspewer' in Northern Feralis.&nbsp; Headed there now brb with cords.&nbsp; Flying to Feathermoon.. figured it's easier than the Thousand Needles FP.&nbsp; Ok..he's at 45,25 which is EXACTLY on the letter 'T' in the word 'THE' in 'The Twin Colossals'\n\n[b]7[\/b]&nbsp; Gregan does NOT have a gold dot.&nbsp; You just have to talk to him to get the next part.&nbsp; He goes on about how this root you need for the elixir is hard to find but that he does know of one but it's guarded.&nbsp; You then have to BUY (20s) bait to set down next to the thing guarding it.&nbsp; you have to go farther North of Gregan I guess to find the ruins where this thing is.&nbsp; Ok..it's a Gnoll at 44,10 just to the left of the road if you keep going north of the Colossals.&nbsp; You will see a square ruined building.&nbsp; The gnoll is on the steps.&nbsp; Ok..just click on the bait and you can place it anywhere near the stairs and he'll go to it revealing an open door to the root.&nbsp; No fighting necessary :D\n\n[b]8[\/b]&nbsp; So the point of THAT PART was to get the elixir to give back to Donova who then says to meet her in the grave yard in Tanaris.&nbsp; OMW there now. (total you get 3 elixirs, 1 for donova, 1 to take at the grave, and 1 more I guess in case you screw up)\n\n[b]9[\/b] Drink one of the remaining 2 elixirs IN THE GRAVE and you die right away.&nbsp; DON'T REZ!\n\n(I accidently rez'd and then only had one left.&nbsp; I took it and went north and into the mtns only to figure out that I think I forgot to get the part from Donova... Read it..just didn't accept it :(&nbsp; So now im on my way back to Feralis to get more elixir (hoping I can) and then back to Donova.&nbsp; I'm sure this all isn't worth it but it's fun to say I did it.)&nbsp; Ok..I was able to get more elixir with the bait and the whole gnoll thing.&nbsp; Went back to Donova and that's exactly what happened.&nbsp; Read quest but forgot to GET it.&nbsp; OMW back to the dang grave :(\n\nOk.. drank the potion..'died' and headed north..there IS A GOLD DOT at 53,23 or there abouts.&nbsp; He walks around a tiny bit.\n\n[b]10[\/b] Ok..so you go rez back at the grave AFTER talking to the ghost guy (while you are a ghost too) and you look for the grave stone with the gear.&nbsp; (only one that looks different really)&nbsp; Click on it and it tells you to go back to the guy in Ungoro.&nbsp; Reward at this point for a lev 70 is over a GOLD ooooooo&nbsp; :P\n\n[b]11[\/b]&nbsp; GEEZ..he says to talk to the girl in the cave where all the crystals are there at Marshals Refuge.&nbsp; She does something then you have to talk to her again and then she sends you off to find some guy in Felwood!&nbsp; And all I was going to do today was farm a bit of thorium in the crator and clean house :(\n\n[b]12[\/b] The person you need in southern Felwood is at the Emerald Santuary 51,81. I now need to find silvery claws and an Iron tree heart from the creatures of Felwood.\n\n***I realy hoping someone out there even reads this.&nbsp; I put a lot of time into completeing this so far.***\n\n[b]13[\/b] Got the claws off bears and wolves (none off birds) right around the quest giver and so on.&nbsp; The iron tree heart I had to go to Iron Tree Woods and kill one of those walking trees.&nbsp; Got it on first kill.&nbsp; \n\n[b]14[\/b]&nbsp; Now I have to go back to Tanaris to 'lost rigger cove' and look for a circle of stones.&nbsp; (found at 70,49) Which is on the back side of the fenced area.. Go around to the south side of the fenced area and then back up into the mountains a bit and you will see some almost teeth shaped boulders sticking out of the sand.&nbsp; (not small rocks like I pictured)&nbsp; Click on the tome in your bag and a lev 54 water elemental comes at you.. just stay in the circle and it will show complete when he gets there.&nbsp; Then just kill him.\n\n[b]15[\/b]&nbsp; You then have to take the item you get from that completion back to the girl in the cave at Marshals Refuge and then she tells you to go to Linken just out side the cave.&nbsp; Then you have to go to Fire Plume Ridge [b]this part is a group quest[\/b] to the top and kill that elite nasty fire elemental in the cave.&nbsp; But you get something to remove some aura which..as far as I can tell it did nothing.&nbsp; I used the wand thing that is supose to 'dispell' his aura and that started combat.&nbsp; He beat me around over and over and over and I hardly ever got ONE shot off.. I was always flying in the air.&nbsp; Something went wrong for sure.\n\nOk.. used the wand thing again.. was buffed up and a bit more ready this time.&nbsp; Froze him in spot (mage) and then just used arcane misciles over and over and he went down no problem.&nbsp; DON'T FORGET to go IN THE CAVE to get the box with the flame thing or you will have to go back and kill the guy again to get it.&nbsp; (like I did)&nbsp; Take that back to Linken and you are ~~~FINALLY DONE!~~~\n\nGRATS..that was definitely the LONGEST QUEST EVER but I hope I helped SOMEONE\n\nP.S. Buying the picture is only worth a chuckle if you have no intention of doing this quest.&nbsp; You get one when you start the quest at the boat as I stated in step three.&nbsp; And you never have to turn it in so you can keep or sell when done with the quest.","date":"2007-05-09T17:16:24-05:00","rating":419,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Exactly the same in classic 22\/10\/2019","creationdate":"2019-10-22T09:40:27-05:00","id":1335301,"rating":14,"commentid":2627782,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"Frapkin","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"This is like reading an ancient journal!","creationdate":"2019-11-11T17:28:30-06:00","id":1338873,"rating":9,"commentid":2627782,"dataTree":4,"roles":16384,"username":"Nemetorwow","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Is this \"remove aura\" not working problem like the same problem you have with Morbent's Bane where half the time it literally goes off and does nothing?","creationdate":"2020-07-27T22:21:33-05:00","id":1381471,"rating":0,"commentid":2627782,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"musclemonkeh","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Wow.. that’s my post from Thottbot 15 years ago!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just additional fluff, you can get rid of it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it is link and princess zelda in front of the castle. the legend of zelda rocks and blizzard knows this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Faded Photo is found in a wrecked boat next to the water in the southeastern portion of the Crater.&nbsp; Opening the pack that you'll find nearby (under the water), you'll find several items.&nbsp; The Photo is one of them.<br /><br />The photo goes to the gnome in the Marshal's Camp in northern Un'Goro Crater and starts a quest that takes you to Winterspring.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The photo stays in your pack after you get a quest from Linken, an amnesiac gnome at Marshall's Refuge in Un'Goro Crater. The quest is called &quot;It's A Secret to Everybody&quot; and tells you to &quot;Take Linken's sword to Donova Snowden in Winterspring&quot;. The photo, however, stays in your pack but has no further use and can be destroyed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you dont start the quest by clicking on the item, you take the item and talk to linken in marshall's refuge.&nbsp; You just have to HAVE this item the first time you talk to him in order to get going.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i did all of linkens quests, after his final one where you kill lbaze runner he takes all of the items except the photo. im pretty sure its just another momento item blizzard added in, that or its bugged and he forgets to take it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it is a total reference to zelda always had ameisa at the beginning and had to alway powerup his sword too</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In the photo there are 2 people.&nbsp; (link and zelda)<br /><br />We all know where Link (Linken) is, but what happened to Zelda (?Zedlea?)?<br /><br />I just want to meet her in person.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Looks like Marshal's Refugee is full of references to other games. Have anyone noticed before that Larion and Muigin are straight from Super Mario. Blizzard has just switched M and L and added an extra N in the end of the word. Muigin is a long, green-clothed guy while Larion is short, red-clothed. Obvious!<br /><br />Found anything else?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well the best I can tell the picture is in the front of SW city so maybe the girl is there somewhere?&nbsp; maybe we get something cool for taking the pic back to her. LOL I'm thinking if that was the case it'd allready be on Thottbot as a quest but you never know lol<br /><br />Lords of Entropy ~Feathermoon~<br />Thormack</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>If you want to do this quest, THIS IS HOW YOU REALLY START IT</b><br /><br /><b>1)</b> Go to 63,68 in Ungoro Crator and click on the 'raft' that is wrecked on the shore of the small lake.&nbsp; (if you don't have cords it is in the SE section of the crator and it's the second lake from the south.. sort of Y shaped)<br /><br /><b>2)</b> That quest you get from clicking on the wrecked raft tells you to look in the lake.. only a couple feet away in the lake is a bag under the water.&nbsp; Click on it and it will give you a bag to examine and another quest to find the owner.&nbsp; He is at Marshals refuge.&nbsp; Cords are 44,8 but it's so far north it's hard to see.&nbsp; Just look for yellow dot on mini map.<br /><br /><b>3)</b> IN the bag are a few things including the photo.&nbsp; I think you have to open the bag of goodies 'examine' (right click) in order to get the yellow dot at the refuge though.<br /><br /><b>4)</b> Anyway, Linken (at the refuge and owner of the bag) then tells you to talk to Donnava Snowden in Winterspring. (omw there now.. long flight)<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~INTERMISSION~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />soo..what brings you all the way out here little lady?&nbsp; XD&nbsp; I'm just a bored lev 70 that happen to see the photo on AH dirt cheap and it was white so I got curious.&nbsp; I love these offten missed quests.&nbsp; If you like these sorts of quests there is another one I can't remember the name..but it's a 'riddle' started by a scroll off one of the ships in STV.&nbsp; (the ones where you have to kill the captains) Takes you to a few different places and you end up with a cool 14slot 'explorers napsack'.&nbsp; Easily replaced now, but it's a TON TON TON of XP!&nbsp; I think you have to be 38?..or maybe it was 48 to start it though.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~Resuming Post~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><b>5)</b> Donova Snowden is at 31,45 in Winterspring which is on the very west end of the zone south of the road near a very small lake.&nbsp; If you read the bottom of the screen she says to follow her (she runs fast) to the little lake and throws the sword into it (given in previous quest). She explains how the lake improves whatever she throws into it.&nbsp; When she's done she just goes back to the tent.&nbsp; I had to click on her to see the next part which is titled &quot;The Videre Elixir&quot;<br /><br /><b>6)</b> Now you have to find 'Gregan Brewspewer' in Northern Feralis.&nbsp; Headed there now brb with cords.&nbsp; Flying to Feathermoon.. figured it's easier than the Thousand Needles FP.&nbsp; Ok..he's at 45,25 which is EXACTLY on the letter 'T' in the word 'THE' in 'The Twin Colossals'<br /><br /><b>7</b>&nbsp; Gregan does NOT have a gold dot.&nbsp; You just have to talk to him to get the next part.&nbsp; He goes on about how this root you need for the elixir is hard to find but that he does know of one but it's guarded.&nbsp; You then have to BUY (20s) bait to set down next to the thing guarding it.&nbsp; you have to go farther North of Gregan I guess to find the ruins where this thing is.&nbsp; Ok..it's a Gnoll at 44,10 just to the left of the road if you keep going north of the Colossals.&nbsp; You will see a square ruined building.&nbsp; The gnoll is on the steps.&nbsp; Ok..just click on the bait and you can place it anywhere near the stairs and he'll go to it revealing an open door to the root.&nbsp; No fighting necessary :D<br /><br /><b>8</b>&nbsp; So the point of THAT PART was to get the elixir to give back to Donova who then says to meet her in the grave yard in Tanaris.&nbsp; OMW there now. (total you get 3 elixirs, 1 for donova, 1 to take at the grave, and 1 more I guess in case you screw up)<br /><br /><b>9</b> Drink one of the remaining 2 elixirs IN THE GRAVE and you die right away.&nbsp; DON'T REZ!<br /><br />(I accidently rez'd and then only had one left.&nbsp; I took it and went north and into the mtns only to figure out that I think I forgot to get the part from Donova... Read it..just didn't accept it :(&nbsp; So now im on my way back to Feralis to get more elixir (hoping I can) and then back to Donova.&nbsp; I'm sure this all isn't worth it but it's fun to say I did it.)&nbsp; Ok..I was able to get more elixir with the bait and the whole gnoll thing.&nbsp; Went back to Donova and that's exactly what happened.&nbsp; Read quest but forgot to GET it.&nbsp; OMW back to the dang grave :(<br /><br />Ok.. drank the potion..'died' and headed north..there IS A GOLD DOT at 53,23 or there abouts.&nbsp; He walks around a tiny bit.<br /><br /><b>10</b> Ok..so you go rez back at the grave AFTER talking to the ghost guy (while you are a ghost too) and you look for the grave stone with the gear.&nbsp; (only one that looks different really)&nbsp; Click on it and it tells you to go back to the guy in Ungoro.&nbsp; Reward at this point for a lev 70 is over a GOLD ooooooo&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><b>11</b>&nbsp; GEEZ..he says to talk to the girl in the cave where all the crystals are there at Marshals Refuge.&nbsp; She does something then you have to talk to her again and then she sends you off to find some guy in Felwood!&nbsp; And all I was going to do today was farm a bit of thorium in the crator and clean house :(<br /><br /><b>12</b> The person you need in southern Felwood is at the Emerald Santuary 51,81. I now need to find silvery claws and an Iron tree heart from the creatures of Felwood.<br /><br />***I realy hoping someone out there even reads this.&nbsp; I put a lot of time into completeing this so far.***<br /><br /><b>13</b> Got the claws off bears and wolves (none off birds) right around the quest giver and so on.&nbsp; The iron tree heart I had to go to Iron Tree Woods and kill one of those walking trees.&nbsp; Got it on first kill.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>14</b>&nbsp; Now I have to go back to Tanaris to 'lost rigger cove' and look for a circle of stones.&nbsp; (found at 70,49) Which is on the back side of the fenced area.. Go around to the south side of the fenced area and then back up into the mountains a bit and you will see some almost teeth shaped boulders sticking out of the sand.&nbsp; (not small rocks like I pictured)&nbsp; Click on the tome in your bag and a lev 54 water elemental comes at you.. just stay in the circle and it will show complete when he gets there.&nbsp; Then just kill him.<br /><br /><b>15</b>&nbsp; You then have to take the item you get from that completion back to the girl in the cave at Marshals Refuge and then she tells you to go to Linken just out side the cave.&nbsp; Then you have to go to Fire Plume Ridge <b>this part is a group quest</b> to the top and kill that elite nasty fire elemental in the cave.&nbsp; But you get something to remove some aura which..as far as I can tell it did nothing.&nbsp; I used the wand thing that is supose to 'dispell' his aura and that started combat.&nbsp; He beat me around over and over and over and I hardly ever got ONE shot off.. I was always flying in the air.&nbsp; Something went wrong for sure.<br /><br />Ok.. used the wand thing again.. was buffed up and a bit more ready this time.&nbsp; Froze him in spot (mage) and then just used arcane misciles over and over and he went down no problem.&nbsp; DON'T FORGET to go IN THE CAVE to get the box with the flame thing or you will have to go back and kill the guy again to get it.&nbsp; (like I did)&nbsp; Take that back to Linken and you are ~~~FINALLY DONE!~~~<br /><br />GRATS..that was definitely the LONGEST QUEST EVER but I hope I helped SOMEONE<br /><br />P.S. Buying the picture is only worth a chuckle if you have no intention of doing this quest.&nbsp; You get one when you start the quest at the boat as I stated in step three.&nbsp; And you never have to turn it in so you can keep or sell when done with the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The picture reminds me of the pictures you get while you go through Link's Awakening.
