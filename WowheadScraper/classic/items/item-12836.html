Nice, the guy attacked me, I wouldn't have even killed him if he hadn't. Sometimes ya just get lucky I guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is he a random spawn at the lumbermill, or does he wander throughout the mountains?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anybody have an answer to the question above, can't find this guy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know anything more about the randomness of his spawn, or can answer additional questions? Such as..<br /><br />How often does he spawn?<br /><br />Is he in the &quot;northridge lumbermill area&quot; in general (as supplied by the maps on wow.allakhazam and thottbot), or is he actually IN the lumbermill building itself with the 4 lumberjacks and the wandering Scarlet Knight?<br /><br />Does he have an independant spawn, or does he replace one of the mobs in this area? (a VERY important question for those who might seek to camp him)<br /><br />After 2 days of searching and grinding on scarlets from 57-60, I not only have yet to see him, I have yet to meet anyone who's ever seen him or has the plans. Nor have I seen them on the AH or has anyone responded to /1 and /2's in town. I really hope he's actually in live, since saving all the materials has hurt my bankroll quite a bit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I killed him a few days ago after checking this site and seeing where he was. I'm only at 281 in blacksmithing right now, but I'm already collecting the materials I'll need to build this thing. After I checked the site I went over to the lumber mill and he was there, standing in the outer part of it, with the logs. It doesn't look like he replaces a normal mob because I've been back there several times in hopes of getting another plan to sell on the AH, but I've never seen him, and theres never been a mob in the place he was standing. I play on Crushridge server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes,<br />This mob does exists and looted frostguard pattern from it.<br /><br />Chompstomp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>he was standing in the small camp to the SW ? of the lumber mill.. he was an approx lvl 55 silver elite.. had the plans on him, on the Illidan server... btw, ive hunted a lot around there for 2 weeks, never saw him before or since</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, as an update to my previous post, I finally found the elusive bastard while randomly running by the lumbermill. He was in the exact center of the camp to the west of the lumbermill building, where the dreamfoil sometimes appears. His model was the silver haired human male, with a rather large axe, easily distinguishable from the other lumberjacks, and when at about medium health, he'll summon all the other lumberjacks in range (about 9 at this location) to fight with him. Thank god for evasion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know the respawn rate.&nbsp; I was up there waiting for him for a good hour all of a sudden he spawns right in the camp.&nbsp; I start heading for him when a 60 rogue stealths in there and steals my guy right from me.&nbsp; I was so piss.&nbsp; So i figure well i will sit here and wait again.&nbsp; 3 hours go by and he didn't spawn.&nbsp; Just wondering if someone know a respawn rate on him?&nbsp; Or just an idea.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Made Frostguard on the Lothar Server<br /><br />Chompstomp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, so I spend 4 days 4-6hrs a day looking in the location posted for this dude.&nbsp; I decide it is broken and page a GM.&nbsp; He tells me that their is more than one location for this guys spawn...so where are the other locations?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Guys you are totally gonna hate me but I thank you for the great instructions.. I went to Lumber Mill..Killed 1 mob first try at this who spawns but our friend I smoked him and now I have plans..crazy huh...Suzy (blackhand) server now in service thanks guys .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the normal respwn time of a silver colored mob is 8h but it could be different on several mobs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got it once... I've never found him again... I put it up for a 30g bid and a 50g buyout and i swear to god it sold in like 2 minutes...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was checking for that chest that spawns near the barrel wagons (oddly good drops for a chest, gotten Mugthol's Helm and 2 Julie's Daggers out of it, on different occasions of course). Anyway, no chest, but the guy was standing there and he dropped this, recipe for Gift of Arthas, Swashbucklers Eyepatch of the Monkey and some mail shoulders.<br /><br />Died right as I killed him because he calls for help and the entire camp attacks. Worth it though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was just doing some quests in WPL and found the rare elite guy at the lumber mill.&nbsp; Killed him to see what he had, and was quite supprised when he dropped this.<br /><br />Its of no use to me, so if anyone wants to buy it message 'Pype' on Magtheradon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was killin to reach the lumber camp on a quest and i killed without seeing who he was looted got plans came here to c what it sells for so i guess its jus luck w/e im goin bak tho to hopefully get another one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>found the guy when i was lvl 52 just wandering around wpl looking fore mobs to grind...<br /><br />hes at the lumbercamp where those scarlet asholes &quot;live&quot;<br /><br />saw this fellow and decidet to make my day... he was easily pulled away from the group, but unfortunaly called for assistance when almost dead... well i feared the adds killed him(used a potion tho, 5 orange mobs hit hard) looted him fast and ran for it...&nbsp; got shreddet by some 59 guy walking around tho... <br /><br />trew them on AH for 35/40 sold in minutes...<br /><br />they go for way more now tho:(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>me, lvl 55 warrior, was just runing around looking for some small thorium veins. then i saw this guy. pulled him away and killed him with no problems at all! didnt know a lvl 59 rare spawn would be so easy. got the plans. cant wait to see how muc hi can sel this for. gonna get the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Lionheart%20Helm">Lionheart Helm</a> soon, so money is good to have then</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was picking the dreamfoil that spawns at 44,34 when he spawned right on top of me.&nbsp; I killed him easily looted immediately because he agroed 5 adds!&nbsp; I can't believe I lived through it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone on my server suggest I just vendor the recipe because the mats are so insane that nobody will buy it...<br /><br />As many times as I have picked that dreamfoil, I've never seen this guy until now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After spending many many hours out there farming gold/mats off the lumerjacks, waiting for him, I gave up &amp; did some pvp.<br />I go back out there a few days later and he's in the lumbermill, next to the log (I think the knight was next to him as well) + the 1 in front of the mill.<br /><br />Today I saw him in the camp/circle of lumberjacks/knights by the wagon - killed the 1 knight by the tree on the south side &amp; managed to pull the Foreman alone (but he does call for help when he gets low on hp).<br /><br />I don't think he spawns by killing the mobs in the area, but I also don't think it's on a set timer.<br /><br />The materials for this weapon are quite ridiculous, as others have noted.<br />Prices on materials seemed to have jumped up a bit since 2.0 since everyone can't disenchant all the useless BoP's they find unless they have the required Enchanting skill - that &amp; more people are going for the HWL gear instead of raiding &amp; having to roll on stuff.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>absolutely ridiculous. 200g worth of mats for a 40 dps one hand that gets replaced by 50 dps green 1hs in 2 levels. This might have been a decent weapon back in the day when the big guilds were still figuring out how to down the beast in ubrs and no one had even heard of molten core yet. I pity anyone who makes one of these now.</div>
