<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Try the Y in ABYSSAL SANDS on your map of Tanaris.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I concur with Scalp, the Fire Rocs in Tanaris have a drop rate for the eggs of 30%.<br /><br />They are at the &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;Abyssal Sands&quot; if you look on your map, or for you location fans, (45,39).<br /><br />There are about 10 Fire Rocs flying around a large skeleton ribcase on top of a dune.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The drop rates listed here are all screwed up.&nbsp; The drop rate from the Owlbeasts in Winterspring is much, much lower than 95%+.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just go east of Aerie Peak, maybe a little southeast, and there are TONS of owlbeasts that drop Giant Eggs.&nbsp; I am on Zul'Jin, so it may be different for other servers.&nbsp; If you get to the Altar of Zul you have gone too far.&nbsp; You want to be northwest of there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He's right!&nbsp; The Hinterlands are the place to be.&nbsp; I didn't get squat from the Rocs, but the Owlbeasts were laying eggs like crazy, lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>tloc 36,50 those owl lay egg</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me about an hour to get all 12 from the fire rocs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Getting the giant eggs from the rocs is quicker, plus while you're waiting for them to respawn you can kill the nearby hyenas for other recipe ingredients like red wolf meat, tender wolf meat, and mystery meat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Primitive Owlbeasts just north of The Altar of Zul in Hinterlands.<br />Took me about 20 mins to get the 12 eggs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I spent 5 minutes fighting the rocs in tanaris and I got 7 eggs in no time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where is the best place for the Horde to look for these, besides Tarnaris? I would go to Hinterlands, but there are a lot of Alliance there and I don't feel like corpse running the place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm at the Abyssal Sands site (at the ribcage), been killing Rocs like crazy and only got 1 egg so far. Maybe I should try Hinterlands.<br /><br />That's in the Gorefiend server, by the way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i remember it was hell to grind these for the artisan cooking quest, so instead of using them to make Monster Omelete, sell them on the AH. i made a bit of money doing this cuz there are some mobs that are higher lvl that drop the eggs with a much higher drop rate than the roc's that the questgiver tells you to farm for them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tried to kill some owls in Hitherland &lt;sp&gt;, but was barely putting a dent in them at 35. Since you can get the quest for cooking at 35 you would think some brain at Blizzard would have beasts you could kill with a decent drop rate for the eggs. The owls I encountered were 41 and up. I've killed other beasts that were 5-6 levels higher, but those owls must all be plds or something.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 15th 2007 8:14am by DonCorneo</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>True.<br /><br />Hunter loot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>for hunter</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jfoobar</b></h3>Got my 12 off of primitive owlbeasts in The Hinterlands (lvl 44-45), droprate was at least 1 in 3 and probably more like 40%. The wowhead map on where these mobs roam is spot on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Haeload</b></h3>Update for anybody reading the below super old comments:<br /><br />The Hinterlands have Primitive and Savage Owlbeasts that drop small eggs - NOT giant eggs. Not sure if this was changed in some patch but I killed every Owlbeast I could find and never once saw a giant egg.<br /><br />I've not checked Tanaris as I decided to just buy the mats on the AH.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Motowatch</b></h3>I just got about 70 of these from killing the Owlbeasts in southeastern Winterspring, where the caves are with the Rich Thorium Deposits, that same caves for that Elune escort quest. I was also getting 640-704 rested XP on my 58 Fire Mage, so I ground out the whole level to 59 in about 5 hours. They respawn SO fast! ^L^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jamdrizzle</b></h3>If, like me, you couldn't acquire any giant eggs and found yourself in tanaris with more than 6 eggs but think 'Meh, I'll just mount around tanaris and camp the Roc's for the remaining eggs' since you need 12 for the quest.<br /><br />Well, it's doable but a bit painful.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Astronian</b></h3>These are super expensive as of early SoD P3. Going for about 2g per egg on Wild Growth US. Most likely for the cooking quest.</div>
