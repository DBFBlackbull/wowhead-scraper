Personally, I loved it. The flamestrike is the most common proc. But the stat buffs STACK.<br /><br />If you have this, and windfury, you can gain 250 to all stats.<br /><br />And let me tell you - there is nothing quite like AOE stunning alliance in Alterac Valley.

The best pre-raid 2h hands down, especially for MS warriors. If you are a warrior/paladin and this drops, ROLL ON IT! As the above poster said, the proc is quite nice!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>20928</b></h3>The sword lacks stats, but it is a great sword to have fun with and it can ease up any 5/10-man run by a lot.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This dropped for me last night and the stats have been changed with 1.10. It's now far more suitable for MS Warriors. The DPS is still the same, but the max damage has been upped to 250 and the speed has been slowed to something like 3.70, going from memory.<br /><br />I'm a dual wielding Prot-ish Warrior, but I carry a 2 hander for Whirlwinds and stuff. The only others in our raid who could equip it were another full prot Warrior and a Hunter. Neither of them wanted it so I rolled need. It was a guild raid so no one had a problem with it, and it's a good upgrade from the Warblade of Caer Darrow or Barbarous Blade that I was previously using.<br /><br />EDIT: My bad, I see the change has already been discussed. Well at least I can confirm that it is changed on the live servers. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah i got the weapon, and its my first epic, i got it thanks to a Master looter. (since the ranged class erm... what are they called?... - oh yeah, the hunter, rolled need). I rolled highest vs another Warrior, as the hunter rolls were discarded.<br /><br />Dont have any thing against hunters that have the weapon, but clearly, its a melee classed weapon and ffs, hunters are RANGED!&nbsp; <br /><br />Would be fun to see a hunter go in melee bcos they have the weapon though XD LMAO<br /><br />Any ways, i must say it proccs a lot (hope they wont change it cos it pwns) and i get the +50 stat all the time, ive even got tripple buffed with +50 mana/health regen x2 and one +50 to all stats. (fighting in an instance vs a group of mobs ofc. but any way ;P).<br /><br />Dont need any hunters to reply to this, bcos come on guys, how happy would you be when a melee classed person rolled need on your epic bows / guns, with a reason like: &quot;Well they always tell me as a tank to pull and i need a fast bow / Or a rouge for making difficult pulls with stealth, i mean c'mon. (so dont get mad at me... &lt;3!)<br /><br />Btw grats to every one, the drop is freakin low :&gt;! Alliance ftw ;P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This was the most amazing UBRS run in my life.&nbsp; I'm a 60 Warrior, and my friend, a 60 Paladin, asked me if I wanted to go on a UBRS run with him.&nbsp; I was like, &quot;sure,&quot; and we ended up getting 8 more people very, very quickly, and we were a very balanced and pretty cooperative group.&nbsp; So we're dropping mobs on the balcony above the Rookery, and a Myrmidon's Signet drops.&nbsp; It was pretty sweet.&nbsp; We moved on, and while clearing the Chromatic dragonkin in Rend's room before the fight with him, a Krol Blade drops.&nbsp; The same person won the Krol Blade, but he ended up giving it to the second highest roller later on.&nbsp; So far, that's two epics!&nbsp; BoE epics!&nbsp; We're all like &quot;OMG&quot; and &quot;LOL,&quot; but it was awesome.&nbsp; So I'm hoping for the Breastplate of Valor to drop from Drakkisath, and he ends up dropping the Blackblade of Shahram, and, again, we were all shocked, because three epics in one run is, obviously, not that common to happen!&nbsp; So I rolled against three other players, and no one ninjaed, and I won.&nbsp; It was an awesome run.&nbsp; And to think, I probably would have been fighting in WSG or AB, trying to hit Rank 8...and I respecced to readjust my Arms talents, and I have yet to fight with this sword.&nbsp; It should be fun!&nbsp; I'll take the advice that I read here and have my friend slap a Fiery enchant on it for me. ^^<br /><br />- Riikku<br />60 Human Warrior<br />Azgalor (PvP)</div>

This sword MORE than deserves a Crusader enchant or a +25 agi enchant. Both would be very good, i chose Crusader tho cuz i like procs.

Honestly u roll on every &amp;*!@ing 2h wep u see and its always swords. Im not saying all hunters are like this this is for the few that keep rolling on weps like these and taking them from wars who need them more. How would you guys feel if a war rolled on an epic ranged wep?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this sword last night, it's a pretty nice sword for any DPS Warrior or Paladin, especially since the buffs can seriously help a group. As far as I've been told the AoE enemy stun can stun just about any boss in the entire game. I'd like somebody to confirm this if possible. The guy himself looks like a human sized Lucifron. I have no idea what the proc rate is for this sword but it does seem to proc a good bit. I figured out why this sword does what it does also. This spirit Shahram for whatever reason decided to move into this sword, and whenever you start banging him around inside there by attacking whatever he gets pissed off and jumps out from time to time to see what's going on. Rather than be pissed at you (which is a good thing because he'd probably totally whoops the crap out of you) he decides to help you get ride of whatever is messing with you so you won't have to bang his home around any more. Pretty cool arangement if you ask me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can anyone post a graphic of the sword or maybe put up a link to a graphic? Im assuming that it looks exactly like the one drakkisath uses though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just looted this with my Orc Warrior. I'm arms spec, and with the new stats this will be a fun sword to play around with. Taking into cross realm AVs will be fun for sure, or dpsing in MC or BWL. Anyways, this was the 3rd epic drop in the same UBRS run. First drop was the Cloudkeeper Legplates, then teh Pristine Hide off the beast, and finally this sword. I was upset about the legplates for the whole run, because they dropped off 1 of the very first mobs and everyone rolled because they are BoE. But looting this sword of Drakk made up for it in the end.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If this drops, give it to the warriors. Any weapon with such a grand proc must be had by our class. Such skills as retaliation, sweeping strikes, cleave, and mortal strike, we can proc this more than any other class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Warrior would probably be a good choice for a group that does MC and Onyxia a lot, but theres no reason a Pally cant have rights to this. With seal of crusader, you're lookin at about 1.4 speed for an off tank... not like damage is important for pallys anyway, might as well give them a reason to be up there swinging :-)<br /><br />Hunters: Don't even think about it. You're thinking about it right now, stop that!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I (horde 60 warrior with Reaper) see this as a paladin weapon pretty much. Paladins have the luxury of the best PvP survivability to do enough normal swings for this to proc (they rely a lot on SoC to proc anyway).<br /><br />This weapon is no good for overpower/mortal strike/etc. No good stats for hunters (+crit, +anything).<br /><br />I could maybe see this working for a fury warrior, but with the recent patch it's clear that fury warriors are meant to dual-wield.<br /><br />By the way, survival specced hunters still suck at melee. In melee, a survival specced hunter would still lose out to all other melee and hybrid melee classes; paladins, warriors, rogues, shamans, druids. At least at range, even survival specced, they would have a good shot at a few of those classes.</div>

Because most warriors have to whip out their shield and crappy 1handed mace in instances, even when they'd rather be wielding their arcanite reaper or whatever huge weapon they lay their hands on.<br /><br />Therefore, the party affecting proc of the sword, would be nice on a paladin, since he could be dealing some damage to the best of his capability, and dropping in some heals and blessings now and then.

Agility/stam/crit gear for marksmanship spec'd hunters... Strength/agility/crit gear for survival spec'd.... etc.. etc... anyone who has ever witnessed a survival spec'd hunter in action (one that knows what they are doing) can vouch for me, They rock! Tons of stun effects, WC,FD, freeze trap, etc.. Not a rogue in the WORLD that could beat a good survival spec'd... not any class, for that matter... I dueled a pally (a damn good one) for over 2 hours. It ended abruptly as the servers came down for scheduled maintenance, so we never got to see who won. Ranged hunters (marks spec'd) are a bit more useful for instances and actual PvP battles, whereas Survival is most useful for 1 on 1 encounters (such as hunter epic quest encounters) and duels.... blah blah blah<br /><br />---To deny your instincts is to deny that which makes you truly unique.---</div>

And now with 250 top end damage, it's a mortal strike viable weapon.<br /><br />Someone change my panties.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this dropped today in UBRS on frostmourne.<br /><br />this thing has insane procs. Some amazing things do happen, such as 1 +50 stats buff, and 2 aoe. The guy looks like ambassador in BRD.<br /><br />He also has a buff that gives 50 health/5sec and 50 mana/3sec for 20 secs. And the 5s stun and a 8sec speed boost thats a group boost.<br /><br />if counterweight increases the proc chance by 3%, then its probably the best enchant for it. Otherwise, Crusader/25agil</div>

BUT...it is TOO FAST. It would be so much better with like...a 3.00 speed (of course it would probably be overpowered then) but now i find myself using doomsaw and barbarous blade over this, the only time i use this is if Im dpsing in an instance because of the proc....I wonder if i would get a Nexus Crystal from disenchanting it (i can hardly bare to say it)XD<br /><br />Edited, Thu Feb 16 20:46:04 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would just like to say that execute very obviously depends on the weapon you are using if you have ever actually used it before. The final rank of execute says that it is supposed to do 600 damage plus 9 additional damage per rage point you have... The fact is, this total bull****. There are many times when execute does not do 600 damage. My highest crit with execute with a 2h weapon is also about a 1500 damage higher than my highest crit with a 1h weapon. If you are using a level 60 epic 2h weapon, you are going to be doing an insane amount more damage with execute than you are if you're using a level 60 superior 1h weapon. just my thoughts</div>
