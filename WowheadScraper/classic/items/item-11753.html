You get into the Coffer room, kill everyone in the room or be sneaky(see below), read the painting, & it tells you where the guy you need to kill is which can be in 1 of 6 spawn points usually not too far away. Kill the guy that spawns, loot the bop temporary key & unlock the Vault back in the Coffer room. About 35% of the time you'll get a Burning Essence. Sometimes you might get 2 if you're lucky. \n\nStealthed ways of opening the painting: \n\nIt's all about the mob closest to the painting. If you aggro him you aggro the whole room. If he's level 52 you can stand far enough away from him where you don't aggro him & open the painting. If you have imp sap, sap the guy closest to the painting. If you're able to you can kill him & Vanish. Sometimes he's 52, 53, or 54, & sometimes he's elite which makes it very hard. \n\nAbout the 6 spawn points, they are all soloable, but 2 of them are very difficult. Ofgut in the Garrison spawns near General Angerforge which makes for a 6 elite mob fight. The Grim Guzzler one that appears in the bar room is far away & pretty hard cause if you don't clear the surrounding mobs the whole room aggros. It's quicker & best to just reset instance & get a better spawn point. Those are the 2 that I'd recommend resetting. The other spawn points should be easy. \n\nOn the way there: \n\nBtw as a Rogue going through the Arena is not the best way. Without opening the Shadowforge gate stealth to the bridge & jump out the window to the right when you can't go any further.&nbsp; Go passed Incendius. Then make your way up the Hall of Crafting, go out the door & the Coffer room is the room next to it. It's much faster & there are no dogs to worry about. \n\nRogue soloing the other: \nFirst off there are a bunch of different Keepers of the Key - all with different type of damage they deal. It's important to know what to use for debuffs, this will increase your chances of survival in this 3 against 1 fight with elites. \n\nI also recommend Whipper Root during battle, Crystals from Un'goro - Crystal Ward (+200 Armor), Restore (up to 700 health restored over time, and my favorite - Crystal Charge (AOE for Rogue)\n\n1. The Keeper inside the coffer room (Right where your at - I hope your already stealthed at this point) can be done if you position yourself in the back of the room where you open the coffer box. Then use Distract on the keyholder to seperate him from the group of up to 5 guards. He's an easy 55 Elite caster, but has lot's of help. I actually recommend reseting the instance with this spawn if soloing.\n\n2. The Arena spawn is easy, kill him + 2 guards(or just him & Vanish, he spawns far enough way from the spectators to not aggro others. \n\n3. The Hall of Crafting spawn is him + 2 guards again, just make sure you don't start till the fire elemental goes away(or kill it first. Time the Fire Pat and Golem that comes up from below.\nThis guy hits with Shadow damage - a Shadow protection Pot will greatly help.\n\n4. The domicile spawn is same thing, just be careful of the dog when entering. They are in a little hideaway room by the corner. He spawns in the empty store room - straight up the steps from the first dorway. Hint - kill the Pat in a safe area (maybe to the left inside the door) - the Pat can sometimes be a pain due in part to his roving into your battle, or just time it. \n\n5. The Grim Guzzler - (Requires Shadow Forge key and the gate being closed) Buy up all the Dark Ale from the Bartender (helps to stock up on a run prior to the Coffer Run) and go downstairs to the empty keg room.&nbsp; Drop an Ale and kill as many downstairs patrons as possable - watch out for elites - once ALL patrons are out of agro range from the Key Keeper, sap one guard and killl the keeper - vanish - heal - grab the key! This is very difficult to clear ALL patrons around the Keeper due to the limited number or Ales that can be purchased in one instance, and the four elite patrons that need clearing to avoid adds.\n\n6. West Garrason - (Requires Shadow Forge key and the gate being closed)Across the gate somewhere - I haven't had this spawn as of yet - please post with details if you got em. \n\nThen once you have all the mats, take them to Flame Crest in Burning Steppes & talk to Mathredis Firestar, & you can give him the mats + another 30g for the Arcanum. \n\n***********************************************\n\nI also saw this posted in another Libram tree and though it should be passed along.\n\nThe two letter abbreviations are BS and DM are for where the quest turn in is for that libram.
