Since the launch of WoW Classic, the game has used the spawn times and locations from original World of Warcraft, but population and social factors have led to Black Lotus being much more scarce than it was in original WoW. While these issues affect all mining and herb nodes to some degree, Black Lotus is especially affected because it has the special property of only having one spawn up at a time in each of the zones it spawns in.\n\nIn original WoW, designers planned Black Lotus around a technical limitation – only 10 spawn locations per node type could be active at the same time in the same zone. We no longer have that limitation, but it gives us a design intention that we can work with: Black Lotus was supposed to spawn in the widest variety of locations, while there could only be one up at a time in each zone. As always, our goal is to minimize differences from original World of Warcraft, and we feel this is a case where we can follow that design intention in a way that is warranted by modern conditions as well as beneficial to players.\n\nWe’re going to increase the spawn rate of Black Lotus, and we’re going to add many additional possible spawn locations in each of the Black Lotus zones. With a different hotfix, we’re working on making it so that a player cannot see a Black Lotus on-screen or on their minimap if they’re dead, unless they have 300 Herbalism. \n\nWe’ll have all of these changes noted for you in the next Hotfixes Update that follows them going live.\n\nThank you!\"[\/i]\n\n[small]BLIZZARD POST: https:\/\/eu.forums.blizzard.com\/en\/wow\/t\/black-lotus-and-wsg-adjustments-incoming\/154603[\/small]","date":"2020-05-28T15:14:55-05:00","rating":19,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Guys, lets share new spawns lotos here \/way","creationdate":"2020-05-29T04:03:18-05:00","id":1371760,"rating":2,"commentid":3209301,"dataTree":4,"roles":0,"username":"stenan1","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Spawn at 74, 63 EPL.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Stop asking where they are, the Allakhazam map locations are quite accurate. The problem is that people farm the hell out of black lotus and they only spawn once every hour or two. It's like taming Broken Tooth - takes a measure of perserverance and luck.<br /><br />Mark the map spots, hit them when the server comes up in the morning. You'll get your Black Lotus.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><br /><br />Dear Players,<br /><br /> There are 2 locations that I know of where you can farm the Black Lotus. The first is in Winterspring. One spawn point is in the ruins near the frozen lake southwest of the city Everlook. The second is directly left of the cave entrance to in the Ice Thistle Hills. This cave is located east of Winterspring.<br /><br /> The second location is in the Eastern Plaguelands. In the area know as plaguewood. The trick here is to to look for the towers called Ziggerats on your map. Close to all of these Ziggerat's are cauldrons. There are 3<br />cauldrons, and a Black Lotus can spawn in all 3.<br />There are 2 more locations I know of. There are<br />2 different vales that house higher level undead<br />mobs. A lotus can spawn in either of them. There<br />is also a spawn point for the lotus on the eastern<br />side of Corins Crossing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rothia</b></h3><b><u>BLACK LOTUS AND WSG ADJUSTMENTS INCOMING</u><br />Posted by Kaivax | Blizzard Forums | 2020-05-28</b><br /><br /><i>&quot;Via hotfixes, we’re working on several quality-of-life improvements that should go live in the next few days.<br /><br />Black Lotus scarcity has been consistently among the top issues we’ve seen player feedback about, so we’ve decided to update how we handle Black Lotus spawns. Since the launch of WoW Classic, the game has used the spawn times and locations from original World of Warcraft, but population and social factors have led to Black Lotus being much more scarce than it was in original WoW. While these issues affect all mining and herb nodes to some degree, Black Lotus is especially affected because it has the special property of only having one spawn up at a time in each of the zones it spawns in.<br /><br />In original WoW, designers planned Black Lotus around a technical limitation – only 10 spawn locations per node type could be active at the same time in the same zone. We no longer have that limitation, but it gives us a design intention that we can work with: Black Lotus was supposed to spawn in the widest variety of locations, while there could only be one up at a time in each zone. As always, our goal is to minimize differences from original World of Warcraft, and we feel this is a case where we can follow that design intention in a way that is warranted by modern conditions as well as beneficial to players.<br /><br />We’re going to increase the spawn rate of Black Lotus, and we’re going to add many additional possible spawn locations in each of the Black Lotus zones. With a different hotfix, we’re working on making it so that a player cannot see a Black Lotus on-screen or on their minimap if they’re dead, unless they have 300 Herbalism. <br /><br />We’ll have all of these changes noted for you in the next Hotfixes Update that follows them going live.<br /><br />Thank you!&quot;</i><br /><br />BLIZZARD POST: <a href="https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/black-lotus-and-wsg-adjustments-incoming/154603" rel="nofollow">https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/black-lotus-and-wsg-adjustments-incoming/154603</a></div>
