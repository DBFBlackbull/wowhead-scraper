Some added tips I've found that helped me a lot:\n\n1. Get some cripple poison it can slow a mob just enough to not pull that extra pack.\n2. Blinding powder is a god send it can save you when taking on those packs of 3 allows for max CC and minimum damage.\n3. Throw a gouge on the mob you aren't targeting that extra time (5 sec if you imp i believe) can help a lot with taking less damage.\n4.

Didn't keep count of Invokers, but we cleared both them and the Pyromancers in hopes of the Archmage pattern. Reset 3 times before the pattern dropped, put it up on the AH, hope it sells. We both have alchemist alts as well, so we'll be going back more than a few times to get more, but once you get the system down and keep an eye out for the respawning pat, it goes pretty smooth. As a rogue, prep and imp sap go a long way towards survivability on this job. Also the imp. cooldown on evasion and vanish. Crippling poison is a must, and if the hunter is a BM hunter with a good tanking pet it makes it go a little faster as well. \n\nClear the pats, then work through the 3 pulls, sapping the Melee units, and burning the casters down. If you have access to a lot of fadeleaf for blinding powder it can also buy you a little extra time. They drop 2 debuffs on you, which when stacked can mean death even after you've left combat. One increases fire dmg taken by 1000, yes, One Thousand, the other deals ~750 dmg every 6 second for 4 minutes. With them stacked it will hit you for an easy ~1750 dmg every 60 seconds, so be careful, learned that one the hard way. Bringing in a Druid for decurse\/heals would make this almost too easy, but then you would be splitting profits 3 ways instead of 2. ;-)\n\nThe 4 pulls can be done with 2 people, just takes some good timing. We would usually burn two casters down then, depending on our health remaining, we would either attempt to finish off the other two, or feign\/vanish and med up for another try at the last 2. The Melee units (can't remember the name off the top of my head) have mortal strike and it hits like a truck on leather. Let the pet hold aggro as long as possible even if he dies, i.e. spam feint. \n\nAs to gear, both of us have no gear past Dungeon sets, I think the only epic between the two of us was my Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom. I went in with zero health pots, but used bandages freely, as the mobs drop runecloth at a pretty steady rate. I also kept a stack of deviate fish (easy to fish up lots of them) because about 80% of the time it heals you for ~450hp and is on a seperate timer from potions. Just remember not to cook them. ;-) Also hitting up a mage beforehand for some of the good food and water saves a nice chunk of cash, just be sure to tip them. :)\n\nAnything bigger than a 4 pull is pretty much suicide, and we tried multiple times with multiple methods. I would say that a 3rd person would make the difference here, best bet would be a druid, they're so versatile. ;-)\n\nHope this helps anyone planning to get this recipe, we've got our money maker now so I'm not worried about competition.

Some added tips I've found that helped me a lot:<br /><br />1. Get some cripple poison it can slow a mob just enough to not pull that extra pack.<br />2. Blinding powder is a god send it can save you when taking on those packs of 3 allows for max CC and minimum damage.<br />3. Throw a gouge on the mob you aren't targeting that extra time (5 sec if you imp i believe) can help a lot with taking less damage.<br />4. Bring Tea and ZG trinket <br /><br />Hopefully those help a little more but the video laid most the ground work now just give it a try it well worth the time.</div>

The other one won the first drop and passed on the second, and I won that one. :)<br />Potions can be sold quite easily and with good prices, considering that reagents are not hard to find.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>25 invokers down... hopefully no more than 25 invokers left. Solo farming them isn't too bad, but using two rogues would give you access to all the spawns rather than just the groups of 2. <br /><br />Edited, Thu Dec 22 15:10:48 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Me (60 Rogue) and my brother (60 Hunter) were able to pretty much clear the whole camp area. Didn't keep count of Invokers, but we cleared both them and the Pyromancers in hopes of the Archmage pattern. Reset 3 times before the pattern dropped, put it up on the AH, hope it sells. We both have alchemist alts as well, so we'll be going back more than a few times to get more, but once you get the system down and keep an eye out for the respawning pat, it goes pretty smooth. As a rogue, prep and imp sap go a long way towards survivability on this job. Also the imp. cooldown on evasion and vanish. Crippling poison is a must, and if the hunter is a BM hunter with a good tanking pet it makes it go a little faster as well. <br /><br />Clear the pats, then work through the 3 pulls, sapping the Melee units, and burning the casters down. If you have access to a lot of fadeleaf for blinding powder it can also buy you a little extra time. They drop 2 debuffs on you, which when stacked can mean death even after you've left combat. One increases fire dmg taken by 1000, yes, One Thousand, the other deals ~750 dmg every 6 second for 4 minutes. With them stacked it will hit you for an easy ~1750 dmg every 60 seconds, so be careful, learned that one the hard way. Bringing in a Druid for decurse/heals would make this almost too easy, but then you would be splitting profits 3 ways instead of 2. ;-)<br /><br />The 4 pulls can be done with 2 people, just takes some good timing. We would usually burn two casters down then, depending on our health remaining, we would either attempt to finish off the other two, or feign/vanish and med up for another try at the last 2. The Melee units (can't remember the name off the top of my head) have mortal strike and it hits like a truck on leather. Let the pet hold aggro as long as possible even if he dies, i.e. spam feint. <br /><br />As to gear, both of us have no gear past Dungeon sets, I think the only epic between the two of us was my Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom. I went in with zero health pots, but used bandages freely, as the mobs drop runecloth at a pretty steady rate. I also kept a stack of deviate fish (easy to fish up lots of them) because about 80% of the time it heals you for ~450hp and is on a seperate timer from potions. Just remember not to cook them. ;-) Also hitting up a mage beforehand for some of the good food and water saves a nice chunk of cash, just be sure to tip them. :)<br /><br />Anything bigger than a 4 pull is pretty much suicide, and we tried multiple times with multiple methods. I would say that a 3rd person would make the difference here, best bet would be a druid, they're so versatile. ;-)<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone planning to get this recipe, we've got our money maker now so I'm not worried about competition. Any more that we get go to us, and then to our guild Alchies. <br /><br />Have fun and good luck!<br /><br />Wolg<br />My gear: <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?1598315">Wolgan</a> (I guess I lied, I do have the crossbow from the quest to kill the first boss in AQ20 and ZG, but beyond that it's all non raid gear.) <br />My Brothers Gear: <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?1281815">Kyenn</a><br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 21st 2006 at 12:09pm PDT by Wolgan</i></div>
