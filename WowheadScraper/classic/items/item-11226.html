I bought some crappy cloth gloves and boots to put the stuff on and it works fine for me.&nbsp; The only thing i'm worried about is if I get dismounted in pvp, say concussive shot, charge stun etc..will it switch back to my main gear, or will it leave me in the crap gear because I'm considered &quot;in combat&quot;?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the confusion with 100% of mount speed (100% + 75%) comes from the fact that some are referring to the normal level 40 mount speed as 100%. But when used in the same context as the description of the mount (speed increased by 60% of normal run speed), you can't use 100%. Therefore, the 15% increase caused by equipping the carrot and getting the mithril spurs and riding enchant would be a 75% increase (60% from lvl 40 mount + 15%) to normal run speed when mounted. Not 175% or even 115%. Just thought I'd clear that up for everyone.</div>

SlotNumber is listed in ascending order from left to right, top to bottom.<br />- Place your mount, carrot, boots, and gloves in your backpack slots 1, 2, 3, and 4.<br />- This is a simple macro, but it will switch your gear even if you can't mount. I suggest either selecting a different looking pair of gloves from your normal ones, or add code to whisper yourself a note that you've mounted.<br />- It is also advisable that you NOT use this macro when talking to a vendor. It will sell the equipment in the designated slots. Not lethal, you can always buy them back, but a pain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As for those who think this is a poor enchant compared to others, they're absolutely right. But also notice, that there are addons that allow fast swapping of equipment by keybinding or pressing a button - you can even make your own addon so that when you mount you automatically change to a different outfit. That having said, the total 18% speed increase (with epic mount) is very handy and as you spend alot of time with travelling through WoW (30% of your time online, calculate how much time that is since you started playing)I couldn't possibly live without this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are several mods out there that change your your equpied items when you get on and off your horse. I use the mod called &quot;wardrobe&quot;. It is very nice. If I get knocked off of my horse it changes to my non riding gear as soon as I get out of battle. I can understand why a rogue or hunter might want agility instead. It all depends on what you are doing. I have so many chanes of closes I have room for this on one set. I can change my clothes at the click of a button. If you do the new AB you have got to have your rding gear on at the begining. If you don't the other side will get the flag b4 you. <br /><br />This does make it faster. When AV still existed I was always the first to Iceblood graveyeard. If you are going on any kind of long ride it is a must to have all the improvements.<br /><br />This is on Azgalar AH for 200g right now. I think it normaly goes for 100g-150g. I think somebody is a bit hopefull.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Sep 28 04:51:43 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>heh. just got this off a level 1 gold farmer for 25g. he listed it for 20g no buyout.. told him id buy it right now for 20.. he says 30.. i say 25.. he agrees.<br /><br />then he tried to get my money first before giving me the pattern. how cute.<br /><br />anyhow, this doesnt stack with riding crop as most people know, but riding crop is also level 69 so there's still a great market for this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With the enchant, carrot and the spurs you get a 215% speed increase.<br /><br />Normal speed = 100%<br />Epic mount speed = +100% <br /><br />this alone is 200%<br /><br />Spurs +7%<br />Carrot+3%<br />Riding skill enchant+5%<br /><br />The enchant sells for 20G on Dragonblight server. Totally not worth it considering +7 agility enchant is better for gloves. Even Strength is better for gloves.<br /><br />Don't let anyone con you into saying &quot;buy a cheap pair of gloves and have them enchanted&quot;. I did that with boots, now I have the problem of having to swap boots every time I mount up, making it incredibly annoying, especially if you're trying to run in PvP, which makes it difficult to swap. Definetly not worth the 20G, definetly not worth the 50G for the plans, and definetly not worth replacing a better enchant.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was just checking enchanting formulas earlier today and this is one I didn't have. Looked at the drop rates and thought I'd never get it. Then I went to kill some incendosaurs to get scales and this dropped. Never been this lucky before. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got it from a heavy mithril lockbox... one of my alts is a chanter but for fun not profit, so i decided to sell it. my auctioneer suggested 45g start with a 60g buyout... but i roll on a very heavily populated server, and figured there were some rich chanters that would just have to have it.... so i put it up for 80-99g and it sold to someone in the major raiding guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there is still a big use for this pattern imo, since there are plenty of blood elves and draenei alts being leveled, who can't quite use the riding crop yet. I just got the pattern for my enchanter alt for 50g on Cho'gall, kind of steep, but the level 2 rogue named Fangweihong didn't seem to understand my attempts to bargain. Gee wonder why.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Previdencia</b></h3>Where does it drop from?<br /><br />Dungeons: <br />It drops from <a href="/classic/npc=13323/subterranean-diemetradon">Subterranean Diemetradon</a> (the lizards) in Maraudon, about 1 chance in 1000. <br />It also drops from <a href="/classic/npc=8912/twilights-hammer-torturer">Twilight's Hammer Torturer</a>, in BRD (1 chance in 2000).<br /><br />Raid bosses:<br />All dragon raid/world bosses e.g. Onyxia and Emeriss (1% chance).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wyr3d</b></h3>The value of this formula appears to vary on my server. A few hours ago it was selling for 175g. Currently it's at 125g, I can understand the high initial price, given the potential value of the enchant over time. It is certainly a more reliable purchase same a lot of leatherworking recipes ==<br /><br />The riding speed boost is valuable for all classes, all levels - and while speed boosts are relatively small, they does stack with other boosts. This makes them highly sought after throughout the phases for PVP.<br /><br />Given that this recipe is still fetching high prices in Retail about 10,000g last I checked the AH, I can only assume that 2% increase is still highly sought after</div>
