You have to tank the damage with frost ward and ice barrier, so they take about 75% of your mana to kill, sometimes if the rng isnt in your favor, they will kill you and you wont be able to do anything about it(around 3 times for me).\n\nBut the whelps are the worst, they resist cc, burn mana, do splash damage while you are slowed. Depending on the pack you get, you have a better chance of killing 2 elite cobalts than reliably kill whelps without using pots and all your cooldowns.

Farming (soloing) them was pretty easy for me as a shadow priest, but the large flying dragons and the melee dragonkin can be a bit more difficult.<br /><br />The mageweavers also drop the arcanite dragonling recipe and all the dragonkin there have a chance to drop blue dragon sinew, which makes this a pretty good farming zone as both sell for a considerable amount on the AH.<br /><br />The robe is actually one of my rare patterns that gets the most requests and even now there are few active tailors with the pattern learned since it is BOP and basically needs to be intentionally farmed for.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6460</b></h3>This is a very nice robe especially considering the mats required and the level of the item. I did a little work in southern Winterpspring grinding/questing and picked up this recipie.<br /><br />Making robes and selling can provide good money and the robe doesn't look too shabby either. :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>16077</b></h3>I can craft low levels this excellent item. Ahn'Qiraj - EU - Alliance - Karafauxtr (Level 70 warlock)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm guessing it's called Winter Night because it has bonuses to Frost and Shadow damage, not because the drop rate increases at night...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well i can say this a tough farm, for a frost mage anyway.<br /><br />1) The mageweavers are quite rare here, maybe 1/5 is a mageweaver.<br />2) After you kill one, it respawns as a different type of cobalt.&nbsp; This means u have to kill all kinds of mobs here in order to get mageweavers to spawn.<br />3) The other mobs are quite tough to kill, even for a lvl60 mage.&nbsp; The mageweavers are quite easy if u use frost ward and ice barrier, get in close with fireblasts/scorch/fireball, but the other mobs hit hard and are resisty.<br />4) the drop rate is less than 2%, which means the average player will kill 50 before they get the pattern.&nbsp; So until u have killed 50 you cant say you are unlucky.&nbsp; Its hard to find 50 :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I registered just to share my pain on getting that item. almost 3 days now, 3 days of which I have spent a lot of time online. I lost count after 100 mobs... which was very long time ago. I have never left the place other than for emptying bags in everlook. Found 7 recipes for that arcane potion 1 pattern for throium leggings, 3 mithril lockboxes, 20+ random green drops, 1 serpentine sash, and I have made more than 100g simply by selling the vendor gray items :x<br /><br />I really can't believe that its droprate is as high as thottbot claims it to be. <br /><br />Edit: One more day.<br /><br />Not even sure anymore but I think that I now possess 9 recipes for greater arcanite protection potion, found 2 more thorium lockboxes, um I'd say around 10 green items, a few gems, as always #$%^load of gray items and cash, well, but just as to prove that my insane farming for that recipe isn't completely useless I found one epic sinew too :), but still no Pattern for Robe of Winter Night. <br /><br />Edit2: Yet another day<br /><br />Something new, Haven't found even a single greater arcanite protection potion recipe today, but I did find yet another thorium lockbox, Pattern for felcoth shoulders, of course a lot of greens and grays, and well what do you say, 2nd Blue Mature Dragon Sinew in two days, but still no pattern that I am after, I was about to give up when I read that the guy who posted after me claimed that there indeed still exists such a pattern &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />Edit: A lot of days later<br /><br />I've been farming for this for who knows how long, a few hours a day for sure, I have found an insane amount of other recipes and patterns, I can't count how many greens, The &quot;rare&quot; elite mob I have killed more than 20 times by now, The funny thing is though, that I have by now found 6 Mature Blue Dragon Sinews while hunting for the drop, sure it has made the hunters in my guild happy and by selling a few I have made decent money, but comparing the droprates, by the time I have 6 Mature Blue Dragon Sinews I should have around 120 Patterns: Robe of Winter Night, not having a single one is not unluck, its pure insanity</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have looked for this pattern for waaaaay too long with my priest. I have been to the cave, inside out at least 20 times, if not (more than likely) more, and still no pattern. I have found like 6 of the Greater Arcane Protection Potion Recipes, a couple of different engineering schematics, and at least 10 other greens, and a couple of blues. I know, I know.... as soon as I leave, some lucky son of a you-know-what finds it on their first kill, but this is ridiculous! When I go farming for it, I am there for at least 3 hours each time. I even pulled two different 6 hour straight search and no find missions. So good luck to whoever the next lucky bearer of the Robe of Winter Night Pattern is. Just remember it's BOP, so if there is a tailor in your group, let them have it as it won't do anyone else any good. My priest is a level 60 shadow priest, with just one epic-- a Glowing Brightwood staff with +22 int on it, and only half of her devout set (all the rest are blues, though), and she can solo all but the huge flying dragons inside and out of Mazthoril just fine. That is, as long as it is one at a time, or just one set of 3 of the little flying guys. She may come mighty close to biting it, and has to eat and drink after every fight, but I haven't died very many times other than when Spellmaw or Brumeran comes along at an extremely inopportune moment.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After a week of farming, very little blues, and no epics...&nbsp; I finally got the recipe.&nbsp; Making them for cheap on Spirestone if anyone is interested pst Pyrobob</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think I've spent a total of about 8 hours farming for this but got it in the end. :D Found that the Mageweavers tend to spawn a lot less than the Scalebanes and Wyrmkin, and I agree with someone here; the hardest mobs for a mage (particularly me being a frost mage) are those pesky tiny dragon things.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wewt...3rd day Finally droped..off and on grinding between BG's and what not.. 4 recipes of Greater Arcane Protection droped..2 hand fulls of greys and a handfull of greens which i d/e'd&nbsp; Made a Grib of G tho&nbsp; :D it'll finally drop.. just gotta kill everything.. ...Funny part was I logged of 1 of the computers cause the Video card was over heating..I took a 20 min break , logged back on, on another computer, and Killed the first mageweaveer I saw and it droped.. was rather stoked.. so Good luck adveturers, Cashe and Prizes await those who seek it and are patient</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So I saw this pattern on thottbot and thought it would be good to grind while leveling.&nbsp; Went into the cave, and got it to drop off the very first guy.&nbsp; Now, I guess I should go start grinding some ridiculous stuff with this kind of luck?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dropped for me on the 26th mageweaver.&nbsp; others are correct, u must kill the more common cobalts as the mageweavers spawn more infrequently.&nbsp; <br /><br />total cobalts killed might be close to 75, all killed outside of the cave.<br /><br />got some nice drops but certainly not enough to make me want to go back!&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />tough grind, but worth it imho.<br /><br />good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Loreya</b></h3>Took me like 3 Days of Farming to get the Robe-Pattern to drop. The worst thing about this farm is that the Mageweavers are pretty rare and you have to kill all Elites to make them spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>EquineForm</b></h3>I had a weird suspicion that they would drop late at night for me and they did, around 3:00am. It seems like a lot of other people who end up actually getting this pattern get it late at night/early in the morning... hmmm...<br />Definitely not saying these will NOT drop during the day, but 'ya know, programmers put in some pretty weird stuff sometimes that we may never find out about.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dauble</b></h3>Finally got this after 3 days of relentless farming as shadow priest lvl 60.<br />I found out that the fastest way was clearing the tunnel back and forth, this way you also avoid strong not-soloable elites like Spellmaw. Elite re-spawn rates are quite fast and the cave has a lot of spawn points on small area. This way you find enough Mageweavers to kill. Happy farming!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Yabaz</b></h3>As a frost mage, all the cobalts suck, they resist about 20-25% of spells, but the mageweavers resist counterspell about 60% of the time, and resist spells about 30-35%. I started at level 57, and it doesn't get much better with levels. You have to tank the damage with frost ward and ice barrier, so they take about 75% of your mana to kill, sometimes if the rng isnt in your favor, they will kill you and you wont be able to do anything about it(around 3 times for me).<br /><br />But the whelps are the worst, they resist cc, burn mana, do splash damage while you are slowed. Depending on the pack you get, you have a better chance of killing 2 elite cobalts than reliably kill whelps without using pots and all your cooldowns. Going into the cave isn't really an option since some spawn points are shared with whelps. Your best bet is to stay outside and farm the 6-7 on the on the left side, from the entrance of the cave to the farthest point back, where you see spellmaw every few minutes, reminding you of your failure, and also gives you the chance to escape if the resists are just way too high.<br /><br />I have the worst luck, so here is my final tally:<br /><br />Kills:<br />258 mageweavers<br />232 wyrmkins<br />233 scalebanes<br />15 whelps<br /><br />Loot:<br />Around 100g in silver and greys<br />3 Mana pots<br />12 Health pots<br />15-20 Greens<br />1 Blue Sword, Demonslayer<br />6 Recipe: Greater Arcane Protection Potion<br />2 Travelers Backpacks<br />1 Mature Blue Dragon Sinew (at 223 mageweavers killed) This probably made it worth vs farming a more AH desirable item<br /><br />Around 25 hours over 3 days<br />3 full levels 57-60<br />killed 3 more after hitting 60 and got it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kalmus</b></h3>WoW Classic update as of 2020 May 12<br /><br />Decided to start farming these on my 53 shadow priest today with a 60 hunter (hoping for a blue sinew) and 60 rogue (hoping to beat the hunter on the sinew and sell it to him for 300g).<br /><br />We farmed for about 1 hour running back and forth in the cave not really getting anything, then just as I was about to log off for a meeting we got 4 of this pattern off 4 mageweavers. I only needed the one of course, but greed-roll won the other 3 as well.<br /><br />Also during that last 5 minutes we got the alchemy recipe for Greater Arcane Protection Potion which I greed won. <br /><br />During this hour we also got 4 greens.
