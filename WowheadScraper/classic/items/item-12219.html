<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>and what is it for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got one to drop off the quartermaster... lucky day I guess</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it drops a lot, but as a poster above said, people just pick em up so the chance of you getting one depends on how many people in your group already have it, if it's your time to loot or maybe you're doing the instance with people who look out for that kind of thing... good luck with it, i promiss you it drops more than once per run, check the chat/combat logs and you'll notice :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was in a group with a friend when he turned in this to the Questgiver.&nbsp; If you are in a 5 man group with the person turning in the Seal of Ascension to Vaelan, you can get the quest for the gems as well.&nbsp; My rogue got the quest this way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Man this thing doesn't seem to drop as much as it used to. I've been on 6 LBRS raids in the past week and only saw this drop for someone in party once.&nbsp; A few months ago I was in a raid group with my hunter where it actually dropped 9 (yes, NINE) times in one run. I think the extras just went on AH or were vendored. I shoulda saved one, now I cant seem to get one at all for my druid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We went yesterday and we dropped 4 of these but it was a very good drop raid lots of blue and my new epic ring :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>but sharing it is pointless. You need the 3 gems, and the seal before you can even turn in the quest, and as soon as you obtain the seal, you can always get the quest. So gather the gems and the seal, and then go get the quest, and immediatly turn it in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got this one from LBRS raid today (we were actually going for the key but no one knew how to get it lol) and we cleaned it for full but I never knew I could turn this in for the UBRS key. I think we killed the dude, but it only works in a 5 man party? And how do you get the gems?<br />There was also a drop of something similar to this, called Undead instead of Acension I think, it's also needed? I could only loot one, no more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was in a 5 man and I got 1 right away and then saw many many more drop on corpse's i was looting (unique only 1 allowed), at least 4... Blizz may have changed the drop rate cuz i cant imagine doing multiple runs and nvr getting one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was going into Lower blackrock spire and I killed the two first elites. the first one droped this and I have no Idea what its for. I was solo, btw. lvl 57 hunter</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got 2 of these almost back to back when going solo. No raid, no team. I left one of them on the ground, want it? :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What are the gems in getting the key for UBRS and where do I get the quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you want to know more about the seal and the gems visit this quest:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4742/seal-of-ascension">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4742/seal-of-ascension</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>...i tellya!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>can everyone in group pick it up if it drops? or just one?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To get the quest to make the UBRS-key you have to have the Unadorned Seal of Ascension in your inventory when you talk to Vaelan. The quest can be shared once you have it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This item is for the UBRS key.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>whats this for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>why won't this damn thing drop for me, i've gotten all the damn gems, no seal, wtf...damn blizzard, O well, at least it gives me something else to look for while i farm omokk for my skyshroud leggings</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's used in this quest <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4742">Seal of Acension</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Its worth noting that they do NOT bind on pickup. If you have the three gems and can't find this, try buying it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just got all 3 gems in one run, party left and only rogue and me (hunter) stayed inside to gank patrols.<br /><br />3rd patrol dropped this beauty &lt;3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Second time I was in LBRS, got my last gem on the same run. It just dropped all of a sudden. I looted and made lots of &quot;Woohoo&quot;'ing and /cheer'ing, but the other guys just asked what it was for, and I said it was a quest item. Ok, they said, and we went on as if nothing had happened. Even the guy who had claimed to be collecting gemstones ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kanariya</b></h3>It annoyingly still drops even after you've completed the quests, and even if you have <a href="/classic/item=12344/seal-of-ascension">Seal of Ascension</a> on you. <br /><br />If you plan on farming LBRS after you've gotten your UBRS key, you can bank this item to stop seeing them drop.</div>
