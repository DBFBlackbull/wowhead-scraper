Within 24hours of real time, you'll get a letter and a gift in the mail. The letter will thank you for continuing to be a dues-paying Gnome Engineer (as if you had a choice in the matter) and attached will be a gift. There is a chance that the gift will be this schematic. Other gifts I've gotten have been random low-level (iron and below) engineering parts, or small piles of blasting powders (again, the best I've gotten is heavy powder). Some people consider it worth the gold to repeatedly renew their card every time they get the gift until they get this schematic.

When you look at your money bag, you just see that you started with 200g and only got 10g left.. I know a guy that did like that, and he went so angry when i got it in first try. But maybe try it one, two, maybe three times, but dont make it a &quot;sport&quot; if you know what i mean.. you can get everything in that gift from mithril chasing to this recipie. And its the same thing with pet bombling, which the goblin engineers can get, it all remain on how lucky you are that day, and i was really luckey that day i found the lil'smokey recipie in my mail box. <br /> But think before renewing your card..

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; I just thought people who are trying to get this robot should know...dont start trying to get this thing unless you have a LOT of money to burn.&nbsp; Sure, its possible that you can get this on the first renewal, but its not likely.&nbsp; I for one have spent over 110g so far, and still no schematic.&nbsp; What's funny is, I have gotten EVERYTHING else that is possible to get from the gift renewals...All the BS stuff (mitiril tubes, etc), parachute cloak, and even the lame &quot;catseye goggles&quot; which according to thoughtbott is even more rare of drop then lil smokey.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I cant really tell you how frustarting it is everyday when I play...to go the mailbox (24 hours later) to check my 10 gifts (I renew my membership 20g at a time) and get the same old crap over and over.&nbsp; Its like playing the lotto with this thing, and your chances of winning are extremly slim.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some guy on here said he spent over 200g before he got his, and I bet the average overall is about 50g.&nbsp; Sadly, im gonna keep trying for this thing simply because its practically an EPIC item.&nbsp; There is probably no more than 5 people that have them on any given server, and they are also the only small pet I think that makes noises, effects, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ill post back here when and IF I get this damn thing, but im guessing with my luck I will have the record for most gold spent trying...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this today on my fourth or fifth renewal, so while it is extremely rare, there's always a chance that you'll get lucky quickly.<br /><br />Besides, he's a really unique little pet, worth the 10g I spent for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I finally got my lil smokey today after probably spending more than (most likely) anybody ever has on him...240 gold.&nbsp; I went crazy yesterday and decided to renew my memebership 30 times in 1 day after failing to get it so many times at the rate of 10 renewals a day.&nbsp; It paid off, but thats a hella a lot of money to spend for a pet robot.&nbsp; I hope nobody else has to go through the same hassle I went through to get this thing...and I envy all of you that got him in your first try, cause you just saved yourself an arm and a leg...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got it on me second renewal :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i dunno if you all missed it on your first try, or something bad happened...<br /><br />but I got him on my first try, my buddy got his bomb pet on his first try, and 4 other friends on different servers all got them on their first try.<br /><br />this was all in the past month or two, so i dunno if people on this thread are unlucky, or if they upped the drop rate in a recent patch to be guaranteed first try?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can horde get this?<br /><br />and does some 1 have a screen shot :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; To the post above, yes you and your friends were all just lucky.&nbsp; I dont think the drop rate in the mail is 4% like thoughbott said (probably a little higher, around 8-10%) but it defintly isnt normal to get it on your first try.&nbsp; Average is 10-30 renewals.&nbsp; Then you got the people like me who never have any luck in this game at all, and it takes well over 50+ renewals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't remember for sure how much I've spent on my Gnome engineering character (Gnome Warlock) renewing hoping to get this, but all I keep getting are Unstable Triggers and Mithril Casings! I don't think I've received anything else yet except those items, and its getting on my nerves.<br /><br />I really wish this schematic dropped somewhere....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've spent 100g trying to get this, not a big deal I have plenty of gold to burn at level 60 and not much to spend it on.&nbsp; I have been doing renews in 25 time incremements daily... maybe tomorrow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't understand how to get it.. the 2g thing. I bought one in Tinker Town for 2g.. I didnt got any mail, Or i just have to wait? :O:O:O:O:O <br />Please help! I want that little thing!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; You have to wait 24 full hours after you renew, then you will get a gift in the mail.&nbsp; You can do this 30 times in 1 day if you want (and get 30 gifts the next day).&nbsp; It can be real frustrating since its is a low mail rate, but it will be well worth in the end trust me.&nbsp; If it was a high drop rate, you would see them all over the place which would make them lame just like the worg pup/spider hatchling.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Im still the only person ive seen on my server with it.&nbsp; Im sure there is more, just never seen them in 5 months of having him.&nbsp; I hope they never change it, its probably the rarest pet in the game with the pet bombling.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm sorry, but what do you mean by &quot;card renewal&quot;? Are you talking about the initial choice you make for Gnomish Engineering?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i'm fairly sure its the same thing as the pet bombling except for gnomish engineers. every time you renew your membership, you will be sent a package in the mail about 24 hours later, and i think that this has a chance of dropping in the package. its around 5% for the pet bombling though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If I don't renew can I go Gnome Engineering ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>According to the 1.10 upcoming patch notes, leatherworkers and engineers are indeed allowed to respecialize when they quit. Time to master goblin, get the bomb, then go gnome for the devices and this methinks :D!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You CAN renew as many times as you want in a row, and get that many gifts. You DO need to destroy your card every time, or else the quest will detect a &quot;duplicate item&quot; and not complete. Just keep destroying it, clicking the quest, completing, paying 2G, until you feel like you've paid enough. You can do this once or 100 times (there might be a cap, if you're putting more than 20g into this at a time you might want to back off). Then go about your merry way, check your box tomorrow and see if your gambling has paid off. So far I have gotten all Unstable Triggers, Mithril Casings, and Mithril Tubes, and some lower Green Schematics like Catseye Ultra Goggles. So they seem to have made the gift items on par with the renew price. I think I've made a profit off it, no one ever puts those things up at AH =). Hoping for my rare pet soon though. (Thought: what you get in the mail, not counting the pet, may change according to what your skill level is. Not sure if this is true. But unless you NEED this pet at level 40, wait until 60 when you can maybe get better junk items and have more money to blow)<br /><br />Edited, Thu Sep 22 19:35:23 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How do you get this? It looks like it might be from a quest or instance for it to be a bind on pickup item.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Jan 16 21:59:48 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well I destroyed my card and renewed, but I have yet to get any packages in the mail. is it 24 hours real time, or played time?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If I don't renew can I go Gnome Engineering ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You do not automatically get this schematic when you become a Gnomish Engineer.<br /><br />After you are a Gnomish Engineer, the quest giver for the Gnomish Engineer Quest (as well as artisan Gnomish Engineer NPC's scattered about the world that teach you schematics) will give you the option of renewing your Gnomish Engineer Membership. You don't need to destroy the card to do this, you don't need to have the card to do this, you just need to be a Gnomish Engineer. You can even do this before your old card expires.<br /><br />After you choose to renew your membership, which costs 2g - no faction discount - you will be given a new card (or a &quot;refill&quot; of your current card) good for another 14 days. Within 24hours of real time, you'll get a letter and a gift in the mail. The letter will thank you for continuing to be a dues-paying Gnome Engineer (as if you had a choice in the matter) and attached will be a gift. There is a chance that the gift will be this schematic. Other gifts I've gotten have been random low-level (iron and below) engineering parts, or small piles of blasting powders (again, the best I've gotten is heavy powder). Some people consider it worth the gold to repeatedly renew their card every time they get the gift until they get this schematic. I'm not sure if renewing before your gift arrives gets you two gifts, or only one.<br /><br />Hope this helps. :)<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jul 6 17:08:00 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where does this drop?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PracticeJZ</b></h3>Alright guys, let me clarify things for you. First, after renewing your membership card you will not receive any gifts immediately, however, you are going to receive gift boxes by mail 24h later. It's worth noting that you get one gift box per renewal and you can renew as many as membership cards as you want. Now, you can get this schematic exactly from these gift boxes. From what I have experienced, the drop rate is low. I spent around 120g to get mine. Other things I got from gift boxes are Mithril tubes, Mithril casings, Unstable triggers, Schematic: Parachute Cloak, and Schematic: Catseye Ultra Goggles.<br />Have a nice day!</div>
