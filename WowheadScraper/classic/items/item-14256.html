Be prepared to come back later because these mobs are heavily camped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tilgare</b></h3>Another nice place to farm felcloth: the jadefire in northwest felwood. I found about 10 in an hour... though, I farmed 2 hours after that and didn't get a single one... felcloth is fairly difficult to find. In the process you grab some runecloth, demonic runes, and broken crappy weapons to sell to vendors, so it is worth a little farming here too. Also heavily camped...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>598</b></h3>Definitely bring a healer with you if you go farm these satyrs, not so they can heal you but so they can need on the runes to use for raids. Azshara is definitely the easiest place to farm at the Legashi Satyr encampments. There are 3 different camps and usually not too much competition for them ( at least on my server, Gorgonash). so you can ride from camp to camp and just clear each one out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3>DM east is a nice place to farm for Felwood. Get a group 3-4 ppl should do it. Kill all the satyr trash and demons in there.<br />When</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Spent about 40 mins killing Jadefires in Felwood at Jadefire Run tonight, killed LOTS and not a single piece dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I agree.&nbsp; I got some to drop off of Legashis at the above percentages and I've never got anything to drop off Jadefires.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i was grinding at azshara since lvl 49 to lvl 53 and i got like 2 and half stacks of Felcloth there from the Legashi satyrs in the 2 camps and also got like 500 runecloth and lots of librams =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i'm a level 58 warlock farming felcloth for my robe of the void and the best place to farm is defintely jadefire glen, the small jadefire camp just west of deadmaw village in th southwest corner of felwood.&nbsp; the satyrs are slightly lower level than the other two camps, few people know about this place and the drop rate is just as good as any other satyr camp in felwood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I grinded tailoring to 300 in one day + took another day to grind regeants needed for Robe of the Void. I'd say the best place to grind felcloth is in Azhara, on the northern peninsula around the easternmost demon camp. As a warlock, I could dot the whole camp and just kite them around until they died. Then after picking the loot, they'd respawn.<br /><br />In comparison to Felwood demon grinding, the drops were completely different. In Felwood, after 1 hour of grinding I managed to get 4 demonic runes and 1 felcloth. In Azhara, in that same time I got 6 felcloth and 1 demonic rune. All in all, it took me about 5 hours to collect 45 felcloths.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the drop rates on this and every other thottbot page are NOT supplied by Bliz. they are information collected off everyday players like yourself who are generous enough to run the thottbot add on and upload the information it collects. <br /><br />therefore the information in the drop rate charts is absolutely 100% correct, it is real time kills versus drops data from players in the game.<br /><br />this is a rare'ish sort of drop, and hence the price, it would also explain the statistical anomolies encountered when it is such a small drop rate. (around 3 to 4 % generally) <br /><br />unfortunately you will always have people posting on here that &quot;i grinded 4 eva and got nuffin&quot;. <br /><br />when you have killed between 40 and 60 THOUSAND NPC's and still have &quot;nuffin&quot; then I will listen to you, because the drop rates stated on this page are actual kills made by real people, people who are generous enough to run the thottbot add on and upload their information.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>56 Warlock here farming 40 felcloth and 20 demonic runes for Robe of the Void.<br /><br />I'm a little dissappointed with the info posted here on thottbot, usually it's really helpful, but what I'm reading on felcloth is a little vague or inaccurate.<br /><br />You can farm felcloth and demonic runes from the Jadefires in Felwood or the Legashi in Aszhara. My experience has been that Jadefire wins hands down..<br /><br />The droprate in Azhara is incomparable to Jadefire. After a few hours in both, and noticing how pitiful Aszhara drops were looking I asked 4 and everyone pointed me back to Jadefire. Thats for both felcloth and demonic runes. Jadefire = higher droprate than aszhara. <br /><br />A lot of people complain about the opposing faction in Jadefire.. I play alliance on a high pop pvp server and most of the time the horde don't bother me if I don't bother them, it's surprisingly peaceful. Especially fellow warlocks.<br /><br />In conclusion: FARM THESE IN JADEFIRE.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>has the drop rate increased? I got 11 felcloth after about 3-4 wipes (60-80 kills?) of their base in the NorthWest section of felwood. After having 3 with less than 10 kills I thought it was a fluke, but they kept dropping regularly. Had one in the bank, makes 12, won't be back for quite a while!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey guys, just wanted to let you guys know that the drop rate is not broken at all.&nbsp; I'm hunting Legashi's and here is what I got in an hour and a half.<br /><br />Runecloth x 44<br />Felcloth x 6<br />Demonic Rune x 5<br />Major Healing pot x 2<br />Major Mana pot x 1<br />4 Green Items<br />Scroll of Str III x 1<br />Scroll of Agility III x 1<br />Didn't count gold<br /><br />Hope this help at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just visit the vendor Vi'el in Winterspring...he is in Whispering Gorge...see the quest &quot;Shifty Merchant&quot; for more details. He sells 2 Felcloth for 80s each. The respawn rate is about 2 hours.<br />Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was grinding the satyrs in Azshara last night for about an hour and I ended up with 7 felcloth. I also found a rare spawn which was a blue colored satyr, cant remember his name, but he ended up dropping a blue item for me called the Guttbuster (Gun). All in all, a very successful hour of grinding. Last I checked, the felcloth were selling for about 2 gold in the AH. I am on Ysondre.<br /><br />Also, I am level 54 human rogue and I have absolutely no problem killing these mobs. Most of the time they hardly hit me once since I can keep them stunned almost throughout the entire fight. I was able to move pretty quickly through them and the respawn on these are pretty good. I just did circle around the ruins where they are located. I believe it is called the Legashi Encampment.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dont know if I was just lucky or what but I am working on gettin my rep with Darn up and in order to do that I need runecloth. So me and a friend of mine grind in two spots in Azshara and one spot in Felwood. I get all the runecloth and she gets all the Felcloth that drops. After about 1.5-2 hrs of grinding she walks home happy with about 8-10 pieces of the Felcloth and I am stacked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I farmed the Jadefire Demons for about an hour and got zip. Is this just my bad luck or do we have to go elsewhere?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Felcloth drops from demons, and Mooncloth are made from Felcloth. All other cloth drops from humanoids.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I find that the best place for farming these is in Azshara. There is a high population of foreign-speaking farmers, but there are usually enough mobs to accommodate all. There are three popular camps in the NE area of the map. Of course, the farmers cannot be dealt with because I am on a PVE server, so it may be different on PVPs.<br /><br />After killing tons of Legashi Satyrs(satrys, rogues, hellcallers), I have seen a drop rate of somewhere around 1/15. Of course, this is tempered by lots of runecloth, green drops, coin, and the occasional recipe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Gained 55000xp while farming for it in the Legish camp in Azshara, I gave up on it and went to buy it on AH instead. There were 2 level 70 hunter gold farms there though so they might have been the lucky one to get them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So this item can only be dropped even though tons are needed for tailoring</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is there an easy way to kill these things? I've tried soloing these but the only class I could see that can easily kill them is a priest, hunter, or paladin. I tried warrior and died pretty quickly =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I grinded the Jadefire Run Satyrs (Hellcallers, Tricksters, and Shadowstalkers because I found that they drop it the most), and I only grinded for 3 hours. In the end I recieved around 7.5G, 5 stacks of Felcloth, and 12 Star Rubies (from pickpocketing &lt;3). Really fun pwning the Allies while I was there too xD.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 31st 2006 5:43pm by PhantomAssassin</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bad drop rate doesn't begin to sum it up. I cleared all three camps in Azshara, then cleared them again for good measure. No one else was around at all. And not one single piece of felcloth dropped for me! I didn't even get any good green drops.<br /><br />I'll try again today and hope for the best.<br /><br />Ydain - 64 feral druid<br />Rexxar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>those drop nicely from both jadefire satyrs in felwood, and satyrs in azshara, however I'm 60 now and I've been bored of farming those...and I'm looking for another good spot with demons that drop them, but have a higher level than those satyrs, and so far the only ones are either elite, or really bad spawn rate without any other good drops. So I guess I'm forced to stick to the satyrs, unless someone knows a good higher level place (54+) to girnd them and would like to share it with us.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>60 lock just pwns em lol, 3 instant cast curses on each of them and all will die... Too few of them and too big respawn time for me ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tried it and it worked pretty well. Easy felcloth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Jadefire Run seems to be the best choice, seems like it, even though the drop rate is pretty abysmal. If your server isn't lousy with farmers I suggest going there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>All I seem to do is farm these things...<br /><br />Felwood: Problem is everyone farms here. If I do go here, I SW:P all I see, They chase me, and they die. If there are too many people, I go to the boss camp and wait. The spawn rate is fast enough that I can get them all before anyone else. Once they are dead, I drink mana and wait. If there is no competition, I simply run in a pattern with my DoT. <br /><br />Azshara: Down by the Naga's Beach behind the Timbermaws by the Bloodelves. <br />Run a pattern DoTing everything. The gold farming hunters can't keep up and usually leave. I always try to strike up a conversation with anyone who is farming the same stuff I am. If they don't reply or seem like a gold farmer then I am brutal in taking every mob I can. If not. I tone down and share the wealth. <br /><br />I also never buy the stuff. I don't like having to compete with people who are trying to make gold, when I need this stuff to make mooncloth. If you want to sell felcloth for gold, go ahead....I aint buying it. Nor should any self-respecting tailor. <br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 11th 2007 5:33pm by barkingpog</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 11th 2007 5:35pm by barkingpog</i></div>
