Let the tree aggro everything. You might want to clear the area first. The stuff he walks into isn't so bad, but if you end up with a couple other things beating on you, you're in trouble (especially if he starts walking because you aggrod some mobs instead of him).\n\n2) The range you have to keep is pretty tight. Don't let him wander very far from you or you'll get \"quest failed\". Seemed even more strict than other escort quests I have done but maybe that because he's huge and the scale is deceptive.\n\n3) He can't so much damage, but he can tank a mob for a bit. Any damage you do (including from SW:Pain) is going to draw you the aggro so you might as well just pick one and blast away while he holds the rest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was worried about this quest. Thought I might need a group. But gave it a shot because I was there. It was easy. As a priest level 55, I kept the npc (walking tree) healed and he did the fighting for me. I had him as my target and I stayed just behind him but kept on the green circle around his feet (by doing this the mobs attacked him and not me). It is worth trying :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What do you do with this thing? Is it useless and tossable?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The totally changed the walk.. No longer do you have to bring him to the south border of fereles. You walk around the lake now and walk to the north part of the path...<br /><br />Also, he is pvp marked so you can fight horde if they try to gank you.<br /><br />Also you don't get jumped by demons, you get hit by 3 irontree's and thats it.<br /><br />Completed solo<br /><br />Took 5 mins to complete..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Solo'ed as a 51 druid, here's how:<br /><br />Step one, follow above coords to the area it tells you to play the flute. Keep a look out in the area surrounding the cemetary there because he appears slightly outside of the ruins.<br /><br />Talk to him, then follow him.<br /><br />He goes north, most you'll get in terms adds is 3 in which case let him tank 2 and take one out. He's pretty good and self-heals after battles.<br /><br />I even died once, ran back to where he was, he was still tanking and I just picked up right where I left off.<br /><br />You just take him to the road, once you're there, he starts to feel better, you talk to him, quest is completed, and you just leave him there. Go to Forest Song (coords above are correct, remember, it's in Ashenvale).<br /><br />Claim it. I got 7300 xp and 150 rep with Darnassus + the reward item. I'm a happy camper. Enjoy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is amazingly easy now :) Just try and keep up with the guy and let him do most of the Tanking (Boy can he take a lotta damage!) My main advice is this, not all of the irontree stompers will attack him althoguh they will certainly attack you, But if you aggro them before he passes them then he will help kill them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Fairly decent quest...I, fortunately did NOT have any Horde interferance.&nbsp; Took me about 3 times to complete (54 Warlock w/VW).&nbsp; Banish a TON.&nbsp; Barely made it but for some reason, I was hellbent on soloing it (I don't know why).&nbsp; Would be a TON easier with help.&nbsp; My next alt will get help on this.<br /><br />But here is the question of the hour.<br /><br />WHAT did you all do with the Flute now that is is over ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just needed to follow him to the road then he said &quot;thank you&quot; and the quest was completed. did it at lvl 52. really easy :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just follow Arei to the road, kill some mobs on the way and the quest is completed. The quest is not repeatable so you can throw away the Flute of the ancients after the quest is finished.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You don't have to go anywhere neat Ashenvale to complete this quest. After you leave the ruins, he takes you on a path out to the road and that is where the quest is completed. We had to kill about 10 or so Irontree Stompers and a few Toxic Horrors and 1 bear. Very easy! 10 minutes or so to complete. 7300 exp and even better for a gnome, 150 darnassus rep! If you are going for a tiger mount that is! Have fun!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can see the temptation is very high for a horde player to go after a protector standing out in the open like that.<br /><br />I did it around 5am in the morning and fortunately there was hardely anyone around.<br /><br />Also the wandering monsters were not so bad.<br /><br />I was able to solo it with a 60 hunter mostly being able to kill quick enough before Arei's health gets too low.&nbsp; Also after combat he quickly regenerates.<br /><br />Basically you circle around the toxic lake fight about 3 toxic horrors then at the last part when you hit the road fight 4 Irontree Stompers.<br /><br />After that you are done!&nbsp; Quickly talk to Arei to complete the quest.<br /><br />Arie is standing dead in the middle of the road so now you can see why its a sitting target.<br /><br />One critical point of note:&nbsp; Stay close!&nbsp; I was healing my pet to scrub off the poisons when I got the failed quest.&nbsp; Grrr, the distance to stay with Arei is pretty short.<br /><br />Fortunately you can abandon the quest and use the flute again to restart the quest.<br /><br />Good luck you guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The mobs are a joke, since the spirit can handle them alone. Lv52 things against a huge lv5x (I don't remember now) that could hardly take half of his HP. If you're a healer class, you can complete it at lv40 just by standing back and letting the big guy fight, healing it if needed (what won't happen til the ambush, since he'll fight one by one).<br /><br />It's the 2nd easiest escorting quest I did so far (the first one was at Un'Goro), I can't see how to have problem with it.<br /><br />The real problem here is about getting ganked by the opposite faction. I was lucky, when the spirit reached the road a lv60 horde priest came by and just stood there, watching.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For all you people above that are not understanding the quest, it's very simple. Just go to the Irontree Woods and hit the spot 49,30. There, you should see a statue of some guy with a sword or something. There, use your flute like 5x in a row and look behind you. The guy will be there, trust me. Talk to him and just start following him. Warning though, he is flagged, and he's a ^&amp;*!@. He can't deal damage worth &amp;*!@. So, just follow him and beat up everything while keeping an eye out for the Horde. Had some hunter decide to attack him and I smoked his ass, so they will attack on sight. Real easy quest though, for a feral druid, much much cake. <br /><br />It's also a great way to smite the Horde while collecting Savage Frond for AD rep. Just keep the flute and go over there and summon the guy and start killing the other treants. When you see <i>Irontree Woods is under attack!</i> just run over there and kick whatever's ass. There should be a few Alliance people running around, and just let them know about the Hordie.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whats funny is if you go back to the ruins, you can blow the flute and summon him again.&nbsp; But when you talk to him he won't give you the quest.&nbsp; Sucks whenever you get left over baggage you have to check the site to see if you can toss items.&nbsp; All well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was a pretty easy solo for me as a 55 priest, but a couple of tips:<br /><br />1) Watch out for adds that you aggro by wandering around. Let the tree aggro everything. You might want to clear the area first. The stuff he walks into isn't so bad, but if you end up with a couple other things beating on you, you're in trouble (especially if he starts walking because you aggrod some mobs instead of him).<br /><br />2) The range you have to keep is pretty tight. Don't let him wander very far from you or you'll get &quot;quest failed&quot;. Seemed even more strict than other escort quests I have done but maybe that because he's huge and the scale is deceptive.<br /><br />3) He can't so much damage, but he can tank a mob for a bit. Any damage you do (including from SW:Pain) is going to draw you the aggro so you might as well just pick one and blast away while he holds the rest. Slap a Renew on him just before the fight to keep his health up, and after each fight if he's injured. You can also buff him, do this after you have summoned him and before you accept the quest from him.<br /><br />4) Keep your mana up by having waters/dews ready and drink them immediately after a fight. Again, be very careful about letting him get too far away.<br /><br />5) When you turn in the quest, the FP in Azshara is the closest if you are Alliance, and if you don't have it yet, get it when you do the turnin because it's right over the zone border (bridge).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The follow up quest you'll receive by whistling the flute is <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4261">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4261/ancient-spirit</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sure, the Spirit takes on lots of mobs and doesn't take a lot of damage, but he doesn't dole out much damage either. My 52 Warlock had to do 90% of the killing in each case. Since the Spirit doesn't do much damage, he also doesn't hold aggro, so you'll end up taking on 56 Protectors and teams of 54 Toxic Horrors.<br /><br />Because the Spirit takes up a lot of the screen (a BIG fellow), you can't always see what's coming from where; he screens a lot. I don't mean that it cannot be done; just that you can't tag along and watch, because some of the mobs (just LOVE those Toxic Horrors) will ignore the big guy and go right for your throat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Pretty easy, summon him at 51, 30. When he starts walking, just let him get aggro so he won't run off when u r fighting a mob. Watch out for those Toxic buttholes, they can stack poison like 20 nature dmg every 3 sec and then they can poison u with several 100 dmg per 5 sec, dotted my warrior to death. But luckily, the place I died (right after the first Toxic Horros) were not far from where I died, so I quickly catched Arei again. So watch out, get out of range when they cast that filthy poison. They CAN kill u if u get too many on u. After that, it was pretty simple. We catched the road and 3 lvl 53's spawned and began attacking him. Considered if I should use my 30 min CD, but we ganked them without. Pretty easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This was VERY EASY. Had a Lvl 54 horde hunter try something, so i let him think i wasnt around for awhile, then i Judged him and me and the Ancient proceeded to pwn him and his stupid bear. Just stick close to the Ancient and you'll be fine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The quest is only one party at a time, so if the big tree, Arei, doesn't show up, wait a few minutes and try again. As soon as the previous party is done or has failed, Arei will be available to summon. The quest is called Ancient Spirit. <a href="/classic/quest=4261/ancient-spirit">Ancient Spirit</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This leads to an escort quest of Arai a really large Tree.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Did it as a level 57 Paladin. Real easy. Arei will tank most of the mobs he walks by (if you let him), and you can heal/buff him if you need to. You only have to walk him through the random mobs onto the road, where an 'ambush' of 3 of those pesky treants will appear. After you kill those you're done.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>50,31 is the location, it's in the souther part of the Iron Tree Woods. When you use this flute you will summon a great tree and some smaller trees. The big tree, Arai, will give you an escort quest. The quest is really easy, you can't fail if you do it right. Just let the enemies hit HIM first. If you're a rogue, just stealth behind him. The only problem is that the tree is PvP marked, and since this is a popular grinding place they might kill him. A few times. Other than that, this quest is soloable at level 50 too I'm sure ;) Really easy quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The location is at 49,30 ... It's the statue with a spear ( also the place where spirit healer is at ) and after you use the flute, talk to big tree<br /><br />Edited, Sun May 8 14:40:10 2005</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
