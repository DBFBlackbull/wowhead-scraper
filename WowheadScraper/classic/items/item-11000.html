Comments\/corrections\/suggestions welcome. \n\n============ \n\nGetting To the Instance \n\nNOTE: You can pick up a LOT of quests for BRD from the little camp in Burning Steppes right near Redridge. \n\nTo get to Blackrock Mountain, go to Searing Gorge either from Loch Modan through the tunnel (if you have the Searing Gorge key) or running through Badlands. Enter the mountain in the southwesternish area (around 35,84 if you have Cosmos) -- there are wooden slats leading up a stone ramp. You'll see large iron doors, with one partially open. Welcome to the mountain. \n\nOnce you go in the door, there's an entrance on the right, which is the only way to go. You follow the path down and are in the central part of the mountain, with large chains going across the lava. \n\nIn order to get the quest for the shadowforge key, you need to die and travel as a ghost to the tomb in the central pillar. To do this, first you need to know that there's a ramp up out of the lava right near the doorway you came in from. There's a pillar just to the right near the archway that is close to it. To kill yourself, you want to jump down as near to that ramp as you can, so when you resurrect you don't keep dying. \n\nSo, jump on in. \n\nOK so run back to the mountain from the graveyard. Now when you come in don't resurrect, turn left and head toward that huge chain that goes across the lava. Run up the rock ramp to the chain and go across it to the central platform. Take the first door on the right, and then the next door on the right which is kind of kiddy corner. Go around the corner and you should see the ghost NPC standing on the tomb. Talk to him and get the quest. There's a door in the back left corner, go through it and follow the path down to a ramp by the lava. It ends at another chain that leads down to near where you jumped into the lava (hopefully). Rez on the ramp (which is on the right of where you came down the chain). \n\nNow go up the ramp, back to the chain, and head left. You should see a door at the top of a small set of stairs. Stop at the top of those stairs and turn right, there's another door there. Go in it, and follow it down. Congrats, you just took the shortcut to get into the instance. \n\nYou want to go left along that wall for a little bit, but there's a center path you can see up ahead. Head that way, and on the right is another quest NPC Overmaster Pyron who is part of the quest [url]www.wowhead.com\/classic\/quest=1206\/jarl-needs-eyes[\/url]. If you can, finish this, turn it in and get the follow up which is inside. \n\nThe door should be just ahead on the right. \n\nWelcome to Blackrock Depths. \n\nGuide to the Instance \n\nOnce you're inside, you can see a gate to your left, a path in front of you, and a dead end to your right. Buff up, it's game time. \n\nHead straight. There are going to be a couple on the way up, and a couple sets of roamers to deal with here. Once the way is clear, you want to take a right. There are groups along the walls and some roamers along here as well, usually you can take the groups alone without getting the second on engaged. Clear your way up, these are the Halls of Law. \n\nAs you are going up, there will be a room to your left with a few elites in it and High Interrogator Gerstahn. You want to kill this NPC to get the Prison Cell Key which is used in quests later. FIRST clear the things that are across the hall from the door if you can, the Interrogator casts fear and you might end up running into them. It drops one bind on pickup key, so you'll have to roll for it. \n\nTake your first right into the Detention Block, and go into the Ring of Law. A NPC will spawn, a dwarf in robes (Name I can't recall) that start shouting. Ignore him, you can't kill him, but he summons a wave of monsters from the door on the right. Try to keep your casters away as much as you can, occasionally bats spawn and they cast silence. Once you kill this wave the door to the north (straight ahead from the door you came in) will open with a boss-ish mob. Med in between if you can. \n\nAfter this, go through the left door up the ramp which is the East Garrison. Stop at the top of the ramp! There are mobs nearby that you don't want to aggro if you can avoid it. There's usually a fire elemental type walker and a handful of dark dwarves to kill. Once they are down you want to take a very hard right, the door you want to go through is right next to the one you came up. You will be above where you just fought, in the upper part of the Ring of Law again. Don't talk to the spectators, they will aggro and you'll have a mess on your hands. Head left, and take the door over there. \n\nSo down the ramp is a cluster of 5-7 guys and there is a fire elemental walker. There's usually a couple of casters in the group, so while your tank is on one of the fights, the damage dealers might want to take them out first. Try not to let them run to the right, there's another group over there. Pulling them up the ramp to fight on it is probably easiest. \n\nOnce they're clear, take a left. You'll be heading towards a bridge. There are two fire elementals on each end on either side of the doorway. \n\nWelcome to Shadowforge City. \n\nOn the other side of the bridge, pull the group in the room onto the bridge to keep them from aggroing the others in the room. Once cleared, hug the left wall and go into another sub room. This is usually a group of 5-7, usually with a healer and a caster. \n\nYou'll turn the corner and straight ahead of you see a doorway. Head through that and there's a group right there. [NOTE: You can see Lord Incendious from up here. Don't jump down to Incendious, you'll be there in a second.] As you continue around the circle, there's a group by a door on the right. It looks like you can pull just the two by the door, but you can't, the whole group is linked. You want to go through the second door on the right, and if you hug the wall you can usually avoid dealing with the group at the end of the circle. \n\nOnce through the doorway, there are a couple of golems and dwarves to fight. This is the area where you kill the named dwarf, Fineous Darkvire level 53\/54 elite, for Ironfel to get the Shadowforge key. He wanders around, so you can likely stay at the top of that ramp down for him to come to you. He hits like a truck, so this is a pretty tough fight. \n\nLoot him for Ironfel. Gratz. \n\nIf you keep going down the ramp through the golems, you'll run into Lord Incendious (and the black anvil for you armor\/weaponsmiths). Kill him for that quest. \n\nNow go back the way you came, to that ramp down from the circle (Ring of Law, upper part). You want to take the right from that ramp, which should be straight ahead from where you're facing now. Take out the group on the corner, usually 5-7 (detect a trend?) with a couple of casters. \n\nAround the corner, at the end of the hall, is a statue with a few mobs in front of it. Occasionally there is a named monster that drops a flame weapon enchant amongst other things. Wipe them out and put Ironfel into the statue. \n\nCongratulations, you now have the Shadowforge Key.","date":"2006-02-09T07:50:03-06:00","rating":162,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"For those of you who get lost after obtaining Ironfel, the place you are looking for you have not been to yet.

Buff up, it's game time. <br /><br />Head straight. There are going to be a couple on the way up, and a couple sets of roamers to deal with here. Once the way is clear, you want to take a right. There are groups along the walls and some roamers along here as well, usually you can take the groups alone without getting the second on engaged. Clear your way up, these are the Halls of Law. <br /><br />As you are going up, there will be a room to your left with a few elites in it and High Interrogator Gerstahn. You want to kill this NPC to get the Prison Cell Key which is used in quests later. FIRST clear the things that are across the hall from the door if you can, the Interrogator casts fear and you might end up running into them. It drops one bind on pickup key, so you'll have to roll for it. <br /><br />Take your first right into the Detention Block, and go into the Ring of Law. A NPC will spawn, a dwarf in robes (Name I can't recall) that start shouting. Ignore him, you can't kill him, but he summons a wave of monsters from the door on the right. Try to keep your casters away as much as you can, occasionally bats spawn and they cast silence. Once you kill this wave the door to the north (straight ahead from the door you came in) will open with a boss-ish mob. Med in between if you can. <br /><br />After this, go through the left door up the ramp which is the East Garrison. Stop at the top of the ramp! There are mobs nearby that you don't want to aggro if you can avoid it. There's usually a fire elemental type walker and a handful of dark dwarves to kill. Once they are down you want to take a very hard right, the door you want to go through is right next to the one you came up. You will be above where you just fought, in the upper part of the Ring of Law again. Don't talk to the spectators, they will aggro and you'll have a mess on your hands. Head left, and take the door over there. <br /><br />So down the ramp is a cluster of 5-7 guys and there is a fire elemental walker. There's usually a couple of casters in the group, so while your tank is on one of the fights, the damage dealers might want to take them out first. Try not to let them run to the right, there's another group over there. Pulling them up the ramp to fight on it is probably easiest. <br /><br />Once they're clear, take a left. You'll be heading towards a bridge. There are two fire elementals on each end on either side of the doorway. <br /><br />Welcome to Shadowforge City. <br /><br />On the other side of the bridge, pull the group in the room onto the bridge to keep them from aggroing the others in the room. Once cleared, hug the left wall and go into another sub room. This is usually a group of 5-7, usually with a healer and a caster. <br /><br />You'll turn the corner and straight ahead of you see a doorway. Head through that and there's a group right there. As you continue around the circle, there's a group by a door on the right. It looks like you can pull just the two by the door, but you can't, the whole group is linked. You want to go through the second door on the right, and if you hug the wall you can usually avoid dealing with the group at the end of the circle. <br /><br />Once through the doorway, there are a couple of golems and dwarves to fight. This is the area where you kill the named dwarf, Fineous Darkvire level 53/54 elite, for Ironfel to get the Shadowforge key. He wanders around, so you can likely stay at the top of that ramp down for him to come to you. He hits like a truck, so this is a pretty tough fight. <br /><br />Loot him for Ironfel. Gratz. <br /><br />If you keep going down the ramp through the golems, you'll run into Lord Incendious (and the black anvil for you armor/weaponsmiths). Kill him for that quest. <br /><br />Now go back the way you came, to that ramp down from the circle (Ring of Law, upper part). You want to take the right from that ramp, which should be straight ahead from where you're facing now. Take out the group on the corner, usually 5-7 (detect a trend?) with a couple of casters. <br /><br />Around the corner, at the end of the hall, is a statue with a few mobs in front of it. Occasionally there is a named monster that drops a flame weapon enchant amongst other things. Wipe them out and put Ironfel into the statue. <br /><br />Congratulations, you now have the Shadowforge Key.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alphasigmasigma</b></h3>According to Josh Greenfield in the interview at <a href="https://screenrant.com/world-warcraft-classic-hardcore-interview-challenge-level/" rel="nofollow">https://screenrant.com/world-warcraft-classic-hardcore-interview-challenge-level/</a> it is possible to get the Shadowforge Key in Hardcore: <div class="quote-box">Yeah, there's a couple of things like the Videre elixir quest, where you have to drink the potion in Tanaris graveyard, and it kills you, so you can talk to the dead person. We've retooled that so it doesn't quite kill you, it like reduces you to low health. So, it's a little dangerous, but it's not a guaranteed death, and you can still progress that. There's a few other situations like that, like the Shadowforge Key in BRD, that's one that we have a kind of cheeky workaround for as well that players can discover.</div><br /><br />I look forward to seeing what this &quot;cheeky workaround&quot; is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rtemisia</b></h3>I tried this in 2023. I jumped into the core, died, and rezzed right next to Franclorn Forgewright in his tomb with a Spirit Healer to my left. He didn't give me the quest - only the talking.
