Well.. Make a friend with a level 60..or if you already have a 60 friend..then GREAT!...(Or you could pay a person to do this for you) Get your friend (or paid friend) to do the Libram quest..have him gather all the items.. give him the 30 gold required to combine the items for the quest and have him complete the quest... Now...&nbsp; just like any other enchant... trade with your friend and put your item in the 'will not be traded' slot and your friend will be able to use the enchant on your item! <br /><br />Hope this helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are a number of other books found around the world. They are &quot;lost texts&quot; of the Quel'Thalas High Elves? There are two NPCs that &quot;collect&quot; these when you find them. <br /><br />One NPC, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=9836"><u>Mathredis Firestar</u></a>, is found in Flame Crest in The Burning Steppes. <br />He only accepts Librams of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4481"><u>Constitution</u></a> (100HP), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4483"><u>Resilience</u></a> (20FireResist), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4463"><u>Rumination</u></a> (100mana), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4482"><u>Tenacity</u></a> (125armor), and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4484"><u>Voracity</u></a> (+8 to any stat). <br /><br />The other NPC, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14368"><u>Lorekeeper Lydros</u></a>, can be found in the Library in the <b>Dire Maul</b> instance (North entrance). <br />He accepts Librams of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7484"><u>Focus</u></a> (+8 healing&amp;spelldmg), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7485"><u>Protection</u></a> (1%dodge), and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7483"><u>Rapidity</u></a> (1% haste).<br /><br />Each of these enchants can <b>only</b> be applied to a <u>Head</u> or <u>Leg</u> item. Normal enchants provided by Enchanters cannot enchant Head or Legs, thus making these types of enchants that much more valuable!<br /><br />Each Libram is Unique so you can only carry one at a time. After finding said Librams and taking them to said NPC, the NPC will tell you what items you need to obtain the enchantment each book provides. For more information on how to obtain each of the components requried for the turn-in, click on the link I provided for each book to read about the quest associated with it. <br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 3rd 2006 11:23am by justadakaje</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 3rd 2006 11:27am by justadakaje</i></div>
