Even a warrior would recieve some benefit from SPI, though very little. Hunters would have more benefit from SPI because not only are they regenerating HP they're regenerating mana. Warlocks try to avoid SPI and go for STA or INT, which makes sence because Spirit Tap and Life Tap is a wonderful setup. I'm not saying SPI isn't a good stat for a warlock, but the other casters can benefit from it more then warlocks. Shaman have the ability to both regen their own mana and regen their own health, reducing the benefit of SPI realitive to other classes. Mages and shaman both have abilities they can use regularly to increase their mana, but mages must be out of cambat and sitting to recieve their regen bonus. Mages can also recieve 15% added bonus to mana regeneratoin during combat, and gain 1500% regen bonus with proper talents. With the proper setup mages can benifet more from SPI then shaman do. Priests and *some* druids only means of mana regen is SPI and can also heal themselves reducing some of the use for HP regen. Druids and priests also can recieve the 15% mana regeneration during combat through talents. But, through talents a druid can recieve 100% mana regenration during combat plus 400% average mana regeneration making the benefit of SPI very valuable to druids.\n\nWho is would benefit the most from the DPS?\n\nWarrios and hunters would obviously benefit the most from a 58 DPS weapon but, shaman and druids can recieve spell enchanments for their weapons, (either from spells or talens) often use equipment that with STR on it, and do use melee weapons for *melee*. Other caster classes most often avoid melee and often would rather use a wand more often then a staff because of their total lack of STR.","date":"2005-04-13T19:35:45-05:00","rating":5,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Gues","importedSubject":"A breakdown for the hard headed.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3639</b></h3>Most would say that this weapon is ideally suited to Warlocks, due to it's +Stamina. But it is suited for any class that is capable of holding staves. High dps and stamina buff is good for elemental Shamans. Spirit and Stamina good for Mages and Priests. And the Intellect buff would be welcomed by all.<br /><br />An ace looking weapon too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>604</b></h3>Hello!<br /><br />I do have a question about this item. Does the buff given from it fade after death? I see that the Headmaster's Charge's buff has a 10 minute cooldown. It would seem that unless I am either incorrect or the cooldown resets after death, you would be short quite a few int points. I can imagine this being a horrible pain in the Battlegrounds....<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3639</b></h3>Hey Malgrumm, unfortunately the buff does disappear upon death, and you have to wait for the cooldown timer before rebuffing.<br /><br />But hey, it's only 10 minutes max that you have to wait :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>598</b></h3>this staff amkes for an excelent warlock weapon because of it high stamina. slap a +30 spellpower enchant on it and you will be good to go for a while. The Intelect buff lasts for fifteen minutes total and has a cooldown of 10 minutes so it is a bit of a pain to keep an eye on but dont worry the mana users in your party will be sure to remind you if you ever forget to rebuff it =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6934</b></h3>I picked this up as a druid(pre MC) shortly after it was added to the game. It was a nice support staff for beginner raiders, especially for caster/healer groups in MC, ZG, etc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7700</b></h3>This weapon should automatically be defaulted to a warlock. The intellect buff increase pet's intellect, but even more over comes with 30 stamina which is essential to any warlock's arsenal. This staff looks amazing. Int+ buff benefits all nearby group members.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6861</b></h3>&quot;A Mage does not need stamina, they only need int and +damage gear so they can nuke harder&quot; -- magmy. im sorry magmy, but have you played a mage? we die unbelieveably fast because of lack of stamina, im a lvl 60 mage and have about 3k hp. there are 60 warlocks that have 4.5k hp running around and you say this should go to a warlock for the stam? i dont think so. this is an excellent staff for ANY caster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7773</b></h3>This staff dropped for me last night alone with the hand cannon it was awarded to a druid who was using HWL staff. My shaman only has the staff of magefire, needless to say i was upset. This staff is sweet and definitely good for many classes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7798</b></h3>I have this staff on my Warlock alt, and it's fantastic. Fairly easy to get, drops off Darkmaster Gandling in Scholomance. The stats are buff are absolutely amazing in any group. It also buffs my pets Intelligence so it is very useful for a Warlock. <br /><br />One downside is when you have the buff on and die, you don't rez with the buff and cooldown doesn't restart. Besides that, excellent weapon for pre-MC and BWL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Athryl</b></h3>The staff is great for any caster. I had it on my warlock for a long time but I would not have been upset had the priest, mage, or druid in my group rolled for it because it works well for all of us. I get a slight bonus for having demonic embrace to make stamina worth a bit more than other classes. Raiding guilds love having this staff and everyone was sad the day I replaced it with a higher DPS staff. By putting +30 spell power on it it made a great all around staff for my lock while doing MC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5094</b></h3>Disenchanted into 2 x Nexus Crystal.<br /><br />This staff is good because of the huge amount of stamina, and therefore should go to a warlock. A mage would prefer a staff with intellect.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PrimEviL</b></h3>but, this staff also gives +20spirit(useless for lock) and +20int(circumstational). just the point that it gives high stamina it never should be more of a lock item. personaly, i preffer high +spelldmg gear over high stat gear(i'm pve oriented) for my mage, but a stat-oriented mage should never be judged for rolling need side by side with warlock for this staff.</div>

Stop trying to justify that your class could use it better in a vain attempt to greedily be able to claim it yourself, or justify that if you loose it, it was because you were 'screwed over' Let good old fate decide by rolling it off, if you loose, don't #$%^&amp;, take it like a man. :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yah the dude above is right, im a shaman its good on me, its good on casters, druids etc. The point of glowing brightwood staff is better on casters would point to druids and shamans because it is more &quot;end game&quot; but the fact is it rocks on both. As for my shaman, do i want it? hell yeah, but id say given the choice i could settle for something in that range with alot slower attack speed. Also glowing brightwood staff is alot easier, this is like less then 1% drop, 0 have dropped on frostwolf that i know of and at least 20 of the brightwood staffs have. : /</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Who WOULDN'T benefit from increased mana and HP regen?<br /><br />No one. Even a warrior would recieve some benefit from SPI, though very little. Hunters would have more benefit from SPI because not only are they regenerating HP they're regenerating mana. Warlocks try to avoid SPI and go for STA or INT, which makes sence because Spirit Tap and Life Tap is a wonderful setup. I'm not saying SPI isn't a good stat for a warlock, but the other casters can benefit from it more then warlocks. Shaman have the ability to both regen their own mana and regen their own health, reducing the benefit of SPI realitive to other classes. Mages and shaman both have abilities they can use regularly to increase their mana, but mages must be out of cambat and sitting to recieve their regen bonus. Mages can also recieve 15% added bonus to mana regeneratoin during combat, and gain 1500% regen bonus with proper talents. With the proper setup mages can benifet more from SPI then shaman do. Priests and *some* druids only means of mana regen is SPI and can also heal themselves reducing some of the use for HP regen. Druids and priests also can recieve the 15% mana regeneration during combat through talents. But, through talents a druid can recieve 100% mana regenration during combat plus 400% average mana regeneration making the benefit of SPI very valuable to druids.<br /><br />Who is would benefit the most from the DPS?<br /><br />Warrios and hunters would obviously benefit the most from a 58 DPS weapon but, shaman and druids can recieve spell enchanments for their weapons, (either from spells or talens) often use equipment that with STR on it, and do use melee weapons for *melee*. Other caster classes most often avoid melee and often would rather use a wand more often then a staff because of their total lack of STR.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its not specifically for any class. Warlocks say its for warlocks. Shammys say its for Shammys.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this on my warlock last night. I've been wanting it for ages, more for the cool graphic than anything else though. The party intel buff is pretty nice; I could see it working particularly well with a caster group that contains a moonkin druid. Extra intel + the crit aura is all good.<br /><br />As for which class can best use this staff; all casters can undoubtedly use it. The stamina is the main bone of contention here: many warlock builds are very stamina heavy because of our reliance on lifetap. Stamina = mana to warlocks, the more HP we have, the bigger our effective mana pool becomes. While stamina is obviously a valuable asset to all casters in PvP particularly, warlocks will probably utilise the increased stamina more routinely in both PvP and PvE raiding. <br /><br />Just my .02c, but any caster will enjoy this staff and be a popular group addition.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is good for any caster, if I was a mage/druid/priest and i was using a blue or green I would definitely roll against a warlock for this. The stats benifit every casting class. Every caster needs Stamina and Intel. The worst part is that everyone debates about this weapon soooo frigging much but it barely drops. Same deal in ZG PuGs when it comes to bosses that drop mounts.</div>

The priest and myself rolled on this staff... I won the roll there. I told our party of all guild mates that I was still using the helm that I got from the Maraudon Princess. The priest just let me have that helm as well. I really hated to receive all the loot from &quot;Darkmaster Gandling&quot; but it is for improving the guild. right?<br /><br />One question I had was the on use, it says all party members in 30 yard radius. What about other groups in the entire raid. Do they get it as well? From other posts that are saying, &quot;I am the most favorite raid member&quot;. it sounds like it is a raid wide buff.

Im not so sure a Mage would really dig this if they alrdy had argent crusader/trindle, etc., but that just depends. Im a priest using the Argent crusader with +20 Spirit enchant, but wow, this staff is so amazingly uber. In the hands of a priest, it is just amazing.<br />30 Stam<br />40Spir<br />30 Int (using staff buff)<br /><br />cant argue with that. Oh and btw, shaman's cna go $%^&amp; themselves. Every shaman i've grouped with had to server some DPS purpose, and using a staff isnt how u'd go about doing that.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The reason everybody is so crazy about this is that it is dropping with such a friggin small percentage. And that, without ANY doubt, makes it a warlock staff. We know Blizzard hates Warlocks which is why this staff has this crappy droprate.<br /><br />I will go on &quot;farming&quot; (as if you could farm that...) this staff but in the end I know what will happen: I will get friggin mad at Blizzard for the droprate on this, make one or two runs to MC and get me the staff of dominance. Okay, that is (in my eyes) a mage staff but at least that's an epic staff that I know I have a chance to get.<br />The droprate on the headmaster's charge really pisses me off... :|<br /><br />I totally don't want it to be so high that everyone is having this - I just want a realistic chance to get it...1% or close to 1% dropchance would be totally fine. :(</div>

He got super pissed and called us all noobs haha what an idiot he spammed noob noob noob while doing /point then he knew we were going to kick him so he ran in the room and aggro’d it the guy couldn’t give me a reason why lock&gt;druid hmm… he goes “if you weren’t a noob you’d know why” what a fool</div>

Ok say i had this-100%health 5% mana. Use life tap. With the extra health you gain extra mana if you have enough for the life tap requirements, so in the end you might have 100%mana 15% health depending on how much health you have then you use HS,bandage,death coil,drain life. Use HS or bandage(when not being attacked) then you have 100% everything while your in combat so you can keep busting ass. So the more stamina does equal health but it also means more mana for us locks...<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jun 5 00:29:54 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>shaman are the only class that will utilize the high dps of the weapon. the dps is the weapon's most outstanding stat. the other stats are ok, but can be gotten from other gear. you can only get 58.4 dps on a weapon. shaman have to take a talent to use two-handed weapons except staves, making this a great DPS weapon that resto shaman could use.<br /><br />casters shouldn't be taking hits, so they don't need 30 stamina. a shaman in melee might be getting hit, so the stamina benefits them more than a caster.<br /><br />20 spirit is nice, but it also benefits a shaman in melee more than other classes. a shaman that's meleeing and being the backup healer will be out of a casting state more than your main healer or DPS casters.<br /><br />the intellect buff benefits everyone in your party. if a priest gets this staff, they may be in groups where they are the only mana user. one shaman usually can't handle all of the healing for a group, so a shaman is more likely to be grouped with other mana users which will maximize the effectiveness of this buff.<br /><br />not only do shaman benefit from each aspect of this weapon more than casters do, but there is nothing for shaman that this weapon is missing. when playing the role of the backup healer, shaman don't need a lot of +healing from gear. shaman already have big heals and will overheal a lot with no +healing. a backup healer doesn't need the biggest and best heals, they just need to fill in the gaps left by the main healer. while +spell crit would help a shaman, that just translates to more aggro and even more overhealing for a backup healer. for dps casters, this staff is very lacking in the damage department. and for a dps caster, that's the most important department.<br /><br />if you want to go purely by the benefits that each class gets from this weapon, its best for shaman. though its best for shaman, its not very good for them. its a fun weapon to have for the intellect buff, but its not a very good staff for anyone. the only time i'd use this staff is when i'm grinding, but with the number of scholo raids it would take to get one of these, you'd probably be 60 already.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Jun 2 12:23:26 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This staff definitely is NOT just for warlocks.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, it's got skulls, and yeah, it's got lots of Stamina. But that's precisely it. Mages have crud all health as it is, and 300 health is great to a mage, but only good for a warlock.<br /><br />I have a priest, mage and warlock (plus others), and I would roll on this for ANY of them if they needed it for an upgrade. And yes, my warlock is level 60, but I would not be upset about losing it to a mage or priest - a druid I would have to think about. Well, at least I wouldn't be upset because of class... I'd be pretty bummed for losing the roll though!<br /><br />Ok, but a hunter, warrior, etc? Cloth wearers are fairly limited with their choice of weapons, so I really think classes that have a much broader weapon choice should let the more limited classes go first.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Oct 12 09:09:11 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone who is'nt warlock and even thinks about rolling on this should REALLY think about what he is doing...<br /><br />Warlocks need ONE thing, stamina.<br />As a secondary stat, they need Intellect, Spell Damage, and some warlocks CRIT. Some HIT. Depending on your build.<br />There is NO other caster class that need stamina as much as a warlock. Heck, not even warriors makes more use of stamina.<br /><br />Druids does NOT need this, its insane!<br />Heres why:<br />If a druid in fact really needs stamina, its because he is playing a lot in bear form, thus making use of his &quot;20% more stamina in bearform&quot; talent.<br />Ok, well if a druid is playing a lot in bearform, he des NOT require a lot of spirit and intellect too! There are a lot of nice maces and even staffs out there that gives both strength and stamina!<br /><br />Like this:<br /><a href="/classic/item=19944/nat-pagles-fish-terminator">Nat Pagle's Fish Terminator</a> THAT is a druid fearal staff!<br /><br />There are 2 staffs in the game that gives you more stamina than this one...<br />1) Grand Marshal's Stave / High Warlord's War Staff<br />Rank 14 staff, yeah...<br />2) Blessed Qiraji Acolyte Staff<br />AQ Quest.<br /><br />I see no reason what so ever for any class to roll on this if there is a warlock in the group.<br /><br />Also, god damnit...

Just because you &quot;can&quot; use it, does'nt mean you have to ruin it for everyone else!<br />A warlock will probably never see a better staff than this, while you will easely get a better one later in game.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Mar 30 02:51:30 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does it say warlock only anywhere? - no. Mages are also after stamina/int, nubs. Priests can also make use of Int/Sta/Spi. <br /><br />Just because it looks freaky doesn't mean it belongs to warlocks. If this dropped for my mage or priest I would roll need, warlocks can go jump.<br /><br />It's quite difficult to get benediction, so if it was an upgrade for the priest the priest should roll.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>any warlock that would take this over <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20536">soul harvester</a> or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18534">rod of the ogre magi</a> is silly. any spell damage staff from a raid would be better than this staff too. weapons are a crucial slot for spell damage, so taking something with no spell damage is crippling.<br /><br />stamina is no better for warlocks than it is for any other class. lifetap does not convert stamina to mana, it converts health to mana. health is what's useful to warlocks. stamina is a good source of health, but not good enough.<br /><br />assuming you have these talents:<br />from 1 point of atamina, you effectively get 1.15 stamina.<br /><br />1.15 stamina gives you 11.5 hit points.<br /><br />lifetapping converts 1 health into 1.2 mana, so you'd convert 11.5 hit points into 13.8 mana.<br /><br />1 point of intellect gives you 15 mana. purely for mana, intellect comes out ahead.<br /><br />but like i said, health is what's useful to a warlock, not stamina. warlocks have many ways to get health: drain life, siphon life, healthstones, and demon armor.<br /><br />rank 6 of drain life steals 355 life and costs 300 mana. that's already efficient, but let's assume the warlock goes for +shadow damage instead of +stamina gear, and they have +190 shadow damage (+250 shadow damage is easily attainable from high level 5 man instances).<br /><br />+190 shadow damage has half effectiveness on life leeching spells, so you effectively get +95. since drain life is a single target spell done over time, you get that full +95 damage. drain life heals you for the amount of damage dealt, so now you're stealing 450 life at the cost of 300 mana.<br /><br />lifetap would convert 450 health into 540 mana. so you spent 300 mana to get 540 mana and end up with the same amount of health. that is why health is useful to a warlock, because you can use it to turn 300 mana into 540 mana by using health as an intermediate step. that had nothing to do with how much your max health is, or how much stamina you have. increasing your stamina will not make that conversion any more efficient, but increasing your bonus to shadow damage will.<br /><br />note: the conversion is already efficient with no +shadow damage and no talents to help. drain life gives you more health than it costs mana, and life tap is, at worst, a one-to-one conversion. the worst case for rank 6 of drain life would be spending 300 mana to get 355 mana. the bonus to shadow damage is just to show that stamina does not help it at all, but shadow damage does.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Apr 29 08:13:11 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On Alliance side I'd agree Warlocks 1st.<br /><br />On Horde side I'd be inclined to say that shamans and warlocks can fight for it.

No matter what kind of shaman you are or what you're doing, this is great.<br /><br />However, frankly, most people will never see it even if they do a hundred scholo runs so it hardly really matters.</div>

Enchant this baby with +9 Intellect, and with the +30 Intellect use, your looking at a <br /><br />+39 Intellect<br />+30 Stamina<br />+20 Spirit<br /><br />What kind of Mage WOULDNT like that? Warlocks and Druids arent the only classes that are looking for more Stamina anyway. I hate it when people think Mages shouldnt have any Stamina. If a Mage didnt have any Stamina they wouldnt be AOEing and it would screw them over REALLY badly, it would also screw the group over REALLY badly.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Say it with me: the aura applies to warlock pets.<br /><br />If this staff were simply 30 sta, 20 spi, 20 int, I would have no issue with any caster (or anyone who could use it) rolling. But it's not.<br /><br />To put it simply, the int aura is what makes this so godly for warlocks. Pet buffs are hard to come by (there are only 2 other items which buff warlock pets) and this gives a HUGE boost to mana. It would even justify putting points into fel intellect! So please consider this before rolling against a warlock for it (even if he's too dumb to realize this point and just wants it because it looks &quot;kewl&quot;).<br /><br />And in closing, the aura applies to warlock pets. :)</div>

Lifetap - converet HP to mana.. if we dont have much stam this ability will shoot our HP right down, restoring v little mana and making us vulnerable to die.<br />2. Health funnel - transfers health from the warlock to their demon minion, again, if the lock has low stam they cannot do this ability much and will become vulnerable by using it.<br /><br />Last off, why would we have talents in demonology &quot;demonic embrace&quot; increases stamina by 15% and decreses spirit by 5% (if all 5 TP used) &lt;-- would be a bit pointless to have that talent if stam was no use for locks.... i think i have made my point.<br /><br />(just to clarify though, i personally have no problem with mages/priests/druids rolling on this staff)</div>

When you switch weapon, also your buff gets removed.<br /><br />In short, RP weapon.
