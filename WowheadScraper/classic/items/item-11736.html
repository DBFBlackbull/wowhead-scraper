I''ve seen these offered between 40g & 180g. Personally I wouldn''t pay more than 75 at most. 150g is way too much, but these past few months I haven''t seen it less than 80g. You can farm DM for Libram books too, but you never know which Libram will drop.\n\n[b]1 Burning Essence[\/b] - This has nothing to do with the Heart of the Mountain quest where you need the Relic Coffer Keys.\n\nThis is a bop item from the Dark Coffer room in BRD. Rogues can solo this. I used to solo this fairly easy after many hours of practice, though I don't have Imp Sap or Prep anymore. Without a Rogue having Imp Sap this cannot be done solo or without at least a 4 man group(3 if you're badasses - stealthed or non-stealthed). I think you can do it in a raid, but after the 1.10 patch raiding in BRD will be a thing of the past. Anyway you get into the Coffer room, sap the guy closest to the painting, read the painting, & it tells you where the guy you need to kill is which can be in 1 of 6 spawn points usually not too far away(not always though). Kill the guy that spawns, loot the bop temporary key & unlock the Vault back in the Coffer room. About half the time you'll get a Burning Essence. If you don't have imp sap the whole coffer room must be cleared. \n\nAbout the 6 spawn points, only 3 are soloable. Ofgut spawns near General Angerforge which makes for a 6 elite mob fight so you need a good group for that one. The one that appears in the bar room is far away & too hard even for a 5man cause if you don't clear the surrounding mobs the whole room aggros. It's quicker & best to just reset instance & get a better spawn point. Those are the 2 that I'd recommend resetting. The other spawn points should be easy in a group. The spawn point inside the coffer room cannot be done solo either.\n\nThen once you have all the mats, take them to Flame Crest in Burning Steps & talk to the dude there & you can give him the mats [b]+ another 30g[\/b] for the Arcanum.","date":"2006-02-19T22:03:25-06:00","rating":81,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"It is actually possible to do this without imp sap, all depends on what lvl the guy who's closest to you is, if he's below 53, you can do it - I did manage to do it though, just hug the wall, and stretch after the picture","creationdate":"2006-05-03T22:03:25-05:00","id":1158040,"rating":1,"commentid":2645925,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Arcanes","importedSubject":"Possible without imp sap!"},{"body":"To get blue and yellow power crystals converted into the Crystal Spires you'll need to collect 10 Yellow Power Crystals and 10 Blue Power Crystals from Un'Goro Crater.\n\nFor those who have finished the quest line for the pylons and have the [b]Crystal Pylon User's Manual[\/b], the conversion is simple.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>20 to fire resistance</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here are all the different librams you can collect remember you can only have 1 book of the same type at once. Once you convert the book in the quest you can(theoretically) carry the same arcanum with you. The two letter abbreviations are BS and DM are for where the quest turn in is for that libram. BS = Burning Steppes DM = Dire Maul<br /><br />What each of the arcanum do: <br />Rumination&nbsp; - BS - 150 mana&nbsp; <br />Constitution - BS - 100 hp&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Tenacity&nbsp; &nbsp; - BS - 125 armor<br />Resilience&nbsp; - BS - +20 fire resistance<br />Voracity&nbsp; &nbsp; - BS - +8 str/agi/sta/int/spi (only 1 stat of the 5)<br />Rapidity&nbsp; &nbsp; - DM - +1% haste to attacks (ranged/melee)<br />Focus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - DM - +8 healing and damage from spells<br />Protection&nbsp; - DM - +1% to dodge</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You gather 10 yellow and 10 blue power crystals and turn them into the Eastern Pylon in Un'Goro Crater which gives you 6 Crystal Spires.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Most people dont know it works but it CAN be used in trade window like an enchant, I tried it today.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I picked it up in Tyr's Hand in EPL.<br />I would recommend not selling this since it's used for +20 Fire Resist.<br />(Molten Core ? yes plz !)<br />If you are selling it, it goes for around 130g on Skullcrusher.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here is what you need to get...<br /><br /><b>Lesser Arcanum of Resilience</b>(bop) - Adds +20 Fire Resist to a Head or Leg slot. (Can be used to enchant someone else''s item or your own, like an enchanter would) <br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=-160">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=-160</a> <br /><br />Requires: <br /><br /><b>1 Black Diamond</b> - Can mine from Dark Iron spots, drop from random BRD mobs, or from the AH around 20-40g each. <br /><br /><b>4 Crystal Spire</b> - Get 10 Yellow &amp; 10 Blue Power Crystals (around Ungoro or from AH cheap) &amp; go to the East Pylon in Ungoro. <br /><br /><b>1 Libram of Resilience</b> - Get from AH or from people selling in chat. I''ve seen these offered between 40g &amp; 180g. Personally I wouldn''t pay more than 75 at most. 150g is way too much, but these past few months I haven''t seen it less than 80g. You can farm DM for Libram books too, but you never know which Libram will drop.<br /><br /><b>1 Burning Essence</b> - This has nothing to do with the Heart of the Mountain quest where you need the Relic Coffer Keys.<br /><br />This is a bop item from the Dark Coffer room in BRD. Rogues can solo this. I used to solo this fairly easy after many hours of practice, though I don't have Imp Sap or Prep anymore. Without a Rogue having Imp Sap this cannot be done solo or without at least a 4 man group(3 if you're badasses - stealthed or non-stealthed). I think you can do it in a raid, but after the 1.10 patch raiding in BRD will be a thing of the past. Anyway you get into the Coffer room, sap the guy closest to the painting, read the painting, &amp; it tells you where the guy you need to kill is which can be in 1 of 6 spawn points usually not too far away(not always though). Kill the guy that spawns, loot the bop temporary key &amp; unlock the Vault back in the Coffer room. About half the time you'll get a Burning Essence. If you don't have imp sap the whole coffer room must be cleared. <br /><br />About the 6 spawn points, only 3 are soloable. Ofgut spawns near General Angerforge which makes for a 6 elite mob fight so you need a good group for that one. The one that appears in the bar room is far away &amp; too hard even for a 5man cause if you don't clear the surrounding mobs the whole room aggros. It's quicker &amp; best to just reset instance &amp; get a better spawn point. Those are the 2 that I'd recommend resetting. The other spawn points should be easy in a group. The spawn point inside the coffer room cannot be done solo either.<br /><br />Then once you have all the mats, take them to Flame Crest in Burning Steps &amp; talk to the dude there &amp; you can give him the mats <b>+ another 30g</b> for the Arcanum.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did a coffer run with 2 rogues.<br />No need to kill the 3 elites inside the vault - we just distract and sneak past.<br /><br />Only problem was those damn dogs. They spot invis from far away. I guess that with some time and learning how to do it, we should be able to get the vault with no deaths.<br /><br />Tip on groups with dog and 1 elite:<br />Blind elite. Kill the dog ASAP then vanish.<br /><br />Got 2 Essence from a single run :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soloed it as a 60 rogue with no imp sap.&nbsp; What i did for the coffer room with the guy closest to painting,&nbsp; is ambushed/killed him in a few seconds, then vanished.&nbsp; Read the painting, went to the keeper, sapped one, mind controlled one with the cap, and killed the keeper.&nbsp; I tried it without a cap and failed, so the cap makes a huge difference.&nbsp; Only downfall is the 30min cooldown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Alright I have the 10 Blue and 10 Yellow &amp; spoke to the guy in Burning Steppes but when I head to ungoro and click on the pylon nothing happens...<br /><br />Is there a certain quest I have to do in order to be able to click the pylon to get my crystal spires?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>And you get the Arcanum, can you use it as often as you want to enchant Head and Legs, or does it have charges?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know if I can repeat this once I got my first +20 FR. I want to put +20 on Molten Helm, and +20 on volcanic pants. Thanx :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Don't listen to the ill informed.<br /><br />Molten Helm is an excellent choice to put and extra 20FR on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have extra mats for this plus the burning essence (already have +20 FR to legs &amp; helm). <br /><br />I am thinking of using my Lesser Arcanum of Resilience to enchant someone else's leg or helm. <br /><br />What i'm interested in is your opinion on how much to charge for this. <br /><br />It won't be for a friend or guildmate, will just advertise in trade channel (i'm broke). <br /><br />I'm thinking it has cost me 155g-255g on the high end for time, effort &amp; materials on this. <br /><br />Also consider a +15 FR enchant to 'back' cost approximately 290g in materials on the server I play on. <br /><br />Do you think it's reasonable to charge 300g-400g to use my Arcanum for someone else?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Don't blame someone else for offering you 5g.&nbsp; Don't be lazy.&nbsp; Do your own research about the market value of something before you spam the Trade channel trying to sell it.&nbsp; If you'd sold it for 5g you would have only yourself to blame; that other guy wasn't forcing your hand.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyhow, it's only worth 200g if there's someone willing to pay that.&nbsp; Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i found it in UBRS i thought nothing of it when i won the greed roll, then my friend said on vent it was rare and it was for fire resist so i got every item for the enchant cept for the burning essance which aparently drops out of the dark coffer in BRD. i have done this many times to try and get the essance but it isn't 100% out of the dark coffer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok toughy this time - can you get the mats on your alt and send a BoE to him for enchanting? Will this bind the item to your alt? For instance I don&quot;t want to craft DI Legs and try this enchant on them only to have the bind to a hunter!<br /><br />Keep me posted!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did this in a 2man BRD group, myself (rogue) and hunter.&nbsp; <br /><br />Relatively easy if you guys work well together.&nbsp; Ventrilo helps.<br /><br />As always, good gear helps out a lot.&nbsp; We did this in Tier 1 gear.</div>
