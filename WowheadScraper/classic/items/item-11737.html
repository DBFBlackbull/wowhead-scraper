<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are a number of other books found around the world. They are &quot;lost texts&quot; of the Quel'Thalas High Elves? There are two NPCs that &quot;collect&quot; these when you find them. <br /><br />One NPC, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=9836"><u>Mathredis Firestar</u></a>, is found in Flame Crest in The Burning Steppes. <br />He only accepts Librams of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4481"><u>Constitution</u></a> (100HP), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4483"><u>Resilience</u></a> (20FireResist), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4463"><u>Rumination</u></a> (100mana), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4482"><u>Tenacity</u></a> (125armor), and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4484"><u>Voracity</u></a> (+8 to any stat). <br /><br />The other NPC, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14368"><u>Lorekeeper Lydros</u></a>, can be found in the Library in the <b>Dire Maul</b> instance (North entrance). <br />He accepts Librams of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7484"><u>Focus</u></a> (+8 healing&amp;spelldmg), <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7485"><u>Protection</u></a> (1%dodge), and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7483"><u>Rapidity</u></a> (1% haste).<br /><br />Each of these enchants can <b>only</b> be applied to a <u>Head</u> or <u>Leg</u> item. Normal enchants provided by Enchanters cannot enchant Head or Legs, thus making these types of enchants that much more valuable!<br /><br />Each Libram is Unique so you can only carry one at a time. After finding said Librams and taking them to said NPC, the NPC will tell you what items you need to obtain the enchantment each book provides. For more information on how to obtain each of the components requried for the turn-in, click on the link I provided for each book to read about the quest associated with it.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
