The first place to look is in the room of Malor the Zealous. There will usually be one on the table, next to his books. The next place to look is in the room with columns, usually 3 or 4 mobs on the left, and three or four mobs on the right as you enter. The second spawn point for this thread is in that room, on a bench on the right side of the room.

The next place to look is in the room with columns, usually 3 or 4 mobs on the left, and three or four mobs on the right as you enter. The second spawn point for this thread is in that room, on a bench on the right side of the room. The third, and final place (as far as I know) is in the Archivist's room, on a crate against the back wall. These are not guaranteed to be there, but these are the three spots I was able to find mine at. I hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Exactly where do we pick up the thread?<br />I know its live side strat but where in it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>also curious as to where to get this in strath</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's on the table next to Malor the Valous... a mini boss in the bastion</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How many of them do you usually get per run? just one?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can this item be picked up in a raid?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes it can:P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It can be found in three different places in stratholme.<br /><br />1st: On the table next to Malor<br />2nd: In the small box with books in the left corner in Malor's room.<br />3rd: On a bench on the right side of the opposite room of Malor's room.<br /><br />And last run i took part at i found two at a time. One in the box with books and one on the bench.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found one in the room of Archivist Galford</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got 4 in one raid.<br /><br />They spawn one at a time. Once u grab one the next one spawns.<br /><br />First one in Malor's room on the small wooden board on the left side of his room facing his room from outside. HArd to target.<br /><br />Once u grab that then it spawns on his main table.<br /><br />Once u grab that it spawn in the archivists room on a wooden crate .<br /><br />Once u got that one spawns on the bench on the right side opposite malor's room. Same locations as my learned friends described above.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the thread drops in 3 places.. on the table center in the Zealots room... its a red spool... the second place is on a bench in the room hall way thingy facing the room with like 10 benches in it... the thrid is in the room before the boss</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found the scarlet thread as a drop just before the boss in strath SC. . . weird as it may seem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know why there would be none in a run?&nbsp; The first time I went to pick them up, I was the only one who needed it and I got all 4.&nbsp; But the next time I went (when I only needed 1 more), it didn't appear.&nbsp; And I'm assuming that none of the others spawned since the first one on the table didn't. <br /><br />Any ideas why it wouldn't have shown up?&nbsp; Is it not always there?&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The spawnorder is random I think, since I picked mine first in the basket, then in the other room at the bench, then the table etc, so check all 4 places and you will find them all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i went STSM more than 10 times by raid , and also can't look this item , who can tell me what's the problem , thx a lot</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone know for sure whether you can grab the thread if you're in a raid group?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, I can confirm that this drops in a raid group, just completed Living Strath today, got two in today's raid, one in the archivist's room and one in the zealous guy's room.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been through here quite a few times and have found the thread to spawn in the 4 locations listed earlier, though the order is completely random. All four always show up, but you have to look in all the places to get them due to the random order.<br /><br />They appear in the following places (can be found in RAIDS too):<br /><br />Malor's ROOM - crate on the floor in the back left corner facing the room<br /><br />Malor's ROOM - main table<br /><br />Archivist's ROOM - crate on the floor <br /><br />Across from Malor's ROOM - bench on the right side of room</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If the last thread is in the archivist's room, do not wait until the raid(yes raid) kills balazaar, otherwise you get about 1000 adds leading back to malor's room, which really sucks!&nbsp; So be sure to pick them up before you kill him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Perhaps you have to have the quest for this item before you can loot it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've done SM Strat 3 times in a row and they havn't appeared in either location... and believe me i double checked all the locations... have they changed it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is the Malor guy the first boss guy in the bastion?&nbsp; The one that guards the Medallion of Faith?&nbsp; Anyway, didn't see it in his room, then didn't see it in Archivist Galford's room after that.&nbsp; That was after two runs of specifically looking for the thread.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just got my last four thread all in one run, here's where:<br /><br />First one was on a bench in the room across from Malor's room (its a bench on the right side)<br /><br />Second one, I went back into Malor's room and there was one on the table on the right.<br /><br />Third, same room, in the box in the back left corner<br /><br />and Fourth, in archivist's room.<br /><br />Oh and it spawns RANDOMLY, so you have to check all four places EACH TIME you loot one.&nbsp; There's not a set order to where they spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Last raid there was two of them in one instance, and this run there was nothing, i spend 2 hours with noobs for nothing ))))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>so you can pick it up from inside Balnazzars room? Or is it only a drop?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Theres three rare spawns for the thread:<br /><br />1st - in the first room with the lockbox on the floor. (its on the table)<br /><br />2nd - on a bench in one of the hallways that has benches/books along the wall.<br /><br />3rd - in the archivist's room in the back resting on one of the boxes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just as an helpfull tip to everyone, don't ask for roll when you find one, cause then most likely half or more fo the entire party will roll. Make sure who needs it before you enter the scarlet building, this way you will most likely only get the people who actually need the threads to roll. In my case, I was the only one who needed it in both runs I did this (asked before we went in). If you dont, you will have ninjas rolling just because there's a roll.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can you pick this up in a raid?<br />Or do you have to 5 man FD strath? :shudder:</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On this run, I finally found them. I found them in 4 places.<br /><br />in the room with the sink in the back (Malor's room) I found 2! One on the table.<br />And one in a crate by the sink.<br /><br />In the next room, Right before you split to choose cannonneer or archivist, there's a room with 4 pillars in the middle, and 10 benches and books on those benches. I found a scarlet thread on those benches<br /><br />In the archivist's room, on a box in the back (east corner). I looted it after the room was burning, so don't worry about that.<br /><br />I went back a second time, and found 2 still in Malor's room, but there weren't any in the bench room.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 30th 2006 8:00pm by mckaysalisbury</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The thread is not just with the boss. It is small and bop and anyone can loot, so tell your party before you go. This is used to make Cap of the Scarlet Savant......and if I ever get the damn Pristine Hide of the Beast I'll have it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>they're in the room with the main scarlet guy i believe. he's the one that turns into a dreadlord during the fight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been to stratholme many times and I haven't seen any enchanted scarlet thread anywhere. Is there a certain area or room on the scarlet side that I'm missing?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>what's it used for? some of my guildies say its only for mages, and some say its for all caster classes.<br />is it BOP? im warrior and seen these things but mages want them so they loot it every time.</div>
