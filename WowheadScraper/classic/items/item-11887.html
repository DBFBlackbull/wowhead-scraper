<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My bag got stuff like:<br /><br />- Potion that detects undead on the minimap for 1 hour<br />- Potion that gives Dreamvision, lets you explore areas like the Warlock's eye<br />- Some potions that restore health and/or mana<br />- Some food<br /><br />And some more things I can't remember right now. I'm going to give him 10 more morrowgrain tonight, so I'll post an update what I get this time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What is the rate to get Morrowgrain out of the bag?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you buy seeds from the Druid in Darnasus, the recover rate for Morrowgrain is just shy of frustrating.&nbsp; <br /><br />But if you buy seeds from the Druid in Feathermoon Stronghold (the island in Feralas), Morrowgrain generates much more reliably.&nbsp; Furthermore, the guy on Feathermoon only needs 5 Morrowgrain to give you 10 new seeds.&nbsp; <br /><br />So go to Darnasus first, trade in 10 Morrowgrain for your supply of exotic elixirs, than head down to Feathermoon and use another 5 Morrowgrain for 10 more seeds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got one of these after the last patch,<br />and it had SIGNIFICANTLY less in it than the last<br />10-12 times I had done it.<br /><br />I typically would get a stash like someone mentioned above, 3 or 4 good potions, 3 or 4 random<br />food/drink.&nbsp; This time all I got was:<br />1 Arcane Elixir<br />4 Alterac Swiss<br />10 Moonberry Juice<br />10 Fine Aged Cheddar<br />1 Superior Healing Potion.<br /><br />A fluke or did it get nerfed?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1x Elixir of shadow power<br />1x Frost oil<br />2x Greater mana potions<br />5x moonberry juice<br />1x restorative potion<br />2x fine aged chedar<br />3x morning glory dew<br /><br />Not too bad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Picked up the quest in Darnassus after the 1.9 patch, and here is the breakdown.&nbsp; 7 attempts, 0 grain, 1 abandon.&nbsp; /shrug</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>completed today, got 100 rep gained.<br />- elixir greater agility<br />- greater mana potion<br />- moonberry juice (10)<br />- oil of immolation<br />- superior healing potion (2)<br />- fine aged chedder<br />- morning glory dew (9)<br />- scroll of strength III</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you are a herbalist your chance to get morrowgrain is significantly higher than if you are not.<br /><br />Those that are reporting good drop rates are either herbalists, or lucky.<br /><br />Those that are reporting bad drop rates are probably not herbalists, or unlucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Morrowgrain isn't all you get...kingsblood, goldthorn, dreamfoil and a few others grow from the seeds as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>People forget when reading, comments were added months ago before all the info was collected. So back then it was reasonable to ask what the drop rate was as thottbot didn't know yet.<br /><br />Then again, I'm replying to a 2month old post to say this...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It seems like this quest is repeatable from your comments, could somebody confirm it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm 305 herbalist and did the quest today<br />Results from doing it 6 times was 12 morrowgrain and 3 stranglekelp. Maybe it's begginers luck but I'll keep going.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The quest isnt about the cache, it's about raising your reputation.&nbsp; the cache is simply a bonus.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a herbalist, at 300.<br />I've tried it 5 times now and got only Kingsblood EVERY SINGLE TIME!<br />Back to the Crater for more soil...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Even if you were lucky enough to get a 1/2 ratio of success, how long will this quest end up taking you? <br /><br />The cooldown on the Evergreen Pouch to do this is 10 minutes! I'd rather keep my 4 inventory spots open.<br /><br />/abandoned the 100 rep</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>out of say 15-25 tryes i have 88 morrowgrain<br />im 300alch/herb</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Morrowgrain is not that expensive, and ya, the 10min cooldown is ridiculous considering you don't even get Morrowgrain every time.&nbsp; I got a guildy to give me 30 Morrowgrain for free. Got xp the first time around and some sweet loot every time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im not sure about others but im a herbalist and i got&nbsp; <br />a pretty sweet droprate.. like every other or third har&nbsp; 3-5 morrowgrain</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wait, this gives you an unending supply of these items? You just have to wait 10mins each time to refill it?<br /><br />Sounds pretty damn good to me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This quest is worth it if you are an alchemist/herbist OR attempting to raise your TB reputation.<br />(I think it's worth it as a quest in general but I am speaking in terms of repeating the quest)<br /><br />While you are questing the 9 million quests in Un'Goro pick up the soils. I also suggest checking the AH. Many people sell their soils at very low prices when they have completed their quests in Un'Goro.<br /><br />Purchase your supply of seeds. What I did was make a hot key on my action bars with the evergreen pouch so I could see when the timer was up. I tried it the other way (just having it in my bags) and forgot over and over again.<br /><br />Everytime it was active I clicked it. At the end of my hunting everyday I would fly into TB turn in the morrow grain and replenish my seeds.<br /><br />As an alchemist the amount of herbs gained from this is fabulous. I got tons of Gromsblood, dreamfoil, blindweed, and many other herbs that are difficult to find, used frequesntly so you can't keep a stock, or very expensive.<br /><br />The side benifit was getting the cache. I sold all the food/mana drinks to help offset the cost of the seeds. The potions I sold if I didn't use them. It provides greatly all the way around.<br /><br />This also had the side effect of the 50 honor each hand in.<br /><br />All the way around this was a very worthwhile and benefitial endevour.<br /><br />I highly reccommend it.<br /><br />GL hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got 5 on my first one, perhaps because i am a herbalist helps :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol I hate quests, but this one makes me hate them even more!<br />I don't really care about the rep, I just wanna get it done.<br />The 10 min cooldown is a hassle, all I can ask is &quot;why in the heck...&quot;<br /><br />xD<br /><br />&quot;...is there a freaking 10 min cooldown on this?&quot; rofl</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The rewards are random, differnt every time Ive done it. The quest also gives a small reputation bonus each time you do it. I dont know if it cuts out eventually, but I would like to find out. Would love to be one of the first undead on a kodo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>w00t</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>NO, you put in 2 ungoro soil, 1 seed, and a pouch... mix together and you get 1-4 (maybe more) morrowgrain. once you get 10, you turn them in to get the cache which contains what is posted above, but the contents vary as it would in a chest (don't think you get wpns, armor, or patterns, etc.).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So my warrior completes this quest, which is kinda a pain in the ass, and what does the cache contain?<br /><br />1x Cats eye elixer <br />1x Elixer of greater intellect<br />1x Greater Mana potion<br />4x Moonberry juice<br />1x Restorative elixer<br />1x Fine aged chedder<br /><br />All and all quite a let down. Especially since the only thing I didn't immediatly vendor back was the cats eye elixer. I don't know exactly what I was expecting from this quest, but was quite let down. The quest IS repeatable, but why bother?<br /><br />Perhalps if the satchel didn't have a 10 minute cooldown every time to use it, this quest wouldn't have been so ornery. If you are doing this quest, I wouldn't recomend paying for the soil in the AH. Just do the quest as you get the soil. Even then, If you aren't a mana user, I wouldn't waste my time doing it again.<br /><br />The one comment additionally I would like to make is that I did the Morrowgrain to Darnassus version of the quest, and can't speak for the horde side. Would be interesting to know if theres any variation in reward.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Feb 5 04:18:48 2005</div>
