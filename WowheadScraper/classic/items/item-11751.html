(no dogs). the other way is to go around the arena and then left, over the bridge, this involves 2 dogs, the first one, before the bridge, can be distracted and passed without combat, the second one u need to encounter. distract the dog and use sprint, cheap shot the dog, and run run run ---> vanish. (the big dog in the vault dosent see stealth)\n\nonce u are inside the vault, there are 2 ways to reach the picture which spawns the boss. 1: (the good way) kill the boss, i did it like this: mind numbling poison, garrote the boss, evasion+adrenaline rush+blade flurry, this will kill the boss and get the dog down to about 50%, but the dog hits hard as hell so if u dont make it, use blind and bandage, stun as much as u can. both the boss and his dog can drop blue items.\n\noption 2: (the easy way) kill the mob closest to the picture while using evasion, then vanish.\n\nopen the \"doors\" to the picture, and read the sign. now you get fuzzy clues to where the boss is. some of the locations are easy, some are impossible. the one in the arena is easy, aswell as the one near fineous darkvire.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>redaxe</b></h3>This is required, along with the Librarm of Resilience, to get the +20 Fire Resist enchant to head or leg items. It is a great boost to anyone that needs a good FR.<br /><br />This can be challenging to obtain though. It has a ~50% drop rate from the dark coffer which means that you may only see it drop once in every 2 runs. You then need to also battle it out with other members of the group. An the Dark Keeper Key can sometimes spawn in awkward places.<br /><br />I recommend you make good friends with a L60 rogue and pay them 20-30g to go in a get one for you. They can generally solo it easily (depending upon the location of the Dark Keeper spawn). You then give them the Libram of Resilience and other mats and let them do the enchant for you.<br /><br />It works a treat!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You do NOT need to do the arena event. <br /><br />We just did a stealth run with 2 rogues and 1 druid, and the coffer contained a Burning Essence and one Black Blood of the Tormented (for the mana libram) and a random green.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Me (60 frost mage) and 60 priest did this in 20 min.<br /><br />If you are lvl 60 you can walk through the arena by hugging the wall.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Done this solo as a combat rogue, had to clear the room where the window is, couldn't be bothered to reset until mobs were below lvl 54, so cleared a couple then vanished, repeated, opened window the guy came walking into the room with his 4 adds, i went to where the coffer is , waited till he walked to me , opened up with cheap shot, whacked on AR + evasion and killed him then vanished, lost about 300 HP, got eye of kajal and burning essence. Have reasonable gear, exalted defiler stuff, some NS parts, krol blde + brutality blade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is pretty simple to solo as a rogue. The guide the other guy posted is pretty solid though you don't need imp sap. Go to the vault and attack the mob closest to the portrait. You should be able to kill him and vanish before you die. Next get right up to the wall to the left of the portrait, open it and see who you need to kill for the key.<br /><br />You cannot solo the coffer key guy if he's the one in the bar or in west garrison. Otherwise it should be pretty simple. Run off and find the coffer key guy; sap one add and MC cap the other and kill the key guy. Loot and vanish as you should be getting attacked by the one you MC'd earlier now. Go back to the vault and open the coffer. Sometimes there is a guy with a dog right in front of the door; DO NOT worry, the dog is of mob type Demon and does not see stealth.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As someone already remarked, if Thottbot says it's 50% droprate but there are actually 2 each time it drops, then that means the actual droprate is 25%.<br /><br />I think Thottbot calculates rate by dividing number of loots by number of time the chest was opened.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tonight I found an easier way to do the coffer room spawn point. You can actually use distract to split the Dark Keeper from his 4 guards if you wait until he's at the end of his patrol on the far side of the room, outside of the vault. At that point, the guards lag behind him just long enough for you to throw a distract to make them stop. He will continue his patrol into the coffer room where you can attack him, using kick to interrupt his spellcasting, and pull him into one of the far corners of the room, where you can <b>very</b> easily solo him without the guards aggroing you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>let me tell you stealthing a burning essence = pain in arse. even following guide laid out in comment, which dont get me wrong is really useful, its not that easy. if you are prep. with improved sap then GG. i on other hand am combat with decent gear couple epics, lobo ect. you are constantly waiting for vanish cooldowns and ive died a number of times. good luck to you</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think many are confusing the chest that it drops from and the other coffers.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Last night I finally went and tried it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wasn't able to not pull a mob by the painting which bugged me, so I killed the one closest and vanished.<br /><br />He was in the closer of the 4 spots, targetable from the painting even.&nbsp; I thought I could kill all three at once but elites :\ and he has some kinda frost ability.&nbsp; So I burned him down with evasion on, looted and vanished.&nbsp; I didn't bother sapping or blinding.&nbsp; <br /><br />Steathed back and got me.....the tainted blood thing :\ only did one attempt for the night to try it out.&nbsp; I will be back for more!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the lastest patch may have changed this.<br /><br />I have max stealth and distracted from the painting. Other elites nearly also pulled. <br /><br />I think they may have linked the three groupsin the room as there was no way that I could get one group without getting the other two.<br /><br />I tried several positions around the painting to no avail. <br /><br />I also tried going in a different corner to pull the three groups seperately and take them down. All kept pulling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Excellent guide above by atog9. It's spot-on.<br />I'm lv60 rogue, with no imp. sap and 0/5 in MoD.<br />I had tried a few times soloing, and a few times with a druid - all previous attempts ended up with either us dying, or with the dark keeper spawning somewhere crap (like the bar). The one time we actually got the keeper spawning in a decent place (The Domicile) it was a Black Blood of the Tormented and a random green inside.<br /><br />I read atog9's post carefully here, and decided to have a go soloing using his advice. <br /><br />First couple of times, it was a lv53, then a lv54 nearest the painting, so i just got nekkid and jumped in the lava &amp; ran back &amp; reset instance.<br />Next time, it was a lv52 nearest it, so I jumped up on the ledge between the lamp thing and the painting itself and opened it up. When I read it, Bethek spawned with 4 elite guards in the same room (Note - you can read the sign when stealthed - it wont destealth you). Didn't fancy that fight myself, so I got nekkid and died.<br />Next time I tried, everything fell into place nicely. A level52 nearest the painting, and the Keeper spawned in the hall of crafting. Sapped one of his guards, took him and the other guard down with adr. rush, blade flurry, and evasion easy. Vanished, and went back to the dark coffer. Inside was a random green (again) and this time, a single burning essence. <br />One very happy rogue.<br />Date: 18th Sept 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks Bhuna, &amp; grats!<br /><br />Sometimes you can be lucky with the spawns &amp; the essence drop, &amp; sometimes nothing seems to go your way. I tried stripping/dying before, but after I timed it I found out it�s quicker to just stealth out, reset instance, &amp; come back in.<br /><br />I haven�t had imp sap in a very long time, combat daggers 15/31/5 now. I don�t even bother when the mob closest to the painting is elite, too many things can go wrong. But when he�s anything else I have no problem. 52 is the best of course. It�s a shame you didn�t try the Bethek(sp?) spawn, that�s my favorite since it requires you to use some skill with distract.<br /><br />Also I usually charge 80g to do this for someone if they have the mats. I think it�s fair considering that you may encounter some horrible luck. 50g to myself &amp; 30g to the vendor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im a rogue with combat talents and good gear. i did like this. step 1: getting to the vault. there are 2 ways to get to the black fault, first one is to take the first to the left once u enter the instance, and follow the big road full with mobs all the way passt incendius and fineous darkvire. (no dogs). the other way is to go around the arena and then left, over the bridge, this involves 2 dogs, the first one, before the bridge, can be distracted and passed without combat, the second one u need to encounter. distract the dog and use sprint, cheap shot the dog, and run run run ---&gt; vanish. (the big dog in the vault dosent see stealth)<br /><br />once u are inside the vault, there are 2 ways to reach the picture which spawns the boss. 1: (the good way) kill the boss, i did it like this: mind numbling poison, garrote the boss, evasion+adrenaline rush+blade flurry, this will kill the boss and get the dog down to about 50%, but the dog hits hard as hell so if u dont make it, use blind and bandage, stun as much as u can. both the boss and his dog can drop blue items.<br /><br />option 2: (the easy way) kill the mob closest to the picture while using evasion, then vanish.<br /><br />open the &quot;doors&quot; to the picture, and read the sign. now you get fuzzy clues to where the boss is. some of the locations are easy, some are impossible. the one in the arena is easy, aswell as the one near fineous darkvire. Find the boss (/target dark helps alot), and then kill him, loot the key, walk back to the vault, and loot the dark coffer. :)<br /><br />and no, you dont have to open any of the &quot;normal&quot; coffers to do this, and you dont need the shadowforge key.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To get the Burning Essence, you first need to examine the Portrait on the wall outside the Coffer Room. By doing so, you then get the name of the Dark Key Holder. (1 of 6 possibles). Once you do so, and have the name, you have to kill him, and then reurn with the key to open the Dark Coffer. The list of Dark Key holders and where they can be found are:<br />Dark Keeper Offgut West Garrison - room with Angerforge <br />Dark Keeper Bethek Patrols near Coffer room<br />Dark Keeper Vorfalk Grim Guzzler Tavern <br />Dark Keeper Zimrel Arena; upper seating area<br />Dark Keeper Uggel Top of ramp in Golem Room w/Fineous <br />Dark Keeper Pelver Domicile room (storeroom in center)<br /><br />All but 2 are fairly easy to do. <br />Bethek spawns almost instantly outside the Coffer room, so be prepared. <br />Vorfalk is surrounded by patrons in the Grim Guzzler. To get to him, you have to pull the patrons around him, 1 by 1, with the Dark Iron Ale.<br />Just make sure you kill the patron before they drink it, as it's limited in supply.<br />After all that, the Burning Essence is still a 50% drop, so you may need a few attempts before you get it. I still feel the drop is Quest related, so make sure you have the Libram of Resilience on you, and that you have already spoken with Mathredis Firestar in Burning Steppes, and that regardless of who gets the Dark Key, you open the chest. After weeks of trying and failing, I wasn't taking any chances. It is worth the effort! ..and it is BOP, and can't be split up; though you'll want the extra one anyway! An extra +40 FR can make a big difference in MC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok I just soloed all the spawns because the damn thing wouldn't drop.&nbsp; Every one is possible with a rogue(I'm combat swords btw).<br /><br />As stated earlier, with a stealth class what you want to do is go straight to the window where u jump down to Incendius, past Incendius up the stairs and to the coffer room.<br /><br />What you get depends entirely on the how the instance spawns.&nbsp; Sometimes you will get packs with a dog, sometimes with two or 3 or I think even 4 elites.&nbsp; This is important because sometimes the mob near the painting can be an elite or paladin class or you can have casters on the other side of the room or something.<br /><br />If you get the keeper who patrols in the coffer room, it may be too difficult to kill him solo if you haven't cleared either outside or the room with the painting.&nbsp; Otherwise u can seperate him with a timed distract.&nbsp; The importance of the spawns also becomes apparent when you have dogs in a group that u need to stealth past... if there are, just kill the dog and get to a clear spot to vanish.<br /><br />Try to have itemrack or something to take your weapons off if you know you're going to die, and if you're going to kill a keeper make sure u get the key.&nbsp; One time I had the easy one next to the room with the dark coffers and I killed all three and then a Fireguard pat came around the corner and scorched me to death before I looted: Moral of the story there is that I should have looted instead of being cocky.<br /><br />Once you do have the key, u can stealth into the coffer room and open it no sweat.&nbsp; The elite dog cannot see through stealth, so don't be afraid of him.&nbsp; Your mission is to get the key... if you have the key you can stealth to the coffer and loot in less than 5mins from a fresh instance if you needed to.<br /><br />The actual contents of the coffer varies.&nbsp; It seems to always have a green, and it will not always have the white items: sometimes I got the burnt blood, the eye, one time the burnt blood and the eye, a few times just the green, etc.&nbsp; And only on the last time did I get the fiery essence thing.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Been needing 2 of these things as everyone does at some point. Being a rogue I thought Id give the old soloing skills a test (thanks to the odd guide on the site!). <br /><br />So first ever run, entered and got to the the vault easy enough, lvl 52 near the pic so all going good. Needed to go to the arena viewing area (the guides say this is a good one, nice again!) Found the guy and his 2 friends, saped 1, blinded 1 and pwned the key holder! grabed the key and vanished. Made my way back to the vault, thought the dog could see through stealth. After waiting for vanish to recover i went for it (THE DOG CAN'T SEE THOUGH STEALTH! winner). Opened the coffer and the box inside..... got some green chest and 2 Burning essence! Well saved me hours of time and made me a little happy :D<br /><br />So this is patch 1.12 and still doable.</div>
