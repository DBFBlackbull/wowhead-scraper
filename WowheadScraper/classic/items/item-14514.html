I congratulated the warlock and gave him all the essence of undeath he needed(didn't need them). So after the raid I decided to go on thottbot to see the drop rate and my jaw hit the floor. It's a 0.1-0.4% drop rate... lucky SoB T_T</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>a lvl 60 mage won this, we speant five mins. telling her she could never sell the robe, or give it away. Idiot thought the pattern was BOP she actually used it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Shiva, be glad you lost the roll. The robe pattern can only be looted by a 300 Tailor Warlock - it has a tendency to disappear from the bags of a winner who isn't one.<br /><br />No, I'm not joking. Happens with all the epic robe patterns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my 20-30 Scholo runs have now dropped twice.<br /><br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/lanck/epiksor.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://koti.mbnet.fi/lanck/epiksor.jpg</a> <br /><br />Edited, Mon Jun 20 11:57:50 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this from my first Scholo run..<br /><br />Was pretty happy with it cause I just got 300 Tailoring =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i know all servers are different but someone saying 200-300g seemed extremely expensive, then i saw that it went for 1500-2000g cant believe how much it is on your servers, got my one for 40-45g cant remember exactly, and im gonna farm the rest maybe request the essence of fire from guildbank bought a few felcloth if i stop spending now i will have only spent 51g not bad for an epic like this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First epic drop ever seen and there is no warlock in group. What a waste.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>its gettting sold at 10 to 40g max on skullcrusher<br /><br />i dont get it, the robe of the archmage pattern &amp; truefaith vestments sell for 150 - 300g &amp; when you say WTS pattern robe of the void 100g, they laugh at you and call you a nub oO</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First purple item I've seen drop, and I won the roll. Sold at AH for 250g buyout, I overpriced it but someone wanted it bad enough. Yay me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this pattern for 23g on Jubie'Thos<br /><br />Now being a 300 Tailor isn't so bad :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got this last week.<br />made the robe and now have +345sd setup. (sm/ruin)<br />this robe rocks just wish the cooldown for the heal was 5min instead of 10.<br /><br />Lilwen<br />Blackhand</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These pattern's need to be changed to learnable by job class only.<br /><br />Its kinda %^&amp;*ty that they let a job class learn something they can never use or sell.<br /><br />Most people in the heat of the moment will just learn it, to be disappointed at a later date.<br /><br />Worse still, make it and then realise it is BoP. (that would hurt)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got it for 50g.<br /><br />nobody wants to buy, because robe is BoP and drop rate got upped last patch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah i actually got my tailoring up to 300 like 2 hours ago. Started it yesterday and only worked on it for like 4 hrs. All i need left is 9 Essence of Fire (i got the rest) and my guild is helping me with everything (PoA). Going to be on around midnight to go farm for them and may buy some on AH....ill add u to my friends list and /w u when i can make it, so i can show u what it looks like (if your on). I think ill be the first on the server. Its badass looking.</div>
