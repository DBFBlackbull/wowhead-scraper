<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>34056</b></h3>Got one of these from a Risen Construct.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well you need them too for the Libram of Focus, that I make for warlocks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well seems how no one wants to answer the question &quot;where is this?&quot; I went through the trouble of looking on Allakhazam and finding out:<br /><br />After killing Lady Barov, the Skin of Shadow is a lootable object in the small room she was standing in. It's been to the right of the door as you come in, in my experience.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of 1.9 here are all your answers:<br /><br />Where is it?<br />&nbsp; Skin of shadow can be found in Scholo as a clickable item next to a boss (sorry don't remember her name) on the lower left room of the final square (6-boss area).&nbsp; There is ONE clickable skin on every run.&nbsp; It ALSO can drop off of certain creatures in scholo, most notably the risen constructs.&nbsp; Verified because one droped for me off them and I was shocked (who knew).<br /><br />Can i do it in raid?<br />&nbsp; Yes, both the single clickable one and drops can be obtained in raid.<br /><br />Can I stealth in &amp; get it?<br />&nbsp; There is an unpickable locked door that requires a 1-time use key from the large skeleton boss on the upper floors.&nbsp; If you're planning a stealth run either bring someone that has the key on them, or you gotta go kill the boss first.&nbsp; If you are able to get there, the skin is next to the boss whom agros when unstealthed.&nbsp; She is not stunnable.&nbsp; Either distract/hold her in some way &amp; run/vanish/hearth or kill her. <br /><br />What is it used for?<br />&nbsp; As per all the posts above, it is used for various items.&nbsp; Crafting a Shifting Cloak (purple).&nbsp; Quest list for Breastplate of Bloodthirst (purple) and 2 plate leggings (purple).&nbsp; Quest list for Dire Maul librum. <br /><br />Can I pick it up &amp; sell it?<br />&nbsp; Its BoP (bind on pickup) so it ONLY does good to those that can use it for the above reasons.<br /><br />Which of those should get priority?<br />&nbsp; My OPINION is anybody who has the quest item lists (breastplate/leggings/librum) and is seriously collecting the list has equal right to (and maybe a little bit more need than) a Shifting Cloak creator.&nbsp; However i recommend those people have the cromatic carapice or pristine hide first.&nbsp; Otherwise no reason Shifting Cloak creator shouldn't get it.&nbsp; (That's opinion folks, please don't flame me :)&nbsp; )<br /><br />Zuztet</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since people are getting their panties in a bunch, it might be helpful to lay out the facts. This item can be used for 5 things at this time.<br /><br />1) For the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=36198">Shifting Cloak</a> - Which takes some rare items to make, this probably being the most difficult.<br /><br />2) <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7484">Libram of Focus</a> - Again, this is likely to be the most difficult part.<br /><br />3) <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8829">The Ultimate Deception</a> - A rare quest from Silithus once the gates are open.<br /><br />4) <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5068">Breastplate of Bloodthirst</a> - A very nice Epic rogue/feral druid chestpiece, which requires many difficult items to complete, hardest of all <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12731">Pristine Hide of the Beast</a><br /><br />5) <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5167">Legplates of the Chromatic Defier</a> - Very nice Epic legs for a hunter, which requires many difficult items to complete, hardest of all <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12871">Chromatic Carapace</a><br /><br /><b>Who should it go to?</b><br /><br />Considering that the 2 epic items (Breatplate and Legplates) require a VERY rare drop, a curtious player should pass on it if they do not have the Hide or the Carapace. <br /><br />Both of these items require a 300 skinner to have either <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13374">Finkle's Skinner</a> or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=51415">Zulian Slicer</a> and a trip to UBRS and a lot of luck. I have been there many times with the Skinner and I have seen the Hide drop once, never the Carapace. At one point I started to collect the other items, but stopped because I realized it was pointless and took up bank space unless I had the Hide (I am a rogue).<br /><br />To me, it seems a waste to take it from someone who can use it immediately, rather than the person who maybe one day could use it (if they don't have a better item by then).<br /><br />So, if a member of the party has the Cloak pattern, the Libram quest, or the other Quest and you do not have the Epic skins - be polite and let them roll. <br /><br />Anyone who is in a party where one of the members does have the Epic hides - be polite and let them have it.<br /><br />Anyone who is greedy and whines about it and rolls against one of those people will most likely be put on my Blacklist.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ran my first instance since the 1.10 hit and it was scholo. We saw skin of shadow drop like 3 times in the instance. None of us really needed it oddly enough, but I thought I'd put that out there for everyone who's wanting to make shifting cloaks or doing their quests. Pretty sure the drop rate has been increased (or maybe it was one really lucky run, who knows?)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't like that they took away the one near the Lady.Just ran a complete Scholo and no skin at all.At least before you were guaranteed to see at least one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ran scholo yesterday, 5 drops... I was amazed.<br /><br />Sad to hear it everyone though. Must have been lucky... Probably wont happen on the next run.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey Artemisdk, which mobs dropped these things?<br />If only the constructs drop 'em, a lot of 60 level epic rogues and druids can go farming for skins now....<br /><br />And to the guy who saw no drops.. did you clear all the constructs or just do the two pulls to get Rattlegore?<br /><br />And for the record, I agree taking away the guranteed one is gay.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dont know why they would make these so much harder than the stichings from Strath but they are since 1.10.&nbsp; <br /><br />Furthermore crappy pug's take 2.5 hours to clear this place......i hate it, 3 more skins for my pants so i'll deal with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>and ended up with 3 of them after finishing the 3 mini-bosses on the bottom floor.&nbsp; Dunno if that was luck or not but they all dropped off the risen constructs in Rattlegore's room.&nbsp; Was there with guildies so they let me have all of them :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If in fact it was dropped off a rat, it was probably in Scholomance. Other zones are just because the same mob appears in those zones and they only have one drop table for the rat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hi, i need 5 skin of shadow to complete my Breastplate of Bloodthirst. <br />- So where did they drop exactly?<br />Write to me at jegtisser@hotmail.com if you know where Skin of shadow drops.<br />Thank you..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i'll confirm this dropped in one run of a skeleton mage in the room with the original skin of shadow, and in another scholo run this dropped off a mob in rattlegores room. however we cleared all of rattles room for shammy epic 5 man quest, and only got 1 skin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>O_O it's a fake or not. Rat can drop something ?<br />If someone know how to drop it send me a mp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is it only lootable when doing scholo on a 5 man group?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So what exactly do you loot these from in Scholo? What and where should I be looking for them?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Lol dropped 7 times from a lvl 1 rat.. compared to going into scholomance.. hmmm.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>On rats dropping this, my friend was running a private server one day and killed a rat, he was able to loot it and got a skin of shadow. odd eh? I think it was a loot table glitch, but if someone had the same error as him and had wow reader running while playin on their private server..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>60 Rogue here, was 5 manning Scholo (as that is the only way to do it now) and all the bosses that normal drop Necropile only dropped effing Corruptor's and Skin's of Shadow. We only had the Necropile Robe drop, and all the rest of the bosses dropped Skins of Shadow... no one in the groupe desired theskins, so I grabbed em... hope I can find a use for em...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it probably wasn't really ever looted from a level 1 critter in Desolace :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Lol.. those rat drops are pretty wreid.. 10 skin of shadows dropped? :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1.9 changed this, they are random drop now. One dropped off the mage type guys in her room. Green too. The skin is also a chest type dealy and is still implemented,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As of now, Skin of Shadows are drops as well as looted from the Skin of Shadow object. Any of the mobs in Rattlegores room or the room where the Skin is found can drop them. It's unknown if this is intended or not because it wasn't released in the 1.9 patch notes. But since we got 3/4 on one run, I'm not complaining. It's much easier to get the Skins to make this now making the Essence by far the hardest thing now.<br /><br />They do not drop of rats, most likely someone killed a rat right before someone looted it and Wow Reader thought it was off a rat. It happens all the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>trahsmobs near Rattlegore droped 2 for us in Scholo today. lost both btw.</div>
