<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It does take quite some time to get drops. But it is fun. I mean if you could do quest in 30 seconds that would suck. Enjoy the lovely drops like the icemail jerking I got after 30 mins of killing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>wahaha! SpecialistEonar, I think it's lank funny, and appreciate ur sense of humour :) Rest of them are probly from Deutschland.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xLunacyx</b></h3>Man these drop rates are terribad, gone often 6 inbetween leg drops and there's only like 8-10 spiders in the zone and are quite contested at most times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mewse</b></h3>The drop rate seems bad but the spiders can drop up to 4 legs at a time. I was about to drop this quest after not seeing any legs on the first 6-7 kills but then completed it fairly easily by picking up 3-4 legs at a time from the spiders that did drop the item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pepeu</b></h3>I hate this quest with passion. I've killed 50+ spiders. Could be 75+ as well over the days. Not a single drop so far. And yes, I am killing the right spiders.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Antifungal</b></h3>I made account just to post that one :D<br />I really hope it is not just a coincidence , however... I took up the quest, started killing right spiders..killed like 30 of them and got 3 shafts.<br />I came here to easy my pain, well nothing to cheer me up I have found.<br />And then - on the map, I've noticed one of the quest items - Goodsteel ledger - which is basicaly a book you pick up just at the ^&amp;*!house the quest giver is.<br />There's nothing special about the book - it just cointans items you need to get to get quest done.<br />I read it and went back farming spiders. To my suprise - suddenly they started to drop like crazy! x4 x3 and I was done in few short minutes.<br />Is that the key? First take the book - read it and get to spiders? Hope it works for you guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Obolon</b></h3>Extras will stay in your bag after turning in the quest. They are safe to delete.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kevinish</b></h3>Drop rate is more like 5%. And these spiders drop almost nothing of value, and aren't skinable. Once you get past the legs, it's an easy quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>erkangorgulu</b></h3>Kill with spells not basic attacks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>l337neteng</b></h3>Pick up the ledger off the ground in front of the outhouse or the spiders wont drop the leg shafts</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Battlescar2112</b></h3>Typical Blizzard quest where there's never enough of the mobs that you need (I was the only one around killing these at the time), spending most of the time running around trying to find them. Then, the terrible drop rate. I killed 14 in a row without a drop. Took way to long to complete. Very bad.</div>
