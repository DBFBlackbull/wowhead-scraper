<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Atlantian</b></h3>well, 10 hours farming, 3 hours sleep and nothing. went to AH and found it for 60g. Thanks to that n00b that didnt know its true value. I would say at least 180-200g with such a poor drop rate. Any high end guild member could easily pay for this item and save themselves the headache.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7900</b></h3>The item is not TOO hard to farm, as long as you know exactly what you are doing. First of all, it is not really hard to farm this item, from a hunter standpoint. I recomend actually waiting for them to spawn OUTSIDE the cave, so as to prevent getting killed by the slimes that spawn mobs with their deaths. It DOES NOT drop from the slimes, as far as I know. But the floating elemental things do drop them. I got mine on kill number 13, but I do hear others have killed more and got none.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4336</b></h3>This recipe does not drop from the slimes, only the elementals. But if you kill the slimes you can get a nifty little pet called &quot;Digusting oozeling&quot;. Its a nice pet that sells pretty well.<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20769">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20769</a><br /><br />Be sure to kill everything in the cave, since they all share spawn points. The more you kill, the more often you can kill an elemental.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9029</b></h3>Good potion to have in nature-based instances, such as Ahn'Qiraj, at Princess Huhuran for example. The mats aren't exactly that hard to find, though Elemental Earth is relatively harder to get than say, Elemental Fire.<br /><br />Wish there were a transmutation recipe similar to Heart of Fire one, only for Elemental Earth :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>13918</b></h3>Either I'm incredibly lucky, or the drop rate has increased significantly. I got three alone in under an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've killed a thousand of Decaying Horror, no drop so far... It's almost 2% and that means around 50 should be enough, over 1000 should be impossible to kill without a drop ;D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually, if it has a 2% chance of dropping each kill, there is only a 64% chance of it dropping at least once in 50 kills:<br />Since = 1 - ,<br />P(d,k) = 1 - (1-d)^k,<br />where d is the drop rate, k is the number of kills, and P(d,k) is the probability that it drops at least once. So,<br />P(2%,50) = 1 - (1-0.02)^50<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 64%<br />P(2%,100)= 87%<br /><br />If the drop rate is really 1% (as the lvl56 mob indicates),<br />P(1%,50) = 1 - (1-0.01)^50<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 39%<br />P(1%,100)= 63%<br /><br />If you really did kill 1,000 of them, then yes, you are pretty much guaranteed to get at least one, whether d is 2% or 1%:<br />P(2%,1000)= 99.999999832%<br />P(1%,1000)= 99.995682875%<br /><br />So, if you did kill that many, you're either exceptionally unlucky or Blizzard changed the loot table. However, if you were exaggerating and only killed 100, not 1,000, then you only had between a 63% and an 87% chance of getting at least one, which is nowhere near a guarantee.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i cant find these guys. there are only slimes at the position shown in western plaguelands. and some lvl 62 elite in the cave with more slimes behind him.&nbsp; anybody know where they are? i searched wpl and epl</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wish i could get these dam protection recipe this is a my second day of grinding for a protection recipe i spent all yesterday killing lvl 60elite for the frost protection recipe with no luck. Now I', trying for this one and I've picked up 6 Living Essence 2greens and made about 4gold in cash and still no recipe.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It still drops, I just got it after about 5 hours of farming theses guys, killed about 180 elementals before I finally got the recipe.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What I mean is, the blue or red slimes can be killed and respawn as the recipe droppers, what id do as a rogue is stealth kill all the rotting behemoths/decaying horrors then when i went too long without seing one (even just 6 mobs in a row that weren't what i wanted) id waste a bunch of slimes (as a combat rogue id grab 3 of the worse kind, evade, bladeflurry, adren rush - then when you have 3 dead oozes you have 15 little turds &gt; vanish! and proceed)<br /><br />the next lap anywhere between all 3 and none would have spawned what you want.<br /><br />so to those commenting the cave has like 2-3 in, destroy the place, and I guarantee alot more will respawn. <br /><br />Im fortunate to have a very good grinding char who has stealth too, but if your too slow in there (priest would have such a ballache of a time...) id say take a mage or lock to aoe or your going to be tearing your hair out without stealth.<br /><br />did a pair of 1 hour sessions and got it right at the end of the 2nd hour - as a rough guess id say around the 60-70 mark but im not basing that on any data (grinding mode brain = no memory :) )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed all day yesterday for this recipe and got nothing... not even a cheesy green drop. Then thismorning im there for about an hour&nbsp; when i got the recipe.. So I thought well i might as well kill the rest of them in the cave while im here.&nbsp; oohh what do you know&nbsp; another recipe..&nbsp; then i leave the cave and kill one outside and i got another recipe.. lol&nbsp; i cant believe my luck. and then right outside the cave there was a blood of heroes. then I killed one last rotting behmoth and got a living essence.&nbsp; so i got 3 recipes for greater nature protection, a blood of heroes, and a living essence all within 15 minutes after finding my first recipe.. lol&nbsp; Dont think ill ever be that lucky again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well.. ive made it a lifestyle farming these.. as a mage you can easily farm these things.. i farmed em until the xp reward was too small for my taste.. then moved on to the shadow mages and dark adepts in EPL.. well i got this recipe 3 times.. sold all on AH.. the same thing has happened with the greater shadow protection pot recipe... lozor just money in the ban.. a good time is.. if you wanna farm exp.. do it where the chance of this kinda expensive things drop :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>#1. There are NO horrors in or around that cave. I've been here farming for about 9 hours off and on.<br /><br />#2. The slimes to share spots with the behomoths.<br /><br />#3. You can pull the red slimes and not aggro the blue annoying ones.<br /><br />#4. The drop rate is FAR lower than shown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the behemoths and horrors repawn at a rate about 25% in the place of the slimes.<br /><br />Don't cherry pick the Behemoths, as they may respawn as a slime.&nbsp; I did that for about 3 hrs and there were almost no behemoths to drop.&nbsp; You need to kill everything that moves to increase the chance that there is a behemoth that has a 1% drop rate.<br /><br />I got 2 other guildies (a mage for the AOE of the oozelings) and we wiped the entire cave 3x over.&nbsp; So many more behemoths to kill, and with 3 people grouped - we got it in 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />Basically - 25% of 1% means you should expect to kill about 400 total NPC's in this cave.&nbsp; I went on the high side for me - had I solo'd it the whole time - 10hrs.&nbsp; With a 3+ man group - expect 1-3hrs.&nbsp; Any sooner - and it's a jackpot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It just dropped for me in the cave, too easy. I just had to AOE the oozelings and after an ooze killing session, the whole cave would be full of the recipe droppers :D<br />PD: I just said, I am sure this one will drop it.. This one can drop it! Sure it can! (arcane missiles volley) and dropped XD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been grinding this cave for the past 5 days for several hours a day. Nothing dropped. =/ Meanwhile I have gotten about everything else they can possibly drop including a traveler's backpack and the living breastplate recipe twice. I am now also drowning in living essences, hearts of the wild and also got a few major healing potions. Has blizzard changed the drop rates for these since 1.10? I must have killed hundreds of these things and I get the feeling it's not 1% anymore. I guess i'll just keep on grinding, the recipe can't elude me forever.<br /><br />Also, as an alchemist I find oil of immolation to be a nice substitute for the AoE lacking classes (just be sure to bring a <u>lot</u>), or those that have low mana pools. That plus the several potions you can make to enhance your fighting. This has made the burden a bit lighter for me as paladins are slooow grinders.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>/thanks<br />i grinded inside &amp; outside the cave for 1 hour, mostly killing the slime, just killed around 15 behemoths &amp; dropped the recipe, orz...<br /><br />lvl 54 warrier Conana at Silvermoon :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The poster who figured around 10 hours solo and 30-45 min with a 3-man group is just about right.<br /><br />It took me 12 hours of solo fighting that cave before it dropped.&nbsp; This was not an easy find.<br /><br />There are two types of oozes.&nbsp; The redder (Vicious Ooze) variety spews fire damage while the other spawns level 40 pain-in-the-neck baby oozlings.&nbsp; When the main ooze is dead, you're left with approximately 5 or more baby oozlings to contend with.&nbsp; The trick is to not concentrate on the little oozlings until the main ooze is dead.&nbsp; They don't drop loot and spawn in the same number when the main dies anyway, so you're wasting your time trying to kill them off as they start coming.&nbsp; An aoe is best to finish them off.&nbsp; Adds will make this cave a nightmare if you're not careful.&nbsp; Even when you are careful, adds can and will pop on you. <br /><br />I stayed in one area at the beginning of the cave and just killed oozes, then Behemoths, then Horrors, until it finally dropped at 3am.&nbsp; These are random spawns meaning that anytime you kill an ooze, either another ooze, Behemoth or Horror can spawn.&nbsp; The recipe only drops off the Behemoth or Horror.<br /><br />I'm never going back to that stinking cave again!&nbsp; It's not worth farming and it's not worth the 100g on the AH either.&nbsp; I just needed the alchemy spell.&nbsp; I did get a blue back piece however and a blue leatherworking pattern, some living essences and random sellable junk to repair with.&nbsp; I consider myself lucky!<br /><br />Directions:&nbsp; I landed at the Chillwind Point (Eastern Plaguelands)flight path and headed towards Andorhal (left).&nbsp; I swam across the water just before Andorhal and stayed to the left until I got to the road that leads into Western Plaguelands.&nbsp; Make a right on this road (if you go left, you're going towards Scarlet Monastery - go right)&nbsp; When I got to the bridge I started to cut into the left at the water's edge.&nbsp; The Weeping Cave is not far from this point.</div>

I could take like 5-6 behemoths/slimes whatever in a row without eating. And I got the recipe after about 20 minutes. Will keep farming for it, since it goes for 150-200g on the AH atm. I really need the gold.<br /><br />Anyway, just kill everything that is inside there. You will get more behemoths respawned, and you will make money at the same too. If you're lucky, ooze bags will drop a little. Each contains about 20s.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been farming them for a couple of hours yet, no drop yet, but I'm fine with it since I've always been lucky with grinding a certain drop, but what annoys me about those is thaty ou're forced to kill oozes who share the same spawn points, ok they both have nice drops, specially since I'm an alchemist(duh) so the herbs they drop regulary are always welcome. But what bothers me about the oozes is the fact they spawn 4 little ones with around 800 hp when they die, such a pain in the ass to kill without a decent AoE, in another way..it sucks if you're not a mage, so I'm grinding it with my friends mage because I have 2 sit down to eat and drink after every ooze with my warlock, oh well I hope it's worth it.</div>

This place is rather bad for farming considering you have to kill oozes and slimes to spawn elementals. But with price for receipt over 100g it worth it.</div>
