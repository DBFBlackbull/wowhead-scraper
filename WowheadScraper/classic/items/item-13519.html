It's not in the AH, but I'm guessing it goes for 1000g-... This is great for warriors and such! Good luck making it though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3118</b></h3>Prices cary greatly server wide. On my server so many of these have dropped one cannot make a premium on the materials for crafting it. The recipe is a great one to have, but anyone who raid's &quot;knows a guy&quot; with it. Younger servers may have this for 1K+ but I rarely see it selling for over 500g at home.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7423</b></h3>These go for anywhere between 300-1000 gold depending on if the seller realises what its worth and the low drop rate. Its one of those recipes every guild needs that does raids beyond Molten Core.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>598</b></h3>Very key recipe for any raiding guilds alchemist to have, craftign them can be a pain because you need an alchemy lab to make them. There is an alchemy lab located in the alchemy room in Scholo ( the room with Raz the litch) or in BWL after you kill Firemaw.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>StoneLegion</b></h3>This recipe is one of the better ones but one the most expensive as well. It can be obtained by drak in ubrs..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>28162</b></h3>So is this still obtainable from UBRS, or is it just a rep item now?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>12489</b></h3>Now available as a rep purchase from the Shatar, but also still drops in UBRS. There's an alchemy lab in lower city in Shattrath so flasks are no longer such a pain to create.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>53023</b></h3>Does this drop from Drak, or did bliz take that off his drop list?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Where is this found?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>there is more than 3 places to get black lotus... you can find 2 at a time in the pvp arena in the middle of dire maul when they spawn.&nbsp; theres also one that spawns in the bottom left corner of eastern plagulands.. i dont have this recipe yet but i have 20+ black lotus.. ther not that hard to find.. the only gay part is wandering around boring areas to get all that gromsblood</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is a Lab in Black Wing Lair. So no need to waste your time doing scho. That is assuming your raid group can make it to the room. Have to kill around 4-5 bosses to get there. But once you get in a decent guild you can pretty much make these all you want.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>2 in Burning steppes,<br />2 in epl<br />1 in winterspring<br />4 in silithus</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well i know guilds who uses about 5 or 6 in BWL a week it's not that hard if u have everyone wither gathering herbs or fishing for the eels i can collect enough gromsblood alone to make 3 flasks and if i bring about 5 others to fish u can get enough to make um in about 2 hours</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since we're doing BWL guildwise (solo is kinda hard ;)), and we need the flasks for certain bosses, it's no more then logical we get the mats as a guild effort :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>an alchemy lab in undercity. apothecarium.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Someone just sold this for 1601 gold on Aszune EU. Amazing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yeah you did the wrong thing... that thing sells for easily 500g or more</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Not really a tip for the non-BWL player but an interesting thing to note for the future if your guild is heading there.<br /><br />After you clear up to the Alchemy Lab itself you can enter by yourself anytime to go make Flasks at your own leisure. Most guilds clear BWL on Fri and Sat, that leaves the time from around Fri or so until Server Maintenance to make all the Flasks your heart desires, without the hell of Scholo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the two best ways to make money from alchemy on my server are(detheroc):<br /><br />3rd<br />major healing pots<br />5-10g<br />mats are like 10g for 4 stacks<br /><br />2nd best way:<br />Flask of titans:&nbsp; (the recipe cost like 700g so good luck getting it to drop)<br />70-90g a piece, mats for it cost like 60g, not to many farmers on my server<br /><br />1st<br />Major mana pots<br />13-20g a stack<br />mats cost like 16g to make 4 stacks<br /><br />60g-16=44g&nbsp; &nbsp; makeing 44g for sitting around buying mats and makeing em into things</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This potion is amazing, but it took way too much to get.<br />I ran UBRS a total of 121 times with the sole purpose of getting this potion. I didn't see it drop once.<br /><br />On run 122, I was master looter and it dropped. I know not whether any other alchemists were in the group, for I just waited until everyone ported out (i'm a mage, so I make the portal) and then snagged it. I'm sorry, but I was not going to risk losing it the one time it dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got it a couple of hours ago, i'm alchemist but i dont know if i should learn it or sell it, i will probably put it in AH for 2000g to try if there is some crazy guild who want to empty their guild bank for this one, if not, i will learn and craft some pots to sell them :))<br /><br />Shadea lvl 60 mage, Hakkar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Today i sold the recipe for 100g, considering that the flask will be easy to get once i hit 60-70. just a heads up guys. It sold in 4 mins flat. With mount riding skill costing 700 somthing gold. its a quick start. -afx</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dropped of drak the other night along with dreadmist robe, i need rolled dreaedmist and grolled the recipe, won the recipe sold on AH last night fo 400g.<br /><br />agathor - mug'thol horde</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm afraid to farm this or the supereme power cause of the HUGE possiblity of ninja's, blizzard should make a way to know a person's profession OR make those important recipes BoP (atleast the ones that drop from instances that is), I thought maybe I should get in a good guild so they can help me farm it, but again, there are many alchemists compared to other professions. To be honest my current plan to get this or any of the other important recipe (Greater fire/nature protection and flask of supereme power) is to wait for a good deal(or a stupid person) on AH, because I think the chance to get this one is quite small with the possbility of ninja's -.- but oh well...I think I'll end up changing my professions cause of this, alchemy has few but very important recipes, and most people know their value so yay for going ninja.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bought it for 10g sold it for 1000g Scarshield Legion</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was running a UBRS group and made it Master Looter before the fight and we owned the general. Then a huge shock when thru me, FLASK OF THE TITANS! I wasn't a silly ninja and didn't let the raid know that it dropped, the item was a need roll only item...alchy or not, I won the roll and sold it for 1,000 gold in under 30 mins from the time i put it up<br /><br />I'm happy, but if it sold that fast I wish I put it up for more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>600g you could sell that for a 800g on my server and you would get someone to buy it. Less than 2% drop rates makes this hard to get. <br /><br />I sold &quot;Recipe: Flask of Chromatic Resistance&quot; for 750g last week. And FlasK of titans is much more popular.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>some stupid person put this plan for 4g. 50 on ah. lol NAB!</div>
