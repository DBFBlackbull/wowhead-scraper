I have given up Ice Block and am now the only mage in my raiding alliance that doesn't use it. Trust me, without this, MC suddenly becomes a lot harder on the aggro front, but you learn to deal without it.\n\nAnother thing to point out is that newer people don't have as good spirit, mana regen or intellect (no epics kekeke). This means they need more efficient spells overall, frostbolt is cheap and frost is the easiest thing to solo with (good mana efficiency, taking no damage because of slow effect and shatter\/frostbite combo makes for some nice crit %). This slowly becomes less of an issue when you get good enough gear. If I now did MC purely on frostbolts I would never have to drink at all (arcane\/frost mage with 38\/0\/13 build, arcane medi\/arcane mind etc).\n\nNow the point about frost beginning to not be as good. Frostbolt takes +0.8dam for every +1dam from your items, Frostbolt crits take +1.6dam for every +1dam from your items. Fireball, however, takes +1dam for every +1dam from items and fireball crits +2.1dam from every +1dam from your items. Think, thats +400 to +500 dam on a normal good mage and thats +1050 damage OVER your normal crit (about 1000). Fireball crit for 2k damage is quite nasty, that can be forced by a combustion and the aggro isn't instant, ignite provides a DoT and thats how about 40% of the damage is done), not to mention firespec crit-rate is usually a lot higher.\n\nThis, however, comes to pieces as you enter Blackwing Lair, only one place where you can actually use fire, and that is on the trashmobs up to Broodlord (I actually think using fireball here is better than AoEing, since IAE doesn't take 100% from +dam items and Blizzard just gets interupted). I've come top of damage board using 11 points in fire (imp.fireball, ignite and pyroblast) with a PoM+AP spec (wee for Fireball->PoM+AP+Pyroblast aggro!). As most of the bosses are completely immune to fire and arcane takes a much bigger role because of aggro management (I beat most of the hunters in broodlord, maybe 1 or 2 above me because of my netherwind set, arcane subtelty and blessing of salvation).\n\nAnd well, I've tried all builds, all ways. And I must say that the mage talents are the most balanced talents for any class, I love how blizzard have made mages and although I may no longer be the best dps in the raids, I enjoy my class more than I enjoy playing any other (hunters are really boring, nothing to do except a few presses of buttons then FD). And I've come to the conclusion that my favourite build would be frost, simply due to the soloability of the spec, frostbite\/shatter is such a good combo, it's a random 15% frost nova and about 10-12% increase to crit-rate, this works on ragnaros by the way, funny to see him get frostbiten, (hehehe, sadly you're rarely the one to shatter the frost...bah!). However, for raiding I much prefer the arcane build, my equipment has a far sight to go and I end up oom after an ebonroc fight (I never use mana potions, flasks or any single-use items, though this is due to tanks still learning the rotation, even though they've had a few months now and we've taken Nefarian a few times already) and often end up almost OOM from Broodlord (arcane missiles take a loooot of mana!) but no other fight do I go oom on. Hence I am spec 38\/0\/13 without improved CS. I rarely ever PvP and am on a PvE server.","date":"2006-02-10T16:09:32-06:00","rating":10,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"you cant get ice block until AT LEAST lvl 30, and though most people at lvl 30 are still somewhat newbs, a mage should know his boundries by lvl 30.","creationdate":"2006-11-29T16:09:32-06:00","id":1174059,"rating":3,"commentid":2713777,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Vayder","importedSubject":"ice block"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SplinterEU","importedSubject":"Frost to Fire Mages"},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"id":2713807,"nreplies":3,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"If you need this, shoot me a whisper on Bloodscalp.\n\nChewza\n60 Priest\nSadistic Intentions","date":"2006-03-19T04:09:32-06:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I have this on the Alliance Side, as Sadistic intentions is Horde.\n\nPST Export in game for the enchant\n\nThe Corporation","creationdate":"2006-04-24T16:09:32-05:00","id":1174076,"rating":-5,"commentid":2713807,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"vassago2","importedSubject":"Bloodscalp Alliance Side"},{"body":"Haalitrox has this on the Horde side of Garona server, and will be glad to do this enchant for market price of materials +10% markup.","creationdate":"2006-04-24T16:09:32-05:00","id":1174078,"rating":-5,"commentid":2713807,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Haalitrox","importedSubject":"Garona Horde"},{"body":"pst or send me in-game mail, US Archimonde, Alliance, Karamon.","creationdate":"2006-04-24T16:09:32-05:00","id":1174072,"rating":-6,"commentid":2713807,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Karamon","importedSubject":"If you need this"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"chewza","importedSubject":"Just got this on Bloodscalp"},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":2713852,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"If you need this on Spirestone pst Lifzan (alliance).&nbsp; I'm on all the time...if I'm not I'll be on Lifzann (2 n's)...my alt.\n\n60 Hunter\nAlliance\nSpirestone","date":"2006-05-31T04:09:32-05:00","rating":-4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Lifzan","importedSubject":"I have this enchant (spirestone)"},{"commentv2":1,"number":14,"id":2713862,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Send a tell to Endahl if you need this enchant on Alleria, alliance side.","date":"2006-05-31T04:09:32-05:00","rating":-3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"endahl","importedSubject":"Frost Power on Alleria (Alliance)"},{"commentv2":1,"number":15,"id":2713872,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Just got this last night, dropped off Moam. pst if you want the enchant done!\n\nBaalzaman <- 60 Undead Mage (Blackrock)","date":"2006-07-06T16:09:32-05:00","rating":-3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Baalzaman","importedSubject":"Horde - Blackrock"},{"commentv2":1,"number":16,"id":2713884,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Fire is the best talent tree along with arcane to powerlvl.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The reason frost is so popular is because it is, quite simply, better for PvE than fire. It has about double the mana efficiency and substantially more survivability than fire, and simply does more sustained damage than fire can. Fire is for burst damage, frost is for PvE. Frost can also be used for burst damage but it's a bit trickier.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>was a fire mage till level 25 went frost to be better at crowed controll i run mc with several mages 2 fire the others frost the frost mages come out on top all the time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, in the lower levels, fire would be the best, but there are alot of things at level that point in both ways.<br /><br />At the beginning, I would like to say, that I am a level 60 frost specced mage. I would love to be fire, but I do MC 3 times a week, and I really dont believe that fire is good enough for MC.<br /><br />I must agree with, that most mobs in MC are NOT immune to fire, but you guys must remember that they often resist SOME of the damage.<br />Thats means that I believe that fire mages do more damage at mobs which are not immune or resist.<br /><br />I would say, that Frost mage do more damage than a fire mage in MC, but Fire mages owns Frost mages in PVP and in non-fire instances.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i dont know about that im a frost mage and the chiiled efect of my frost bolts has come invalubale in war dong gulch</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>war SONG gulch</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There are obvious benefits to each one, but I must say, for the beginners frost is a much better option, I'll get to why that changes later in the end.<br /><br />For a start, Ice Block is invaluable to the newbie mage, it means you can learn where your aggro max is and where your tanks abilities are without dying, trying to learn these things without ice block is hard. I have given up Ice Block and am now the only mage in my raiding alliance that doesn't use it. Trust me, without this, MC suddenly becomes a lot harder on the aggro front, but you learn to deal without it.<br /><br />Another thing to point out is that newer people don't have as good spirit, mana regen or intellect (no epics kekeke). This means they need more efficient spells overall, frostbolt is cheap and frost is the easiest thing to solo with (good mana efficiency, taking no damage because of slow effect and shatter/frostbite combo makes for some nice crit %). This slowly becomes less of an issue when you get good enough gear. If I now did MC purely on frostbolts I would never have to drink at all (arcane/frost mage with 38/0/13 build, arcane medi/arcane mind etc).<br /><br />Now the point about frost beginning to not be as good. Frostbolt takes +0.8dam for every +1dam from your items, Frostbolt crits take +1.6dam for every +1dam from your items. Fireball, however, takes +1dam for every +1dam from items and fireball crits +2.1dam from every +1dam from your items. Think, thats +400 to +500 dam on a normal good mage and thats +1050 damage OVER your normal crit (about 1000). Fireball crit for 2k damage is quite nasty, that can be forced by a combustion and the aggro isn't instant, ignite provides a DoT and thats how about 40% of the damage is done), not to mention firespec crit-rate is usually a lot higher.<br /><br />This, however, comes to pieces as you enter Blackwing Lair, only one place where you can actually use fire, and that is on the trashmobs up to Broodlord (I actually think using fireball here is better than AoEing, since IAE doesn't take 100% from +dam items and Blizzard just gets interupted). I've come top of damage board using 11 points in fire (imp.fireball, ignite and pyroblast) with a PoM+AP spec (wee for Fireball-&gt;PoM+AP+Pyroblast aggro!). As most of the bosses are completely immune to fire and arcane takes a much bigger role because of aggro management (I beat most of the hunters in broodlord, maybe 1 or 2 above me because of my netherwind set, arcane subtelty and blessing of salvation).<br /><br />And well, I've tried all builds, all ways. And I must say that the mage talents are the most balanced talents for any class, I love how blizzard have made mages and although I may no longer be the best dps in the raids, I enjoy my class more than I enjoy playing any other (hunters are really boring, nothing to do except a few presses of buttons then FD). And I've come to the conclusion that my favourite build would be frost, simply due to the soloability of the spec, frostbite/shatter is such a good combo, it's a random 15% frost nova and about 10-12% increase to crit-rate, this works on ragnaros by the way, funny to see him get frostbiten, (hehehe, sadly you're rarely the one to shatter the frost...bah!). However, for raiding I much prefer the arcane build, my equipment has a far sight to go and I end up oom after an ebonroc fight (I never use mana potions, flasks or any single-use items, though this is due to tanks still learning the rotation, even though they've had a few months now and we've taken Nefarian a few times already) and often end up almost OOM from Broodlord (arcane missiles take a loooot of mana!) but no other fight do I go oom on. Hence I am spec 38/0/13 without improved CS. I rarely ever PvP and am on a PvE server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Fire is the best talent tree along with arcane to powerlvl. It's best to use until lvl 55 or even to 60 as I did. Frost is a must if you start to do Molten Core and the likes. You will have no chance of survival when aggro'ing a boss that hits for over 2k if you do not have Ice Barrier and Ice Block. Also Cold Snap is a great help, just in case.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>+30 something? its probably healing your talking about.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, there is a enchant that gives you 30 spell damage(on weapon), there is also one that gives you 30 Healing (On gloves).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In MC and BWL, Frost is twice as good as Fire due to the extra resists/immunities and reduced dmg with fire.<br /><br />However in all other instances they are about equal, still Frost is slightly better. On my guild runs in mc/bwl/aq40 and naxx the top 2 dmg players are ALWAYS frost mages. So that's why im certain Frost &gt; Fire in PVE. <br /><br />I am however not sure in pvp, but i think frost is better again there due to higher survivability.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
