[i]I think[\/i] the thing that gets you respect or status in your guild or even on a server is how you treat others and how much you contribute, not the colour of your mount.\n\nFood for thought anyways.","date":"2006-08-15T07:07:13-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Devastradon","importedSubject":"Epic Mount Drop"},{"commentv2":1,"number":29,"id":3079078,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Theres one thing i dont get about it.

Fact is, if you already have an epic mount and then roll on a epic mount; one of your mounts is going to waste. Can't use 2 mounts at 1 time. So, either the mount you worked so damn hard to buy or quest for is rotting away in bank or this raptor is; with the exception of when you want pull this one out to stroll around a city and feel like your impressing everyone because it just \"looks cool\". Real good reason to deprive someone without an epic mount...why would you want to do that? I'd be happy if a party member without an epic mount got a break...and as far as \"rolling just because it drops so rarely\"...I know of tons of epic cloth items that drop rarely. Should everyone roll on those items because any class can use the item and it just looks cool? Non-clothies wouldn't get any real benefit other than the aesthetic appeal; just like people with epic mounts who rolled for epic mounts.You can disagree with this post all you want, but people who have epics mounts and then roll for epic mounts don't NEED them. So, it comes down to being greedy. Whether you find being greedy a bad thing or not means sh*t. Just stop with all the justification and be honest:You just WANT IT.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The drop does not depend on whether you kill the raptor pet/mount at the Bloodlord. Our guild killed the mount and this dropped off of Mandokir anyway. A NE priest named Gixxer now has it on Medivh.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If the drop rate really is 0.3%, then if you killed Mandokir 230 times, you'd have a 50/50 chance of it dropping one of those times. You'd have to kill him around 1500 times to have a 99% chance of it dropping. Even then, you're in a raid with 19 other people, so if it DOES drop, you have about a 1 in 20 chance of getting it. Not good odds, really.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On Uther server Thursday 6/22, the raptor dropped for the UEC Alliance on our weekly ZG run. First time I had personally seen it drop (out of only a couple of previous runs). <br /><br />The raid agreed to *all roll* this mount. This seems to be the most diplomatic way to roll for an item of this nature. I would have agreed to this regardless of the current status of my toon, whether I already had my epic mount, or whether I was at the top of the DKP list/SK list, or whatever. This is the kind of drop that will bust up a guild/alliance/raid if it is handled wrong, and I'm happy that we handled it this way.<br /><br />I won the roll and have been enjoying the attention, to be sure. <br /><br />Since I got this item, I have seen one other on Uther with the same mount. I don't know currently how many are on this server, but I bet it is less than 10 other toons. I have never seen the tiger mount on Uther, but have seen the Baron's mount once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did a run with my friend's mage to Zul'Gurub with my since my guild needed a mage.

Well, he never plays and I think about the mage as my mage.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We were lucky enough on our first tiger kill to have the swift zulian tiger drop, which went to one of our main troll warriors, Boogeyman, and this dropped off our last bloodlord kill (after about 30 kills), and I won (Orc Shaman).<br /><br />I'm the guild leader.&nbsp; To make these drops fair, I allow everyone in the raid to /100, whoever wins gets the mount.&nbsp; This is generally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, there is no way in hell I'm going to stop people on the run from rolling because they already have an epic.&nbsp; The only people who think that they shouldn't because of this are stupid noobs that have just hit 60 and couldn't be bothered farming/grinding to buy an epic.&nbsp; Christ, you can get a cheap one from AV!&nbsp; Its not hard.<br /><br />I love this raptor.&nbsp; It owns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This has not dropped for my guild yet and we are running ZG once a week - so it may never drop :P.<br /><br />Thing is though, and I know that this is a point of contention, I feel that if you already have your epic mount - from a untilitarian point of view - there is no point rolling / spending DKP getting this mount. In fact although I could not / would not stop fellow guildies who already have an epic mount rolling / spending DKP on this - I'd be disappointed in them for doing so.<br /><br />My logic goes like this: If you already have an epic mount you are actually weaking your guild by taking this, as other guildies will now have to spend 800 Gold (or however much it is) or months in the BGs (ie time not spent helping out the guild or each other and improving their characters) getting one. You can buy a lot of stuff with 800 Gold.<br /><br />For the people who think it's a status symbol, well... <i>I think</i> the thing that gets you respect or status in your guild or even on a server is how you treat others and how much you contribute, not the colour of your mount.<br /><br />Food for thought anyways.</div>

I guess you have to like the look of raptors to like this, but even though I don't like how it looks I'd ride it all the time if I'd actually won it :)<br /><br />Edited, Wed Feb 15 19:48:50 2006</div>

Now I'm not saying that people with lvl 40 mounts shouldn't be able to roll blah blah blah, I'm just saying that a large amount of people had to farm for their epic mount, and if the lvl 40 mount people want an epic so bad, they can farm for it just like everyone else had to.</div>

Or you are to lazy for farming? Make some research find out where most of your server guilds are going and craft items with correct resistances. ohh my god people are stupid and lazy. Get your epic mount riding skill (150), so when this actually drops you can roll. Nobody would be happy on you if this drops you win it and you cant use it. embarrasing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone who has an epic mount already and rolls for this is simply being greedy. Fact is, if you already have an epic mount and then roll on a epic mount; one of your mounts is going to waste. Can't use 2 mounts at 1 time. So, either the mount you worked so damn hard to buy or quest for is rotting away in bank or this raptor is; with the exception of when you want pull this one out to stroll around a city and feel like your impressing everyone because it just &quot;looks cool&quot;. Real good reason to deprive someone without an epic mount...why would you want to do that? I'd be happy if a party member without an epic mount got a break...and as far as &quot;rolling just because it drops so rarely&quot;...I know of tons of epic cloth items that drop rarely. Should everyone roll on those items because any class can use the item and it just looks cool? Non-clothies wouldn't get any real benefit other than the aesthetic appeal; just like people with epic mounts who rolled for epic mounts.You can disagree with this post all you want, but people who have epics mounts and then roll for epic mounts don't NEED them. So, it comes down to being greedy. Whether you find being greedy a bad thing or not means sh*t. Just stop with all the justification and be honest:You just WANT IT. O' yeah...if your playing this game just for &quot;Loot and Content&quot; go play a single player game. Point of MMORPG is to play with other people and the enjoyment of teamwork and interacting with people.</div>

If you get to where running ZG is not worth your time cuz you have better things to do, then pay the 800 gold for the epic mount and go on with adventuring. <br /><br />Probably you will have to buy your epic mount, but unless you just cannot live with out it and the money is burning a hole in your pocket, just wait and see and maybe you will get lucky.
