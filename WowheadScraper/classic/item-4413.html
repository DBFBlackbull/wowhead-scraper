What a blast! I started by following the advice of folks and getting the white, yellow, etc., access cards. I got to blue and decided to sneak into the Engineering Labs. The -D machine was tucked in a nook on the outer rim of the center portion. Only a non-elite level 25 came close. When I unstealthed and had got the schematic, the mob attacked me, but it was an easy battle and didn't aggro anything. By then I didn't care either, as I had already got the schematics for the Minor Recombobulator and Discombobulator Ray.\n\nSo I didn't get the red access card and the -D machine still let me get the schematic. I suspect all that's needed is the Delta Access Card, which I bought on the AH.\n\nAt level 37, I could get within less than a yard of the mobs before i was detected. That happened twice when I got greedy for a chest. But the level 25 elites where not a problem and well enough spaced to avoid any adds. And they didn't run when low in health, thankfully.\n\nHorde druids should watch out not to kill flagged mobs you find before the instance.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1.) This drop is <b>NOT</b> rare.<br />2.) This is <b>NOT</b> a drop of the endboss.<br /><br />All you need to get this schematic is a 'DELTA Security card' <b>and</b> the red card that grants access to the <b>D</b>-machine near to the endboss. <br /><br /><b>This is only available for engineerw with a minimum of 160 skill points!</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First you need Delta security card. It's a low drop, so getting it is the hardest part. You can find it from AH though in some cases. The important part about delta security card is that it is not Bind on pickup, so once you have gotten your schematic, sell it forward. So.. once you have delta security card, you need to get the white punch card (drops outside the instance from gnomes and troggs), chance it to yellow card (again outside instance), and then chance the yellow card to red card (inside this time, near safe zone), then chance the red card to blue card (at that one boss in the the hanger or something), and lastly get the schematic from terminals near the final boss, in the engineering labs. <br /><br />In short: you need securyty delta access card and blue punch card to learn this schematic.<br /><br />(All above taken from memory, could be wrong or slightly incorrect).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Slightly off.<br /><br />You get the White card outside the instance as a drop. After that, get the Yellow card from a machine, also outside the instance. Once in the instance near the clean zone, get the Blue card, then in the hanger near one of the minibosses (where you get the Workshop Key), get the Red card. (Machines are on the Platform in the middle of the hanger.)<br /><br />You need Red card, DELTA card, and 160 Engineering to obtain the schematics for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just hearthed out. What a blast! I started by following the advice of folks and getting the white, yellow, etc., access cards. I got to blue and decided to sneak into the Engineering Labs. The -D machine was tucked in a nook on the outer rim of the center portion. Only a non-elite level 25 came close. When I unstealthed and had got the schematic, the mob attacked me, but it was an easy battle and didn't aggro anything. By then I didn't care either, as I had already got the schematics for the Minor Recombobulator and Discombobulator Ray.<br /><br />So I didn't get the red access card and the -D machine still let me get the schematic. I suspect all that's needed is the Delta Access Card, which I bought on the AH.<br /><br />At level 37, I could get within less than a yard of the mobs before i was detected. That happened twice when I got greedy for a chest. But the level 25 elites where not a problem and well enough spaced to avoid any adds. And they didn't run when low in health, thankfully.<br /><br />Horde druids should watch out not to kill flagged mobs you find before the instance. I did that once when trying to get the white card and some trash alliance &quot;skull&quot; players promptly killed me.<br /><br />What really helped was the map. It took me a while to figure out that I needed to go through the Clean Room to get to the Clockworks area. Also, don't unstealth in the Clean Room. The elites there are not friendly to Horde, I discovered.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Don´t really know what i´m doing wrong... i´ve killed at least 200 addled lepers which are supposed to drop the white punch card, but i never get it. Not from other mobs in or outside the instance either. Are you supposed to have a certain quest to get the drop? Please help me.....<br />Jeena, lvl 43 troll shaman</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I always miss out on the cool things, leveling my Engineering too fast, by the time I have this Schematic: I doubt I'll level off it. /cry<br />But, I'll still make it! lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You don't need the Data Rescue quest to get the punchcards. You just need to farm the gnomes and troggs outside the instance to get the WHITE punchcard.<br />The DELTA Access Card is a green item which only can be looted by one person at a time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>is the security DELTA access card something that is only lootable by 1 person? If im an engineer, and another engineer both go to get the schematic, can we both get it from the same mob (low %, dont wanna have to get 2 different ones), or will it be first to loot it gets it? thx.<br /><br />Spoink, troll(M) 47shaman Dethecus<br />Spoinkette, undead(F) 28mage Dethecus</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is this a Gnomish (only) Engineer Schematic? or can Goblin Engineers use this as well?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>We went on a run yesterday and also killed everything outside of instance and around halls ... never to see Punchcard drop. I've done this quest a number of times as have those I was with. Now, we assumed after about 30 minutes of farming that it was an Alliance only quest? Can anyone shed more light on this as I'll be returning, but want to be sure it's even possible for Horde before spending each and every day pulling my hair out.<br />Thanks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kyphosis</b></h3>There's been so much confusion and misinformation it took me a while to filter it. Here's what you have to do in <b>Classic</b> to learn this recipe. I just did it myself. <b>This is not a boss drop</b>.<br /><ol><li>Kill Gnomeregan mobs until you get a <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9327/security-delta-data-access-card">Security DELTA Data Access Card</a>. The highest chance is from <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6232/arcane-nullifier-x-21">Arcane Nullifiers</a>, mainly in the corridor down to the last boss <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7800/mekgineer-thermaplugg">Thermaplugg</a>. Alternatively you can buy it from the Auction House (and you can also sell yours after using it)</li><li>Go to the Engineering Labs. It's the small corridor that stems from the one taking you to Thermaplugg (which also leads to the back door, and where you can find the boss <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6229/crowd-pummeler-9-60">Crowd Pummeler 9-60</a>)</li><li>Use one of the D card reader machines there</li></ol><br /><b>No other cards are needed</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>YESIMTHEBOSS</b></h3>1. Farm or buy this <a href="/classic/item=9327/security-delta-data-access-card">Security DELTA Data Access Card</a><br />2. Kill <a href="/classic/npc=6229/crowd-pummeler-9-60">Crowd Pummeler 9-60</a><br />3. Go down the elevator<br />4. Somewhere between the cracks of the huge object in the middle of the room is this device <a href="/classic/object=142696/matrix-punchograph-3005-d">Matrix Punchograph 3005-D</a><br />5. Use it &amp; go through the text which will eventually TEACH you how to craft the <a href="/classic/item=4388/discombobulator-ray">Discombobulator Ray</a><br /><br />Note: You will not receive a schematic but instead learn how to craft it so make sure you have 160 in engineering.<br />Good luck!</div>
