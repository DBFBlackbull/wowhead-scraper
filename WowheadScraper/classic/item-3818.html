<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, so if you are a herbalist, which area does it 'grow' in most?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Fadeleaf is found almost exclusively under bushes and around other plants, and it's very easy to miss, so the best bet is to have on &quot;find herbs&quot; at all times, hoping the little &quot;fadeleaf&quot; blot comes up. Sure, it's distinct from other pickable herbs, but especially in Stranglethorn, everything begins to blend together.<br /><br />Where to find it -<br /><br />Stranglethorn Vale - it's everywhere, and the mobs are low level. Especially in tree/mob-dense areas, it's fairly common.<br /><br />Arathi Highlands - Look in the surrounding areas of the four binding circles. But of course, these places are also hotbeds for both sides, so it's best to be ready for a rogue or some-such to come at you in the middle of it.<br /><br />Swamp of Sorrows - you absolutely must go here as an herbalist - blindweed falls off the trees and fadeleaf is everywhere. Very, very common.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>a great place to farm for fadeleaf is in arathi highlands near the circle of inner binding, im a rogue alch/herb so, i dont sell this stuff!<br /><br />instead if anyof my rogue giuldies need blinding powder i send them some, people charge way to much for this plant. its fairly common. more common than wild steelbloom, if you know where to look. after spending 30 minutes in arathi highlands i got 23 fadeleaf, and made some lesser invisiblility potions, and some blinding powder. <br />i dont understand how they charge soo much money for fadeleaf.... <br /><br />Vwooshman lvl 34 rogue, maxed out at 225 in alch and herbalism, &quot;cant even drink my own potions&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All instances have a nerf that prevents farming, if you enter an instance more than 5 times in quick succession you are banned from entering any instance for one hour... and yes this includes BGs and other instances, not just the one you were farming. Just so's you all know (My friend borrowed my account to farm for ghost mushrooms in maraudon as his herbalism was too low, after the 5th reset it wouldnt let him back in and it actually came up in chat log saying so) :(<br /><br />Dramoriga, 60 mage<br />Lysannis, 36 Rogue<br />Bloodhoof</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yea, I thought about the SM thing... I could probably go farm it there 5 resets and then more elsewhere for an hour. Then go back. =D</div>

If no one buys at the prices being asked, the prices come down, regardless of rarity. THAT'S economics.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hmm let's see...<br /><br />First of all, because lots of people want them!<br /><br />Second of all, because many of the people who want the items did not choose a profession that would allow them to gather the items themselves.<br /><br />Third, and most importantly... Because you go play BG's instead of getting the damn things yourself! Then you have the nerve to gripe and complain about those who took the time out of their play time to go on uber-exciting herb gathering runs instead of stuff that is actually fun to do. <br /><br />So change your profession, gather your own, or keep paying high prices to those who collect it!<br /><br />Thank you for your gold. Please drive through to the next window. Have a nice day. Come again! lol ;0)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wwndata.net shows about 9 high spawn rate fadeleaf plants in duskwood</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>About 20g per stack on Burnig Legion atm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok I agree that it shouldn't be 20g a stack. I also agree that it takes alot of work to get the high enough level, and time to gather this herb. But what I don't understand is why people argue. If you think that this herb is not worth 20g a stack the logical thing is not to buy it. No ifs, ands, or buts. If you think this is a good price then buy it. But if you think you can do anything about it, you can't. Rogues NEED this item. Sure you can win a fight without it. But theres other rogues that will win 3 at a time with it. It is an ability, just like teleport, and Blessing of Kings, they all have Reagents. This is only expensive because of the fact that it isn't the easiest thing to find, not everybody can find it, and you can't buy it from a reagent vendor. So don't complain about the price, If you were a herbalist and had a stack of these I doubt that you would put it in any less than 10g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was gathering Mageweave Cloth to help a friend raise tailoring, and I discovered that Blinding Power can be found in the lockboxes you can pickpocket off the pirates in Lost Rigger Cove (South-east of Gadgetzan in Tanaris). I did a test, and this is what I came up with:<br /><br />Out of 100 pickpocket attempts, 61 had lockboxes. Rogue related contents (not including money or other items) of the lockboxes were...<br /><br />19 Essence of Agony<br />14 Dust of Deterioration<br />11 Blinding Power<br />11 Dust of Decay<br />2 Fadeleaf<br /><br />It took roughly 70 minutes to collect this data. Averages out to be 1 Blinding Powder every 4 minutes 30 seconds.<br /><br />Overall, not a very good place to &quot;farm&quot; Blinding Power, but if you don't have any other way to get it (herbalism) and you don't have the money to buy it, it might be the next best thing.<br /><br />Note that the drops will probably becomparable on all Sturdy Junkboxes. I merely used Lost Rigger Cove for my testing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why you see the price is so high is because this stuff is in such high demand; Whenever the price is lower then usual -- it's sells instantly.&nbsp; I have been able to purchase fadeleaf for about 40s each -- but at very early hours.&nbsp; I've also lucked out with bidding very low and winning 1 or 2 at a time (again usually in the wee hours of the night.) <br /><br />As a rogue - blinding powder is a must for PVP. Seeing the cost of Fadeleaf was so high, I dropped Engineering (which was at 260 at the time) -- switched to Herbs + took 5 hours building up my herb skills. You only need 160 to pick Fadeleaf, which I found in Stranglethorn and Swamp of Sorrows. To me -- it's well worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On my server there was 1 main supplier I bought my fadeleaf from in the AH. A month ago it was costing me 6g a stack. A week later is was 8g. A week later is was 12g with a couple others with lower prices. Now the average cost is about 15-16g a stack from the same person and there are 3 or 4 other regular suppliers on there around the same price.<br /><br />Luckily I decided a while ago that 8g was too much to dish out all the time so I started a warlock herbalist before the price rose further. I now have more fadeleaf than my rogue can handle but I definitely won't be selling it in the AH for the amount they're charging now.</div>
