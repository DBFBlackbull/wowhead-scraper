<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those attempting to get to the chest, here's a very easy way to do it (I just soloed my way down as a 43 druid)<br /><br />(76,45) <br />Clear your way on to the furthest boat. Pull the mob from top level by stairs out to the deck and kill him. Then go down and pull by line-of-sight and only one will come. <br /><br />&quot;what if I pull the entire ship? AHH&quot;<br />no need to panic. simply head to the deck and cross over to the other ship. the mobs cannot cross ships and will stop attacking you, so you can heal up and avoid death.<br /><br />Chest had a crappy green for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Like others have pointed out, this chest re-spawns within about 5 seconds. Grinding on the beach, I took 4 keys with me (because the key is unique, you can only have one in inventory at a time, but you can carry others inside of the boxes, so it is easy to have a bunch of these at once).<br /><br />Its a nice change of scenery if you're grinind the beach, and the green drops are good for disenchanting and the occasional good AH listing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>That was the dumbest thing ever. I got to the chest and used my key to open it, only to find out that some ? horde had looted it before me. All that was left was a wooden leg.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Had about 6-7 of them in 2 days, around 40g worth of loot ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're in the 40's or 50's, this is the best grinding spot available. First, grind on the pirates near the ships for as long as you can, you can stack multiple Pirate junkboxes so that you have multiple Captain's keys. While getting the junkboxes, you'll get a good amount of mageweave as well. inside the Chest, you'll find a green or 2 with some money, today i found a BoE blue (Wirt's third Leg, sold for 30g) now, also inside the pirates junkbox is sometimes a piece of a map fragment, keep farming these until u have 3+ complete maps. after you do that, right click the map to start a quest to find this treasure chest, &quot;Cuergo's gold&quot;. swim south to the far south east tip of Tanaris, theres a place where u can summon these 5 pirates to fight that are guarding the treasure, theres always something good in that box. as soon as your done, right click the next map you have to start the quest again. i do this a lot, and i get so much loot from killing the pirates (mageweave) unlocking the captain's chest, and the Cuergo's gold chest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got 14s 67c, a head rag (gray), and Huntsman's Shoulders of the Boar (green)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went through all the effort as a 44 lock soloing it (didn't die once :) ) and got some crap stuff from the chest. Imo..the only reason worth doing it is for the xp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jfoobar</b></h3>As indicated below, this is on the second ship. Specifically, it is one level down from the deck (middle level) in the bow of the ship. You do not need to cross the middle level to the opposite stairs or go to the lower level at all. You will probably have to fight two mobs at once a couple of times to get to it but with careful pulling should not be any worse than that. <br /><br />There is also a dented footlocker that spawns on the deck of the ship but that is a rogue-only thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rhelan</b></h3>This does not (in Classic), as one might expect, fit in your KEYRING.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>book67</b></h3>You can do this as a Priest by mind controlling one of the pirates, and getting it to near death, then cancelling the mind control and hitting it with a quick pain while you run away.<br />The rest of the group will not be linked, so as they chase you, you can Pain another one to extend it's leash, then when the rest reset, you can finish off that one.<br />This way you can eliminate 2 pirates each pull.<br />At the start, two pirates come in separately from the group. You can handle those at the start.<br />So, out of 7 pirates total, you can kill them in 3 groups of two, then the last one is easy to finish off.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sugardaddy</b></h3>Just ran in and looted it since a mage aoe cleared. easy loot. be ready for respawns if you do try to follow after a mage.<br /><br />got a 14 slotter, wooden leg and a parrot skeleton.</div>
