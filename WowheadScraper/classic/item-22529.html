<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>362</b></h3>I used to farm in Un'Goro for Savage Fronds, but I recently started taking a liking to Felwood better. The mobs seem to be more compact and there's also Water Elementals nearby that have a chance to drop some Core of Elements (if you're going for the Insignias, this is another turn-in item). You can also get living / water essences from these two mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3052</b></h3>Dire Maul East is great for these and living essences.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>they also fall in felwood from the tree elementals but i think its a low drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I decided to try and get these fronds off of Bloodpetal dudes in Un'Goro.<br /><br />When I started out killing the level 51-52 guys, my drop rate was 3/8.<br /><br />When I moved east and killed the level 48-49 guys, that rate changed to 0/10.<br /><br />I had the quest &quot;Savage Flora&quot; when I killed them but I don't think that makes a difference for this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So far - Felwood seems to be the best place to farm these. Not only are the mobs easy as pie, lvl 52-53 - but you also get the odd Living Essence from them as well. Plus, pretty decent droprate - got 40 of them in just over an hour.<br />Another upside is that you don`t have to fear being munched by Devilsaurs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Best place to farm those is AH. Goes for around 4-4,5g per 30 on my server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i have been aoe farming these in DM east, but now it looks as if they have changed the droprate to 0%. i was getting about 100 or so per hour, now i have cleared it 4 times and gotten not a single frond... anyone know what is going on? where else can i go that is easy to aoe grind but still has such a good drop rate?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i've found the actual drop rate in un'goro seems to be about 1 in 5 or 1 in 6, depending on where you're killing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I agree, the droprates in felwood are a lot higher than the percents shown here. I usually farm the elemental horrers, and while waiting for them to respawn, I kill some of the trees, I say you will get 3 fronds per 5 guys you kill. I have farmed here several dozen times, and this is just a median</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Assuming revered reputation, you need 2,700 of these to get an epic item. At a 30% drop rate (approx), you have to kill 9,000 mobs. You're looking at a decent 75-90 hours of farming here from a statistical point of view. My friend got his in 2 days with DM farming, but that got the nerfstick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got mine finished. Blackhand server. Affliction locks are gonna be seriously dissapointed. Syhpon life and drain life will not add charges to the buff. I respecced destruction just so I could use this trinket I farmed so much for. Hope its a bug *shrug*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Trees in Felwood got higher chance then shown... i get 1 in like 2-3 Tree's and they also got a slight chance of Dropping Living Essence</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farmed a couple hundred today, drop rate on the Irontree was almost exactly 25%. Was getting about 35-40 per hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I aoe farm dm east for these, about 4/5 per pack of lashers, 250so far in 2h30mins</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Yhw0Fermeli</b></h3>Savage fond also drop on Irontree Stomper in Felwood (WoW Classic).<br /><br />Core of Element also drop from the water elemental in Felwood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dasbaum</b></h3>Clearing all treants in the first room of DM West with a 5 man group takes about 8-10min and nets ~45 <a href="/classic/item=22529/savage-frond">Savage Frond</a> on average per reset</div>
