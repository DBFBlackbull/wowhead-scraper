And just fish till you have 75 fishing (an Intelect buff of any kind helps this along faster). Once fishing hits 75 go learn the next level and return to Lushwater\/WC to fish until 150. Keep all the Longjaw Mudsnappers and Bristlewhisker Catfish for later.  You should alternately catch Brilliant Smallfish, Longjaws, Bristle Whiskers and Deviate Fish.  The Deviates sell extremly well in AH (2-5G per 20 stack on my server). You can pick up the Savory Deviate Suprise recipe above WC (Cooked deviates also sell well in AH). The rest become cooking fodder. Cook Smallfish until you are 75. Though you might have to suppliment with farming Strider meat, which is ok Strider Stew gives a decent low level buff.\n\nOnce cooking is up to 75 cook all the Longjaws you've caught until you're either maxed at 150 or the skill is grey.  At which point cook Bristlewhiskers to finish cooking 150.  After that you will have both fishing and cooking maxed till you can get the appropriate training books for both skills.  The whole process took me about an hour to max both skills to 150 and make about 15 gold selling deviate fish.\n\nEdited, Thu Dec 15 00:52:46 2005","date":"2005-12-13T00:52:07-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Just one small clarification- You can go ahead and train Journeyman Fisherman when you hit 50 skill instead of waiting for 75, if you happen to be leaving your favorite fishing hole during that time period for some reason.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So, let's compare: as Alliance, you can buy and use the Expert Cooking book at L20, in an area that is pretty easy to reach for L20 characters. As Horde, however, you have to find a way to get your L20 character to a town that is accessible overland only after first passing through the Charred Vale (heaps of L25-30 mobs and no safe roadway), followed by a long hike through an area where L33-L38 mobs cross the road constantly, and aggro on anything that even *smells* like it's below L30. Basically, if an L20 Hordie wants this book, it's either AH, twink, or have a friend buy a copy for you - unless you're really into corpse runs. About your best odds of success are with a Shaman, using Ghost Wolf, and praying that you can dodge as you run.</div>

I recommend the little strip of land between the two pools for safe fishing, or the brave/strong can venture into Wailing Caverns and fish from the rock in the middle of the pool before the instance portal (also a safe spot once you can reach it). And just fish till you have 75 fishing (an Intelect buff of any kind helps this along faster). Once fishing hits 75 go learn the next level and return to Lushwater/WC to fish until 150. Keep all the Longjaw Mudsnappers and Bristlewhisker Catfish for later. You should alternately catch Brilliant Smallfish, Longjaws, Bristle Whiskers and Deviate Fish. The Deviates sell extremly well in AH (2-5G per 20 stack on my server). You can pick up the Savory Deviate Suprise recipe above WC (Cooked deviates also sell well in AH). The rest become cooking fodder. Cook Smallfish until you are 75. Though you might have to suppliment with farming Strider meat, which is ok Strider Stew gives a decent low level buff.<br /><br />Once cooking is up to 75 cook all the Longjaws you've caught until you're either maxed at 150 or the skill is grey. At which point cook Bristlewhiskers to finish cooking 150. After that you will have both fishing and cooking maxed till you can get the appropriate training books for both skills. The whole process took me about an hour to max both skills to 150 and make about 15 gold selling deviate fish.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Dec 15 00:52:46 2005</div>

    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
