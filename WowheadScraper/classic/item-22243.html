Ever tried to get 40 people all in the same place at the same time, when everyone was just out and about doing their own thing?&nbsp; I GUARANTEE you that there will be at least a few folks at the start of the raid that will need to be summoned.&nbsp; And every one of those summons uses up a soul shard.\n\n2) SUMMONING DURING THE RAID.&nbsp; The out-of-guild mage just pulled aggro and wiped the raid again, and has been kicked out; or maybe one of your guildmates had a family emergency.&nbsp; There's now a space in the raid that needs to be filled.&nbsp; How do you get your new raid member to where you are without waiting all day?&nbsp; That's right, you summon him.&nbsp; Which takes a soul shard.&nbsp; And what happens when your guildmate falls off the waterfall in Zul'Gurub and the only path leading back to you is full of Elite mobs you haven't killed?&nbsp; That's right, you summon him.&nbsp; Which takes a soul shard.\n\n3) GETTING OUT THE RIGHT PET FOR EACH BOSS FIGHT.&nbsp; Every raid boss requires different strategy to bring down.&nbsp; For some, you'll need your Voidwalker.&nbsp; For others, you'll need your Felhunter.&nbsp; For still others, you might need an Infernal.&nbsp; And each of these is going to take a soul shard to summon.&nbsp; (And did I mention that some demons need to be Enslaved?&nbsp; Soul shard again.)\n\n4) DEATH.&nbsp; Did I mention how often you'll die in a raid?&nbsp; Trust me, you will.&nbsp; Some boss fights or tough pulls require only one slip-up by one raid member, and boom, down you'll all go.&nbsp; To allow a smooth recovery from a wipe, you'll want to have a soulstone on one of the rezzers in your raid, and that takes a soul shard.&nbsp; And when you get resurrected, you'll almost certainly have to summon your pet again, which consumes -- you guessed it -- another soul shard.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the shards you'll burn to be effective in the PvP battlegrounds....","date":"2006-09-17T16:11:53-05:00","rating":64,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Don't forget this one.\n\n[b] Health Stones and Mana Stones [\/b]\n\nThere are times when half your raid will want them.","creationdate":"2007-01-05T04:11:53-06:00","id":1163528,"rating":37,"commentid":2668612,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Unknown","importedSubject":"Health and Mana Stones"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"rogermw","importedSubject":"When having lots of shards becomes worth it."},{"commentv2":1,"number":16,"id":2668635,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Ok, what I want to say is we are discussing about \"small soul pouches\", not about the one's with more slots at higher levels.My point is that those Pouches are really cool and can be of great use to a Warlock, but do you really think that a level 20 that can choose a 12slot bag that can contain any object over a 12 slot that can contain only one type of object, will take a soulbag.\nYes indeed when you compare the 16-18slot bags with the 28 slot soulbags it's kinda obvious who's the winner in this situation, but then again the greatest advantage of a soulbag imo is the amount of soulshards you can have in them, which can be fully used only at higher levels.\nYes, I'm gonna get me one, once i reach 40-60, but for now, small soul puch<normal bag","date":"2006-10-24T04:11:53-05:00","rating":11,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ConfusedMage","importedSubject":"\"Small Soul Pouch\""},{"commentv2":1,"number":17,"id":2668651,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Why does evryone say the are poor,\nI have a lvl 20 lock and it has already 26G.\n\nAll i did was completing all the q's in the Ghostlands.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6732</b></h3>A Horde warlock can complete both the Undead and Orc versions of this quest for TWO Small Soul Pouches. They cannot be equipped simultaneously, however the second pouch can be put in a bank slot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nolimit</b></h3>No they don't disappear, lol that would be stupid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6984</b></h3>They don't disappear, but they don't stack either. This is why you need big bags :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>From the succubus quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its pretty good considering that at level 20 most bags are like 8-10 slot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As far as I can work out I have to equip this in one of by bag slots... Problem being it can ONLY hold soul shards. A regular 10 slot can hold soul shards and regular items too so what's the point?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>all of you quit fighting, i have a 60 lock, getting a shard bag is worth it, and if you dont have one get one, its that simple, spend the little money you have, get the bag, and get used to holding shards, you will learn that through out your endeavors that 20, or 24 slots wont cut it, thats why when you get to 60 (or sooner depening on if you can buy the core leather off the AH) you get the 28 slot soulbag&nbsp; (&nbsp; <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52466&nbsp;">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52466&nbsp;</a> &nbsp; )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thottbot shows getting this thing from the Succy quests in Org and SW, but not from the one in the UC. Just nobody with cosmos did it since soulbags came out?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This really sucks because my warlock is level 22 and i completed the succubus quest a little while before the soul bags were released. Is there any way for me to get a soul bag without having to spend 5+ gold (which I am far from having yet) at the Auction House to buy one?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>tailors can make these bags, but alot better than this one. once you get to tailoring skill 235 i think, then you can make your own 20 slot bags, shich is alot bigger than any other normal bag you can get. if you have a friend on wow or youre a tailor yourself, you could make one and use it (theres no level requirement)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>okay that guy who said soulshard pouches are a waste.....im sorry but ur an IDIOT! their awsome...whenever u create a shard, it automaticlly stores it for u!&nbsp; and plus it tells u how many u have...so u know when u needa restock...and btw...locks shouldnt' be the poor class... we get the free mount =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, but what if the Warlock is like completely <u>broke</u>? What then? Sell all they have? I've looked for a SSB(soul shard bag)but they're all like... 3g! =O And that doesn't quite work for a 19 warlock.<br /><br />+ How do you get this SSB from Succubus quest, huh?<br /><br />☺Distressed<br />☺Confused<br />☺Crazy<br />☺Help!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>soul bags are great. why you ask?<br /><br />they hold more shards than normal bags (the exception being a bottomless bag, which are uber expensive) and are way cheaper than regular bags. being able to get a bag that can hold 20 shards (as apposed to a regular bag which only has 16 slots) for a third of the price is well worth the investment (and since its free, there is no investment!), especially because soul shards are such an imperetive reagent. almost everything requires them!<br /><br />so for those of you who think that soul bags are useless, delete your lock and roll something else because if you cant understand a basic lock gameplay mechanic, you dont deserve to be playing one.<br /><br />and to those of you who dont have enough money, what the hell have you been spending it on? locks get better loot from drops than on the AH. when i was lvl 20 i had 15g+. now at 32 i have 115. im planning on getting a felcloth bag, its definately worth the 40g, especially since there isnt much else that money is going to go towards.<br /><br />EDIT: does that say this comment is scored at 1000? how in the hell?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I cannot believe that you guys are arguing so much over a bag...&nbsp; I have started playing my first lock and at the current level of 17 I have not had much need for a soul pouch, but looking at the talent tree that is going to change.&nbsp; I would say that while grouping I do seem to end up cluttering my bags with them and the only way to tell is to look in the bags, annoying, or check to see if the viodwalker or any other spell is active, indicating that I have a shard.&nbsp; It is certainly irritating when my walker dies and i do not have and shards.&nbsp; <br /><br />So maybe I can see the point of both sides and the need for the soul bag increases as you level.&nbsp; At this point in my character, I only have two things that require a shard so why have a bag just for them?&nbsp; But later, who knows I just might need one, I do not know.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can tell you one thing, I am going to stick that free one in the bank and test to see how I do with it and without and base my decision on that.&nbsp; <br /><br />For you guys who are complaining about money, I would suggest that you address your skills.&nbsp; I have well of 15K and I have been only playing this guy for a week.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is true that while you are levelling, having a large cache of soul shards is not terribly useful.<br /><br />However, when you hit level 60 and start to go on RAID DUNGEONS, you will burn through soul shards like there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />1) SUMMONING TO START THE RAID.&nbsp; Ever tried to get 40 people all in the same place at the same time, when everyone was just out and about doing their own thing?&nbsp; I GUARANTEE you that there will be at least a few folks at the start of the raid that will need to be summoned.&nbsp; And every one of those summons uses up a soul shard.<br /><br />2) SUMMONING DURING THE RAID.&nbsp; The out-of-guild mage just pulled aggro and wiped the raid again, and has been kicked out; or maybe one of your guildmates had a family emergency.&nbsp; There's now a space in the raid that needs to be filled.&nbsp; How do you get your new raid member to where you are without waiting all day?&nbsp; That's right, you summon him.&nbsp; Which takes a soul shard.&nbsp; And what happens when your guildmate falls off the waterfall in Zul'Gurub and the only path leading back to you is full of Elite mobs you haven't killed?&nbsp; That's right, you summon him.&nbsp; Which takes a soul shard.<br /><br />3) GETTING OUT THE RIGHT PET FOR EACH BOSS FIGHT.&nbsp; Every raid boss requires different strategy to bring down.&nbsp; For some, you'll need your Voidwalker.&nbsp; For others, you'll need your Felhunter.&nbsp; For still others, you might need an Infernal.&nbsp; And each of these is going to take a soul shard to summon.&nbsp; (And did I mention that some demons need to be Enslaved?&nbsp; Soul shard again.)<br /><br />4) DEATH.&nbsp; Did I mention how often you'll die in a raid?&nbsp; Trust me, you will.&nbsp; Some boss fights or tough pulls require only one slip-up by one raid member, and boom, down you'll all go.&nbsp; To allow a smooth recovery from a wipe, you'll want to have a soulstone on one of the rezzers in your raid, and that takes a soul shard.&nbsp; And when you get resurrected, you'll almost certainly have to summon your pet again, which consumes -- you guessed it -- another soul shard.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the shards you'll burn to be effective in the PvP battlegrounds....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, what I want to say is we are discussing about &quot;small soul pouches&quot;, not about the one's with more slots at higher levels.My point is that those Pouches are really cool and can be of great use to a Warlock, but do you really think that a level 20 that can choose a 12slot bag that can contain any object over a 12 slot that can contain only one type of object, will take a soulbag.<br />Yes indeed when you compare the 16-18slot bags with the 28 slot soulbags it's kinda obvious who's the winner in this situation, but then again the greatest advantage of a soulbag imo is the amount of soulshards you can have in them, which can be fully used only at higher levels.<br />Yes, I'm gonna get me one, once i reach 40-60, but for now, small soul puch&lt;normal bag</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why does evryone say the are poor,<br />I have a lvl 20 lock and it has already 26G.<br /><br />All i did was completing all the q's in the Ghostlands. I must even finish The Traitor's Destruction. Though my lvl 32 Night elf Priest doesn't even have 2G....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone know if <u><b>two pouches of diffrent kinds </b> </u> (eg. herb pouch &amp; soul pouch) can be used at the same time? I would hate to spend the time and glue to to find out my self.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>looks like this is a new bonus reward for the succi quest... 12 slot bag is pretty nice at lvl 20 :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If the Soul Pouches cold be kept in another container and still hold shards, this would definitely be worth it. But they aren't, so what's the point?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What is the use for this bag. I was in wc today and my inventory was full and I checked this bag and all the slots were empty?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ugh.. had to pay 5g for the 20 slot vrsion onn AH, didnt know ther was somehting like this out there...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>its says you van buy it somewhere, but where</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone have some more info on this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok you can get this for 10s from a vendor so why do people charge 20g for this in the aucction house</div>
