If you want to keep it and not have the quest sitting there in your quest list just don't accept the next stage of the quest at the shrine when you receive this. If you to decide you want to finish the quest later you can always go back to the shirne and pick it back up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Blacktalis</b></h3>This quest starts at Raene Wolfwood in Astrannar, a chain for the, non-official, reward of the famous Furbolg Transformation!!<br /><br />The first quest she will give you, 'Raene's Cleansing' will get you scouting for a Gem and a friend.<br />The poor sop will be found rotting,,<br />The gem is located in the middle of Lake Falathim on a random Murloc, 20,43. <br /><br />Next quest will be ' An Aggressive Defense'<br />You will need to kill <br />Foulweald Den Watcher: 0/1 <br />Foulweald Ursa: 0/2 <br />Foulweald Totemic: 0/10 <br />Foulweald Warrior: 0/12 <br />These are located at 49,61.<br />Then return to Raene Wolfwood.<br /><br />You will then get 'Culling the Threat',<br />which requires you to go kill Dal Bloodclaw and bring back his skull. Roughly around 38,34.<br /><br />Once you have done this, the chain will continue on, but you will be provided with Dartol's Rod of Transformation!!!<br /><br />Dartols Rod of Transformation has a cooldown of 1 min, and no lvl req. It will transform you into a Furbolg, but when you are hit you will lose the disguise. This does not prevent other furbolgs from attacking you and neither can you talk to them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if you do the very last part of quest after talking to the furbolg twice, he sends you back to Raene in astranaar with the boss furbolg's skull. If you turn in the skull you also lose the rod.<br /><br />So I abandonned the last quest part and kept the rod. It's so much fun. It's unlimited use. The avatar isn't fully done so it doesn't do any of the emotes and if you take damage you change back but its still loads of fun. You can fight in form and stay that way till you take damage. Avatar does go into a fighting position and takes out his weapon though shield doesn't appear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is better for a caster who has good aggro management - you can stay in disguise and cast all your spells (the casting animations still happen at the fingertips, etc) for the entire fight and still look cool. And if ever you revert back to normal model you know you must have taken damage and it's time to change your tactics. For mages with Manashield or priests with PWShield you can hold firbolg form for 3 minutes. Pity you can't catch a griff or use your mount while shapeshifted - that would look awesome.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There no longer appears to be a limited number of charges associated with this item.&nbsp; It was originally limited to five uses.<br /><br />It trasnforms you into a furblog for 3 minutes, but has only a one minute cooldown, so you can keep it up more-or-less continuously (if you try to re-cast it before it times out then it just turns the effect off but does not start the cooldown so you can just re-activate it at that point).<br /><br />Casting time is about 2-2.5 seconds.&nbsp; You can cast it while moving.<br /><br />You cannot ride a mount while shapeshifted.<br /><br />You can stealth and the furblog will stealth, druids can switch to travel form and the furblog will run really fast.&nbsp; Basically behaves like the Ogre Suit in terms of how it interacts with other skills.<br /><br />In its improved (no more limited charges) form, this is an incredibly cool item that may very well get nerfed (perhaps with a much longer cooldown) but at the moment it's way more fun than the quest that you would have to turn it in for.&nbsp; I had put mine in the bank with only one charge remaining and was about to throw it out until I noticed that the charges indicator was gone.<br /><br />F.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hmm, before it had 5 charges, so i turned it in for XP, now it has unlimited charges.&nbsp; Blizzard, i feel really unfair about this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When Furbolged, will I aggro other furbolgs?<br /><br />I.e. is the rod a &quot;get through the Moonglade tunnel for free&quot; -card? ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My 1 question is...<br /><br />IS THERE NE LOVE FOR THE HORDE IN THIS QUEST?<br /><br />aka. can horde get the rod somehow also?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The rod is a reward from one of the quests in Raene's Cleansing. If you continue on with the quest chain, you lose the item, so I abandoned the quest and kept the staff. =) It turns you into a standard looking furbolg for 3 minutes, and has a 45 second cooldown. You can attack enemies while in the form, but revert back if you take damage. (You take out your weapon, but for some reason it dose'nt show the shield.) You can't Take a hippogryph or griffon while shapeshifted. Enjoy! =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where is the final part? I hope I don't have to go back in that barrow again. I killed all those undead druids once. East of the road does not help much, or am I really missing something in plain sight?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this rod as a lvl 21 Druid and it is AWESOME! Its like a whole nother form exept it lasts 3 min. but u can just go right back in it. Its cool u can use all your spells abilities I wouldve wanted an Undead with this see how Canabalizm looks like.Only thing that I wanted to see is that u wouldnt attract aggro from other Furlborgs with this on -_-. Cool anyways :D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just got 1 question: WHERE DO I GET THE QUEST!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karpata</b></h3>I can CONFIRM that Item Restoration works for this in classic.<br /><br />If you destroy the item at least once, abandon the quest and pick it back up you can just restore the item once you're done with the chain and got you Glacial Spike.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>newBlock</b></h3>I can confirm this rod works in Classic WoW. To keep the rod just don't accept the quest after <a href="/classic/quest=1028/raenes-cleansing">Raene's Cleansing</a> (the part where you get the rod from the <a href="/classic/object=19024/hidden-shrine">Hidden Shrine</a>). It does work outside of Ashenvale also.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>VoidsReacher</b></h3>Are there any similar items to this? I mean quest items that have strange and funny abilities that are lost after quest is complete?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Snektopus</b></h3>As a Paladin or Priest(The casting effect of this toy is the yellow glowy) you can bait out interrupts in pvp with this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bonzybabee</b></h3>Found today that you can break the Trick effect from Trick or Treating at Innkeepers with this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pschwaab</b></h3>Note: the delete item, and item restoration that seemingly worked in classic no longer works in classic tbc. I tried it, deleting the item before the last quest and then using item restoration, it never pops up in item restoration. I even tried contacting a GM who confirmed for me this item is no longer eligible for item restoration. So sadly I missed out on furbolg anytime 😭</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Planet</b></h3>I just found a way to keep the rod in your inventory, but not have the quest take up space in your quest log. Simply do not accept <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1029/raenes-cleansing">Raene's Cleansing (6)</a> from Raene Wolfrunner.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hrathen</b></h3>I spoke with a GM regarding the missing item. This item has been mass deleted from all accounts as part of cleanup just recently. Was never intended to be kept. So we can no longer restore it, especially for those who have not logged in for more than 1 months, the data is purged from their systems.<br /><br />This is on retail</div>
