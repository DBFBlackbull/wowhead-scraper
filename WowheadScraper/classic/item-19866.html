The guild I run with has a zero-sum dkp system, and I was like 7th or 8th in line after all the warriors had a shot at it.&nbsp; So to start off I didn't roll over or outbid any fury warriors or anything like that.\n\nI currently have Dal'Rend's, and I've been second-guessing myself over accepting the MH.&nbsp; I crunched some numbers and basically what I came up with was, right now with the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's OH I'm in a bad place.&nbsp; I'll do more dps with the set bonus from Dal'Rend's.\n\nBut AFTER, if I get that offhand, my dps will skyrocket.&nbsp; I know my Sinister Strikes won't hit as hard.&nbsp; And pre-1.8 this sword would have been a joke.&nbsp; But thanks to the weapon standardization this set has become a viable option for sword rogues.&nbsp; Yeah, if you're running MC or above there's better, MUCH better, and you shouldn't waste your time on this.&nbsp; But I'm not running MC.&nbsp; I'm not even in a ZG-running guild, I just raid with them from time to time.\n\nThe white dps from this set beats out the Dal'Rends set; you can't argue that.&nbsp; You get more AP from the two blades, as well as the same amount of crit, and you get a nicer set bonus.&nbsp; And don't forget that extra attack will be proccing more often, as will poisons, since they are static % chances.&nbsp; So the only real question is, does the loss in Sinister Strike damage outweigh the gain in white dps?&nbsp; It does not, when you have both swords.&nbsp; I used a base of 653 AP since that's what I have with my current gear, and I'm assuming you have Sword Specialization maxed out as well as Dual-Wield Specialization.&nbsp; I'm also assuming you have a cheap +4 enchant on your swords.&nbsp; If you can afford better, well, it's not gonna change the results, it will just change the numbers.\n\nWhite DPS is calculated as (Attack power\/14)*weapon speed + weapon dps for mainhand.&nbsp; Multiply this total by .75 for the offhand when you have DW Spec.&nbsp; Add the two together for your total.\n\nThe Sinister Strike Damage at level 60 is calculated as Weapon Damage + (Attack Power\/14)*2.4 + 73.&nbsp; I did this twice, once assuming you \"roll\" the lowest possible for that weapon and once for the highest.&nbsp; When I give you a figure for SS dps I averaged the high and low together and divided by 4.&nbsp; I am also assuming you are spamming SS every 4 seconds (40 energy at 20 energy\/2 seconds).&nbsp; For easier calculations no finishing moves will be considered, but they all have static damage anyway except SnD which will only increase the white dps.\n\nThe total DPS is gonna be your White + your SS dps.\n\nDal'Rend's Arms add 54 attack power (50 set bonus +4 str on MH).&nbsp; This means you will have 707 AP.\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp; 163.9\nHigh Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 349.2\nLow Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 279.2\nAvg Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 314.2\nSinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 78.6\nTotal DPS:&nbsp; 242.5\n\nThe Twin Blades of the Hakkari add 68 attack power (28 on MH and 40 on OH).&nbsp; This means you will have 721 AP.\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp; 180.0\nHigh Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 310.6\nLow Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 259.6\nAverage Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 285.1\nSinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 71.3\nTotal DPS:&nbsp; 251.3\n\nWielding Warblade of the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge OH gives you 681 AP (28 AP from the MH and nothing from the OH)\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp;

It does give you guys the chance to enchant two weapons as opposed to one though.\n\nHonestly, all three classes have some good use out of it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheDood</b></h3>Godlike OH for a fury DW warrior, extremely fast speed with a nice DPS and the a very nice AP bonus makes it choice for both PvE and PvP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7735</b></h3>Amazing offhand for a combat sword rogue, as the high speed makes it great for proccing poisons, plus the AP bonus and decent DPS of it just add to the greatness.<br /><br />It is also, as Muatolin mentioned, one of the best offhand weapons for a hunter. And fang of the faceless is right there in the same instance as a great mainhand to go with it (for a hunter OR a rogue).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fact that it is so good for both rogues and hunters, the age old argument of &quot;Who gets it&quot; is only fueled by these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>29306</b></h3>there are weps in outland that are much better</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I�ll ignore the stupid 2-3 last posts and comment on some of the more intelligent further up..<br /><br />Although speed shouldnt be taken into account with the new instant attack game mechanichs (after 1.8) it doesnt meen a low max dam, high dps sword will be good for a rogues SS damage.<br /><br />Sinister Strike still does damage according to damage range (high max sword damage = high sinister strike damage) although the speed has been fixed to 2.4 speed after patch 1.8.<br /><br />For Sinister Strike I believe the formula is:<br />Weapon damage+((AP/14)*speed+SS bonus <br />Weapon damage+((AP/14)*2.4)+68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Lets compare Krol to Warblade.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm an experienced fury warrior. with the right gear fury warrior can do very well in DPS compare to MS warrior and rogues. The problem with fury is that a lot of ppl dont know how to spec it, what to do, and what to wear.&nbsp; Fury gears are very limited as well. In fact half of the best fury gears aren't even epics. This sword is by far, the best Mainhand weapon for an experienced fury warrior. For our mainhand we want a weapon as fast as possible to generate rage and better proc rate, but not a dagger b/c of the new normalize instant attack where daggers only get 1.7 speed of damage from AP, whereas 1h swords and axes get 2.4 speed from AP for our overpower and execute. By far, this is the best 1h sword/axe available to us, so for a hunter to roll for this over a fury warrior in their guild just so he can put an extra 15agility at the cost of perhaps the best weapon for the fury warrior makes me sick to my stomach.&nbsp; If i were the leader of the guild i'd make sure the hunter understand this, and if he doesnt i'd ask him politely to leave the guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The offhand is great for any rogue because the ap bonus.&nbsp; But, these swords would work fine for a sword specced combat rogue also.&nbsp; Even though your SS would be a bit soft you'd get a huge bonus from flat % based procs.&nbsp; IIP procs 30% for 130 damage, sword spec 6% for extra attack, HoJ 2% for extra attack.&nbsp; The speed will help proc those and make up for the yellow damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, first off lemme say I'm a Rogue, and I use swords in PvE for the sustained DPS and daggers in PvP for the burst dps.<br /><br />Anyone that says I would &quot;roll&quot; for this item is a retard because you don't roll in ZG, and those people should be disregarded.<br /><br />I can see how it would be easy to think this is a rogue set, but it's reallyl not that good for rogues. Sure you'll proc poison more often, or maybe get your extra swing more frequently, but the white damage on this is negigable and if you were going for that stuff a dagger with windfury would do the same white damage, probably more poison procs dual wielding daggers than this set. I'd take Dal'Rend's over these, because honestly I lose damage in a long fight because my SS hits are MUCH&nbsp; lower.<br /><br />Now, technically this would be a great weapon for a fury warrior in PvP, but in my guild, since we just started doing ZG and MC, we make PvE items a priority over PvP items. Meaning if you wanted a sword or item purely for PvP, you wouldn't get it if someone else could use it for PvE. So we'd give these to our hunters. Hunters do melee in some fights, especially against the spider boss because you gotta stay close to the spider, and also because the stats on these babies give the same things it does for rogues: increased crit chance, attack power boost.<br /><br />Now I'm going to compare this w/ Dal'Rend's Arms.<br />Dal'Rends: You get 54 AP (4 more ap from 4 str, rogues only get 1 ap per 1 str), +7 defense +100 armor (good if you pull aggro a lot), and +1% crit. <br />Hakkari: 68 AP, 1% crit, and swords +6.<br /><br />Hakkari only gives 14 more AP, which is negigable, and the swords +6 is nice, but not enough to make it an ideal rogue set. I cannot stress this enough, Hakkari does MUCH less SS damage, making this a BAD rogue set. Rogues, do the right thing. Give this to your hunter or fury war, they can do a lot more with this than you can.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a lvl 60 rogue i would say this is a fury warrior set, main hand is way&nbsp; to fast, hardly and SS dam, and thats what sword rogues are al about, get BB or something like that, easyer to get even.<br /><br />Im a dagger rogue myself, i would never even want this set, exep for the look cause that rules.<br />And hunters never melee al they do is wing clip and run, if you look at the bonus +swords you know its made for fury warriors</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;What would a Hunter do with +6 swords.&quot;<br /><br />Dude, look at any epic Hunter set.&nbsp; They are almost always given worthless set bonuses.&nbsp; The stats are great though from the weapons themself ignoring the set bonus..the normal deal for Hunters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These weapons are not a class weapon it benefits combat rogues any hunter and fury warriors i see no prob if any of those are sought after by those classes plus i mean if those drop its not a roll situation more like a dkp situation so if u have more dkp u deserve it more i dont care if yer a mage i want these for the crit chance attk power +6 to swords doesnt mean crap to me but if i pound +15 agility on both they will be awesome on my hunter those are the only things im going for in zg so i think i got a good chance gettin em im willing to waste all my dkp on them but if a rogue or fury war out dkp's me i wont have a prob and i wont say u noobs i mean how could u say that +6 sword to fury or combat rogue is good +1% crit chance is also good so is attk power if anything these sword or more beneficial to a rogue or fury war lol so quit wasting time saying HUNTER WEAPONx10000000 just start doing zg and get em</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a combat sword rogue, 20/31/0, and I just got the MH today.&nbsp; The guild I run with has a zero-sum dkp system, and I was like 7th or 8th in line after all the warriors had a shot at it.&nbsp; So to start off I didn't roll over or outbid any fury warriors or anything like that.<br /><br />I currently have Dal'Rend's, and I've been second-guessing myself over accepting the MH.&nbsp; I crunched some numbers and basically what I came up with was, right now with the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's OH I'm in a bad place.&nbsp; I'll do more dps with the set bonus from Dal'Rend's.<br /><br />But AFTER, if I get that offhand, my dps will skyrocket.&nbsp; I know my Sinister Strikes won't hit as hard.&nbsp; And pre-1.8 this sword would have been a joke.&nbsp; But thanks to the weapon standardization this set has become a viable option for sword rogues.&nbsp; Yeah, if you're running MC or above there's better, MUCH better, and you shouldn't waste your time on this.&nbsp; But I'm not running MC.&nbsp; I'm not even in a ZG-running guild, I just raid with them from time to time.<br /><br />The white dps from this set beats out the Dal'Rends set; you can't argue that.&nbsp; You get more AP from the two blades, as well as the same amount of crit, and you get a nicer set bonus.&nbsp; And don't forget that extra attack will be proccing more often, as will poisons, since they are static % chances.&nbsp; So the only real question is, does the loss in Sinister Strike damage outweigh the gain in white dps?&nbsp; It does not, when you have both swords.&nbsp; I used a base of 653 AP since that's what I have with my current gear, and I'm assuming you have Sword Specialization maxed out as well as Dual-Wield Specialization.&nbsp; I'm also assuming you have a cheap +4 enchant on your swords.&nbsp; If you can afford better, well, it's not gonna change the results, it will just change the numbers.<br /><br />White DPS is calculated as (Attack power/14)*weapon speed + weapon dps for mainhand.&nbsp; Multiply this total by .75 for the offhand when you have DW Spec.&nbsp; Add the two together for your total.<br /><br />The Sinister Strike Damage at level 60 is calculated as Weapon Damage + (Attack Power/14)*2.4 + 73.&nbsp; I did this twice, once assuming you &quot;roll&quot; the lowest possible for that weapon and once for the highest.&nbsp; When I give you a figure for SS dps I averaged the high and low together and divided by 4.&nbsp; I am also assuming you are spamming SS every 4 seconds (40 energy at 20 energy/2 seconds).&nbsp; For easier calculations no finishing moves will be considered, but they all have static damage anyway except SnD which will only increase the white dps.<br /><br />The total DPS is gonna be your White + your SS dps.<br /><br />Dal'Rend's Arms add 54 attack power (50 set bonus +4 str on MH).&nbsp; This means you will have 707 AP.<br /><br />White DPS:&nbsp; 163.9<br />High Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 349.2<br />Low Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 279.2<br />Avg Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 314.2<br />Sinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 78.6<br />Total DPS:&nbsp; 242.5<br /><br />The Twin Blades of the Hakkari add 68 attack power (28 on MH and 40 on OH).&nbsp; This means you will have 721 AP.<br /><br />White DPS:&nbsp; 180.0<br />High Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 310.6<br />Low Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 259.6<br />Average Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 285.1<br />Sinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 71.3<br />Total DPS:&nbsp; 251.3<br /><br />Wielding Warblade of the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge OH gives you 681 AP (28 AP from the MH and nothing from the OH)<br /><br />White DPS:&nbsp; 169.8<br />High Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 303.7<br />Low Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 252.7<br />Average Sinister Strike:&nbsp; 2782<br />Sinister Strike DPS:&nbsp; 69.6<br />Total DPS:&nbsp; 239.4<br /><br />This of course is before armor.&nbsp; If you really wanna get into it you can calculate the extra attack procs and poison procs but I'm not going to.<br /><br />As you can see, total dps the Hakkari blades win.&nbsp; However Dal'Rend's comes in second, which means that for now the MH has to go in the bank.&nbsp; If you have Dal'Rend's Main and Hakkari Offhand ... I dunno, this math all gave me enough of a headache so I'll leave it to someone else.&nbsp; I would imagine it would be better than the Dal'Rend's set because you are only losing 10 ap for a better blade.&nbsp; I would guess the Hakkari set would still beat it out but I don't have the numbers to back that up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First... I hate to break it to you guys, but a number of guilds, mine included, do not use DKP for 20 man instances.&nbsp; DKP is only used in MC/BWL for us, so yes, we DO in fact &quot;roll&quot; for items in ZG/AQ20... maybe next time you should have a little more vision before tossing the &quot;n00b&quot; comments out eh?<br /><br />Secondly, I could see why rogues/fury warriors would want these.&nbsp; I wouldn't argue them rolling on it at all.&nbsp; Yes there are better weapons out there... it's ZG... it's NOT one of the top instances.<br /><br />The primary reason why a hunter would want these blades has ZERO to do w/ the +6 swords.<br /><br />w/ +15 agil on both, a hunter would be pulling 128Ranged AP, and 1% to crit.&nbsp; These stats are comperable to many pairs of 1h weapons in MC/BWL for us.&nbsp; In PvP, I'd rather keep a 2h on for the larger raptor crits ect, but in raids we want the most Ranged AP we can get, and the 1% crit is just as helpful.<br /><br />There are easily better weapons out there for Fury Warriors and Rogues, but OMG they might not have access to those items (especially if thier guild is still using DKP in ZG....think about it)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I really feel like there are much better choices for Combat sword rogues out there then the main hand, however, concerning the offhand, the DPS, attack speed, and +ap are incredible for a lowbie combat rogue like me.&nbsp; I would never take the main hand from a fury warrior/ hunter, however, this off hand is a great alternitive if you dont have access to MUCH higer items, or, dont have the dal rends set (i use sword of zeal and this now).<br /><br />I almost feel that the fast attack speed and major dps would be wasted on a hunter, but, the +40 attack power is godly, so, roll away :D<br /><br />Moe.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>tell u what:<br /><br />this set is one of the best PvE equip u find for a hunter! there is absolutely no doubt about it.<br />it might even be better than anything that drops in MC - which is the brutality blade and the corehound tooth!<br /><br />taking the hakkari off and mixing it with the stuff from MC, u will see that the hakkari main is still the better choice for any hunter thue to higher RAP u get from the set!<br />mixing the MC drops with the main-hand will still give u more benefits than the MC-combo.<br />brutality and corehound tooth in combination gives a hunter (+15 agi enchant included) 98 RAP and 2,741% to crit. thats 30 RAP less than this set but 1,171% more crit.<br /><br />i personally prefer the higher RAP for raids since my crit is already pretty high and i hate FD spamming all the time not to take the aggro off of our MTs.<br />for PvP i'd prefer the MC combination but who is using dualwield in PvP when one is looking for high raptor crits!&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />anyway - this set is awesome for a hunter and as mentioned above, the main seems not to be a good choice for rouges. and i do not know any fury-warrior in my guild........<br />so i got the off-hand and looking hard now to get the main-hand!&nbsp; ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You guys are trying to compare things on the flat numbers of the items. You really have to understand how these items will be enchanted to get the full benefit.<br /><br />Fury Warrior - 15 str on each to maximize Bloodthirst. Or 15 str on off hand and +5 damage on main for more white.<br /><br />dual 15's = +58 AP main and +70 AP off with 1% crit<br />15 str/5 dam = +70 off and 52.7 DPS main with +28 AP, 1% crit<br /><br />Rogue - 15 agi on each or 15 agi off and +5 damage on main.<br /><br />dual 15's = +58 AP main and +70 AP off with 2.2% crit<br />15 agi/5 damage = +70 AP off and 52.7 DPS main with +28 AP, 1.75% crit<br /><br />Hunter - Only option is +15 agi on both<br /><br />dual 15's = +58 RAP main (+43 melee) and +70 RAP off (+55 melee), 1.55% crit<br /><br />due to class mechanics I listed them in the order of priority. Furry warriors would get the most sustained DPS out of the set. Rogues are second and hunters are third.<br /><br />Hunters score third due to the new +25 agi to 2 hand enchant. Look at the total number of AP from the set. It's +68 and 1% crit with 60 added from dual 15's agi enchant. Now look at Barbarous Blade which is +60 AP and 1% crit with 50 added from +25 agi enchant. So that makes a blue almost equal in value to a hunter as this purple set which would be huge upgrades to warriors and hunters. All a hunter gains by getting these 2 purples is 18 AP over an easy to get blue from Dire Maul. <br /><br />Learn to itemize.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Not sure if this has been mentioned, but +6 swords also increases your crit chance and chance to hit.<br />The formula is simple, 0.04% each skill point.<br /><br />So the set gives a total of 1.24% crit and 0.24% chance to hit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The off hand is great for a rogue. The main hand is great for a hunter. The set is great for a fury warrior.<br /><br />The off hand: as a rogue, I have to find 40 agi to get 40 AP. Hunters only need to find 20 AGI to get the same. Every single attack I make will be made with this sword, to a hunter its a stat item.<br /><br />The main hand: not enough on the top end for a rogue... but for a hunter 1% crit is good, throw in a bit of AP, and the fact that speed and top end don't matter, nice stuff.<br /><br />Fury warriors however get the best use from the set. +6 swords reduces your chance of 'Glancing Blows', increasing your dps by a significant margin against higher level mobs. Th AP and crit doesn't hurt either, or the insane speed on the main hand.<br /><br />And to those who think there are soooo many other viable choices out there...<br /><br />Pre BWL there are exactly FOUR epic sword drops for melee classes. THREE of these have a less than&nbsp; 5% drop rate.<br /><br />Onyxia has Vis'Kag (4% or so)<br />AQ 20 has nothing (go figure...)<br />MC has Brutality (13% or so)<br />ZG has this set (4-5% on each one)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This blade, and the offhand, both drop in ZG.&nbsp; This blade drops off Hakkar (the final boss) and the offhand drops off of Bloodlord Mandokir.&nbsp; I picked this blade up with my hunter a few weeks back, and i love it.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to getting Fang of the Faceless, as the mainhand hakkari/Fotf is one of the best combos available to hunters pre naxx.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as the rogue vs. hunter thing, this weapon could go either way if your guild cannot do MC.&nbsp; If your guild can do MC or BWL, i think this weapon is better for hunters, as the stats are just too good to pass up, and there are far better weapons for rogue damage in MC.&nbsp; The offhand kinda blows for hunters, and should prolly go to rogues or fury warriors in most cases.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, that's how my guild seems to be geared, all of the mainhand blades are on the hunters, and all of the offhands are on the rogues.<br /><br />oh, and btw..i'm not sure on the specific lvl for ZG, but i have seen 58's or so goin in there, but most guilds wont take you unless you are lvl 60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>honestly, these r pretty much the best weapons a hunter can possibly get before barb of the sand reaver, believe it or not. And no, not for pvp as some nub stated above, but for pve. With 2x 15 agi enchants they will give u ~1.5% crit and 112 AP. Tell me, which combo is better?<br />Some of u may say its better to get agi than ap as a hunter cus of LR. Well, speccing LR before u have ~450-500 unbuffed agi is stupid, as TSA + ranged weapon spec will give u a lot more dmg. And no, u wont have that much agi when ure doing ZG...<br /><br />All this from a raid perspective ofc, for pvp i'd definitely go for some big 2 hander for those raptor strikes :&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I'm currently working on a 28th level rogue. I see a lot of these discussions about what class has what claim to any weapon..<br /><br />In my opinion, I dont care who you think has first call to a weapon I can use. Half the reason I play this game is the aesthetics. Its a gorgeous game. I love the way my rogue looks. And I wont think twice about rolling for a sword I come across that I feel looks awesome. I really like the appearance of these weapons, and I would definitely roll on them if I ever get to that point. A lot of people play the game for the stats. I play it more for the look and feel. So, when we're questing at level 55, and I roll on a 'fury specced warrior sword', feel free to call me any names you want. I really wont care.</div>

You'll care when your SS spam damage literally drops by at least a third because you're swinging a 1.7 instead of a 2.7 of equivalent DPS.<br /><br />Seriously, any of the three melees should be eligible for it, priority only going to someone who would actually be completing a set by obtaining it. If it's a single item roll (i.e. no one has the main-hand) then it's fair game for all three, as it's a very nice boost for all of them.</div>

Brute Blade / Bloodletter outdo the MH anyday, so the hunters can have the MH, but the offhand is perfect for a rogue. The faster you can get in the offhand (being it doesn't dictate what your SS will be) the better. Plus, the extra attack will proc more often with a fast sword in the Offhand instead of a dagger if you are combat sword built (which im hoping you are if you are going after this sword). If your pvp with a dagger in the MH, there are better daggers out there you can get than this.<br /><br />Hunters, be a smart player, dont touch the offhand unless the rogues are better equipped (or if you are gready and don't care about the DPS in raids, because your won't be on the top with or without this sword)!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What some players dont seem to understand is that for a PvE rogue it's not about the yellow &quot;big crits&quot;, it's mostly all about the white dmg. The big crits draw aggro and will really not contribute as much to your dps as you might think. Speed is what's important in the long run for PvE, therefor go with imp SnD and speedy #$%^. As a troll rogue I would love this set, I'm not saying that the main han is totally awesome, but it's pretty good. With the +6 swords bonus you get like +2% hit and +1.5% crit too, so that's really what makes me excited. Specc right, do corrrect combos and you'll pwn all end game instances, but if you wanna go for high crits on SS's then this aint the set for you. Vis'kag, BB, CTS... any of these will do great for SS dmg and a high amount of DPS, point is you'll get more proccs and (oh wow really?) more hits / minute with fast swords which equals to more proccs, more crits, more DMG. <br /><br />P.S. All hunters who says these swords are awesome for them... give me a break, these wont contribute nearly as much for you as they would for a rogue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You ve got to love those &quot;my class has endless, endless more need than yours&quot; discussions.<br />In case anyone is interested I'm playing rogue as well and here are my cc on this set - post patch 1.8:<br /><br />Only using Sinister Strike, this Set will stick slightly below a Dal Rend Set during a combat that lasts 10 seconds (about 50 damage less), it will produce almost equal damage in a fight that lasts 20 seconds (about 15 damage less) and it will finally get the better of Dal Rend in a fight that takes 30 seconds (about 2 damage more).<br />That being only the case if you only spam SS. If you refrein to other comboes, the Hakkari Set will come out on top prior to the 20 seconds.<br /><br />So yes, in long fights this set is an alternative for rogue's who fight with swords and do not get a grip on a weapon better than Dal Rends Sacred Charge in the main hand.<br /><br />As a matter of fact this sword could be very nice for poison specced rogues, as it would even increase the damage output by poison over time, thus already winning the advantage over Dal Rend prior to the ten second.<br />Yes a poison specced rogue with 3 parts bloodfang and a BWL trinket might consider this a viable option.<br /><br />But other than that it really is not half as good for rogues as for warriors - EVEN after patch 1.8.<br /><br />Of course, if the +6 swords bonus can compensate for approximatly 1000 damage every half minute, than this set has a place even over Vis'kag, else get yourself some other loot target.<br /><br />---<br /><br />The main hand clearly belongs to fury warriors before any other class, as long as the warriors are not primarily specced on mortal strike.<br /><br />Hunter clearly can take an advantage from this sets boni and the larger ATK gain over Dal Rend. They profit largely from this as well.<br /><br />Rogues ... well, aside from the one exception mentioned above ... no.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Sep 30 02:29:08 2005</div>

They will be replaced INSTANTLY in MC or BWL. The stats a beyond perfect for hunters. THey get 128 AP (with 15 agil on both) and 1.5% crit. For most hunters in raid gear that have met soft crit cap it is BETTER to have the 40 AP OH than core hound tooth or another 1% crit one hander because the AP starts to matter more once your crit is at 19% (and spoecced for lethal shots).<br /><br />These are Hunter BiS till AQ maybe even Naxx<br /><br />HunTAR LOOT</div>
