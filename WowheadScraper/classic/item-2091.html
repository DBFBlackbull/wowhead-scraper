For Alliance, Westfall is a stage you just want to get past, and the Dust Devils are a hazard in that area. They are level 17-18 elementals that just mess with level 12-15 players. If you see one, you steer clear. Once you are past Westfall, you never go back.\n\n2. Horde have no reason to be in the area. Low level mobs, close to Stormwind, plus lower level Alliance players will make sure everyone knows they are there.\n\nThe dust itself, is very valuable in my opinion. For PVP, it lasts about 10 seconds, depending on what level of player you throw it on. I only hit 60's with it, and from what I could tell, 10 seconds is the max. Taurens appear to be resistant to it, but not sure at what level it becomes total.\n\nAgainst mobs is where this stuff really shines. Normal or elite, it uses the full 30 seconds, and that is a long time if you are in a one on one fight. Some of the higher level mobs tested were 52 elite dragonkin in the burning steps, and High Chief Winterfall in Winterspring, 59 elite. Puts them to sleep, then you have a choice of what to do. Heal, run, loot other corpses, just don't hit em.\n\nEasy easy to farm at higher levels. There are 11 dust devils in the area, just enough for one farmer. Sometimes lowbies will put them on the AH for a few silver. I recommend a buy on that.","date":"2006-06-28T13:33:15-05:00","rating":30,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Thank you for this reply.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Boudan</b></h3>Magic dust is essential for successfully completing part of the hunter's epic bow quest. The magic dust is used to sleep the pet of the Un'Goro demon while the hunter fights the demon itself. If you get this drop, sell it in the AH!<br /><br />Also, Anvil is correct... the drop rate is terrible and the spawns are limited. They do respawn somewhat frequently though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>171</b></h3>Great item for classes who dont't have any CC. If you are stubborn enough you can make alot of money selling this dust and win many fights using it. The only problem - very rare spawns, so 100% mount is very usefull if you are going to farm this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Before patch 1.6 these dropped fairly often but there were less dust devils. Now they added a lot more dust devils and it hasn't dropped a single time out of 10+ kills</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is the most useful low level item in game, this stuff put to sleep level 60 elite mobs, and that I can say becuase I havnt tested it on higher ones<br /><br />I use it when raiding ubrs and dust one of general drakish bodyguards in the end, its like a frigging sap usuable by everyone and in combat</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Today was the first time I've gotten one since I was level 30. (I'm 60 now)<br /><br />I was in Westfall running loops getting every chest for the infernal swiftness potion recipe that I STILL don't have. On a lark I was killing the dust devils as well even though I was pretty conviced that magic dust was removed from the game. I was so shocked when my first magic dust dropped.<br /><br />I spent almost 3 hours looping the zone and I killed nearly 30 devils to get those 4 magic dust drops.<br /><br />JackieChad</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can Alliance still buy these from vendors?&nbsp; Aside from that being un-cool since Bliz made Slumber Sand soulbound for horde a couple patches ago; you alliance could make massive money selling this stuff to Horde on the Neutral AH (On PvP servers).<br /><br />Slumber Sand use to sell 5 stack for 5g+.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yeah it works every time if this haven't changed since i used this 2 patches ago... its somehow easy to get( u can farm this since lvl 20 or something) and its ultimate item of gg :) i&nbsp; love it but drop rate is about 1/20 mobs so u have to spend much time to make a stack of it... <br />gl farming!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just got one as of 3/9/06</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Certainly these still exist, but the droprate seems to be substantially reduced. I've had 2 or 3 in about 60 kills or so, which is an extraordinary run of bad luck if the droprate is really 1 in 6, as current Thottbot data would suggest.<br /><br />Think I'll give up on using them in AB.<br /><br /> And of course immediately after posting this I get 3 in about 15 kills. I don't know what to think any more. Curse random chance...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just bought 2 of them for 15s buyout each when I was looking for dust for enchanting.<br />With my very first character I got one too, but it was sheeping instead of sleep. I guess they changed that when they changed the droprates, too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If there was any doubt that it still exists I just got one today. I'm suprised I even took out a level 18 elemental with a level 14 Mage, but I did and got this, first and so far only kill with this character. It involved some fancy tricks I learned leveling up my other mage, like the jump-spin-fireblast. I was near dead when I got him, I ran back to loot and then a bird attacked, I FN'd and got away from him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Once you get your leaf from Domo have at least two of these ready for your epic quest...this makes the un'goro demon ridiculously easy! Freeze dog, melee, dust dog, melee, over.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got these while farming copper in westfall (ok I was very bored). Remembering my hatred for those Dust Devils when I was lower level, I attacked it and one of these dropped. I am both happy and sad; Happy because they seem very useful for PVP (I especially like the idea about using them in the arena!) but I am sad because now that I've discovered them I predict several hours of my life will be spent farming them.</div>

For Alliance, Westfall is a stage you just want to get past, and the Dust Devils are a hazard in that area. They are level 17-18 elementals that just mess with level 12-15 players. If you see one, you steer clear. Once you are past Westfall, you never go back.<br /><br />2. Horde have no reason to be in the area. Low level mobs, close to Stormwind, plus lower level Alliance players will make sure everyone knows they are there.<br /><br />The dust itself, is very valuable in my opinion. For PVP, it lasts about 10 seconds, depending on what level of player you throw it on. I only hit 60's with it, and from what I could tell, 10 seconds is the max. Taurens appear to be resistant to it, but not sure at what level it becomes total.<br /><br />Against mobs is where this stuff really shines. Normal or elite, it uses the full 30 seconds, and that is a long time if you are in a one on one fight. Some of the higher level mobs tested were 52 elite dragonkin in the burning steps, and High Chief Winterfall in Winterspring, 59 elite. Puts them to sleep, then you have a choice of what to do. Heal, run, loot other corpses, just don't hit em.<br /><br />Easy easy to farm at higher levels. There are 11 dust devils in the area, just enough for one farmer. Sometimes lowbies will put them on the AH for a few silver. I recommend a buy on that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is not Vendor item although it is listed as such<br />When u look at magic dust u get 2 items one lower lvl than the other and has picture of cheese(darnasian)<br />Well i has so happy to go get me some unlimited supplies from vendor but found out that it was plain cheese someone plz fix this !<br />As for dust drop rate it really is low killed more than 15 and only got 1 dust and that is after riding around for a long time cause the buggers are not many on map.Drop rate not nearly more than 3-5%max<br />Hope this helped :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed for about 1.15 hrs. I didn't get any for the first 45 minutes. Most of them didn't have any loot. Got about 2 greens and a shadowgem and then finally 1 magic dust. I got 3 magic dust in the last 15 minutes i farmed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I stand corrected and agree with Above post <br />I Tried again few times and not only are dust devils pretty low in number but after 45 min 27-30 dust devils and 4 greens etc No Dust at all :((<br />This is so screwed up ..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No question that this IS still in the game.&nbsp; I just spent this morning farming WESTFALL for the dust.&nbsp; You can expect around 2-3 dusts on AVERAGE to drop per hour of farming (with epic mount)depending on your efficiency.&nbsp; I spent this morning farming and I now have 10.&nbsp; Know the spawn locations of the dust devils and make your rounds.&nbsp; It's a very boring grind but can be done.&nbsp; It's quite an epic green drop if you ask me.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if you see the map that shows the different spawn points (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/m=1904">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/m=1904</a>) you will see that there is a kind of circle of elementals around the Alexston Farmstead (Southeast of the Goldcoast Quarry). With my non-epic mount and my 41 Hunter, I can go around this circle and pretty much catch the elementals just as they spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of August 19th, they exist, I got one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think I farmed for about 30 minutes or so and got 2. So yeah you can still get it, but unless you have a need for it... I wouldn't invest the time...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have 3 stacks of this stuff, no one understands why the druid can put anything to sleep :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>30 second sleep effect, I can't see why you wouldn't farm em.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This stuff rocks if you like ninja capping in AB like me.&nbsp; I can solo ninja a node guarded by up to 3 Horde.&nbsp; I do this by:<br /><br />1) sap 1st target<br />2) magic dust 2nd target<br />3) Goblin Rocket helmet 3rd target<br /><br />If the magic dust + sap holds, I have an easy cap.&nbsp; Usually it does.&nbsp; So, I'll farm for this stuff and only use it if i absolutely have to.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>nvm read a post above&nbsp; found my answer :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been using these alot recently on my Twink BE Hunter, made a path that I run to farm em and just thought I'd share it.&nbsp; Black line is the path you follow and the green dot's are where the elementals are spawned.&nbsp; You can get 10-12 elemental kills per path around, each path takes about 6-7 minutes on an epic mount.<br /><a href="http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/3571/magicdustxe7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/3571/magicdustxe7.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I personally won't be using these to dust mobs, though I'm sure they're useful for special situations, like quests. I am saving these exclusively for gankers! Finally something that gives a grey a fair chance to get away from those fracking level ? gankers! ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>with no cooldowns or limits this is very usefull for hte hunter epic quest in un'goro, in theory you can remove pet from battle with this stuff untill you kill the chick.... very nice seeing how its harder to kite with 2 targets ^.^<br /><br />too bad for the low drop rate<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 3rd 2006 at 3:43am PST by happyhobbit</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>- Stacks in 10.<br />- Cooldown is 3 minutes.<br />- Can be used on range of 30 yards. You have to stand still to use it.<br />- Will not last for 30secs (tends to break earlier), but even a few seconds can help a lot, especially in the Battlegrounds.<br />- Not sure if it can be dispelled, think it can though since it is called 'magic' =]</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>seems nice but? range? duration?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dose this stuff drop in 1.11? I'm trying to get soem for my hunter quest, and after 2 hours and 0 dust I gave up. But, since I'm under geared for the quest (my hunter is an alt, but no mains needed it, so I got summoned in to loot the chest) so I'm thinking I'll need the dust to get this demon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm guessing it's one time use. Hope they stack :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>pass one(13, all of them once and one twice):<br />magic dust x4, Northern Shortsword of Stamina, Elemental Air.<br /><br />pass 2(12, all of them once):<br />magic dust, Moss Agate, Buccaneer's Gloves of the Owl<br /><br />pass 3(12, all of them once):<br />Willow Branch of Fiery Wrath, Dust Bowl<br /><br />pass 4(10, all but 2 cause someone else killed them):<br />nothing.... T_T<br /><br />pass 5(12, all of them once):<br />magic dust, Seer's Gloves<br /><br />--------------------<br />so, 59 and all i'm left with of any use only 6 magic dusts, a moss agate, an essence of air, and one off hand a twink <i>may</i> want... still better than buying these at the median price. 99s for something that drops of lvl 18-19 stuff? ouch</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It is still dropping. Just collected two of them for my hunter epic quest yesterday but be prepared to an horrible drop rate ... I killed like 30 + of these things for 2 dusts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>sells for 5g a piece on Grim Batol alliance :O</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Handy in ungoro, for the hunter quest boss, for sleeping the doggy. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Looted RIGHT today. It is very real, still. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went two rounds to kill the Dust Devils today, thus killing 24 of them. Two Magic Dust dropped, which is definitely rarer than the drop rate listed here. I might just have been unlucky though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Drop rate for me was about 2%<br />made me mad because i saw the 17% on here.<br /><br />Adeiene - Cenarion Circle</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, I just killed 13 of these things.....at level 41....not only did I not get any magic dust, I didn't get a single drop of ANYTHING.....is it because I am too high of level?<br /><br />I killed a lower level bird in the same area and got bird meat......makes no sense.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xelaa</b></h3>For those of you playing Classic, be aware that the drop rate is actually ~5%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>j0llyr0ger</b></h3>Don't bother using this on undead players.. WotF breaks them right out of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>etou11</b></h3>Killed 125 Dust Devils and got a meager 3 Dusts (~2,4 % drop chance)</div>
