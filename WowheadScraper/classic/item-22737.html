<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The bird on top is a raven, not an owl. The appearance almost exactly matches how it looks in the Warcraft III cinematics, most prominently visible when Medivh appears as a raven and warns king Terenas of the plague.<br /><br />This is probably one of the only items that has been modeled before they even started working on WoW, explaining the not-so-legendary looks.<br />But it would've been very odd if they changed it into something more appealing, while it has been so well visible before.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Interesting point you made (beside the swearing, that is), I found it quite remarkable to find such great difference in stats.<br />It may be due to the fact that the mage version has yet to be found, and may still change.<br /><br />But when calculating the item points used it can make sense. For easy experimention I used <a href="http://subcreation.net/itemlevel/" rel="nofollow">http://subcreation.net/itemlevel/</a> to calculate items levels (uses the Hyz system), the item scores below refer to the raw item scores used in this calculation.<br /><br />Let's compare:<br /><br />The stats that are the same, and therefore can be left out of the calculations:<br />- 150 damage/healing<br />- Karazhan portal<br /><br />The mage version:<br />- 31 sta - Item score: 7130<br />- 32 int - Item score: 7360<br />- 24 spi - Item score: 5520<br />- 2% hit - Item score: 5000<br />- 2% crit to all party members - 2% crit has an item score of 5200. I assumed it is multiplied by 5 (the number of party members), so 26000.<br /><br />All added together: 51010<br /><br />The warlock version:<br />- 30 sta - Item score: 6900<br />- 29 int - Item score: 6670<br />- 2% crit - Item score: 5200<br />- 33 damage/healing to all party members - As above, but now for 33 damage/healing with an item score of 6336, resulting in 31680.<br /><br />All added together: 50450<br /><br />So the difference would be 560 points, which seems to be equivalent to only a few stat points, or they can be attributed to the inaccuracy of the calculator.<br /><br />Of course, this may be wrong:<br />- the calculator can just suck<br />- my assumption for the value of the party member effects is wrong<br />- I may have misinterpreted the way the calculator should be used<br />- etc. etc.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the stats for these items <b>may</b> be defendable using WoW's item values.<br /><br />But I sure agree that is seems imbalanced.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To make everyone know...<br />medivh is the son of the woman who killed sargeras, she got corrupted and when medivh born, the cursed transfered to him, and from him to the stave.So he opened the dark portal to let the orcs come to azeroth and make it less powerfuller to the coming of the legion, then when orc became good, undeads came and started to corrupt the world</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Gotta love how the CASTER legendary gets outdated so guickly :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why actually keep the staff when you could sell it? I mean it's over 17g vendor! Think of all the darkmoon reserve! ;)Not to mention, of course, you would become world famous among all warcraft players as the dumbass who actually turned it into vendor trash...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There seems to be a conflict. Some people want this staff to look menacing and evil with at least two different glows, maybe some spikes and acid dripping from a shark's mouth or something. Another group finds the simplicity of design and lore behind the current model admirable.<br /><br />The only resolution to this conflict is to increase the size of the current staff by 10000%, allowing it to sweep grandly though the entire city of Ironforge every time its wielder turns around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The staff will port you OUTSIDE Karazhan, and eaven if you wanted get this staff, Karazhan attunement would be easyer. <br /><br />Pre-BC, this staff was like... well lets say like doing a lvl 65 or maybe 66 instance at lvl 60, and it was very hard. i myself never got a splinter - The mages (priests got Hammer of Twisting Nether) had priority - and since im warlock i could just cry tears of flame in anger&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Now, after BC, this staff is easy to get if you have a guild willing help you whit it. I heard of guilds grinding it to their casters for the Portal to Karazhan (evryone HS shattrath and take the port, easy and fast for repair etc)<br /><br />To clear out the quest // drop to get it:<br /><br />Pieces <br />The staff has been split into several pieces which were scattered around the world. <br /><br />Kel'Thuzad's underlings in Naxxramas each have a chance to drop a . <br />Once all 40 Splinters have been found, they may be combined into the , which gives a quest to visit the dragon Anachronos. You are then given a quest to obtain the Staff Head and Base of Atiesh. <br />Kel'Thuzad drops . <br />The drops from C'Thun in the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj. <br />You have to travel to Stratholme to cleanse the staff, and then slay Atiesh, Hand of Sargeras. <br />(Than ks to WoWWiki)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Atiesh%2C_Greatstaff_of_the_Guardian" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Atiesh%2C_Greatstaff_of_the_Guardian</a></div>
