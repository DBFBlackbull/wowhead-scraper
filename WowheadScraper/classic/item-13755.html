However, if you are not going that far, the quickest way to get to the good fishing area, at least for Horde, seems to be to ride through the Ruins of El'Darath.  There are several ways out onto the beach from there, the best possibly being on the northerly side of the ruins at about 40,48 or so.  You can use this same path to get back as well if you do not want to burn your hearth when you are returning.  If you are 60, you should be able to come and go with little to no aggro from the naga.  \r\n\r\n[i]Here's the thing though[\/i].  The map would have you believe that the entire beach is Bay of Storms but, at least for fishing, this is not actually the case.  You need to get off the coast a little bit to one of the islands.  The jetty at 52,49 or even the island near there that is very close to shore do not count.  You can tell you are in the wrong spot if it lets you cast at 300 (or even 300+25) without telling you your fishing level is too low.  If you fish from there, you are not getting the bonus droprate for winter squid (basically like fishing from Tanaris or the Hinterlands).  If you have to apply a lure and are catching lots of lobsters and the blue mightfish (large raw) instead of the green (raw glossy), you are in the right place.  \r\n\r\nThere is a small island out from the end of the jetty (52,49 or so) that is a short swim that I have been using and it seems to work well.","date":"2019-10-08T09:57:38-05:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":46,"id":3162819,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"NashEquil","body":"My experience on the Mankrik Classic Server on 10\/9\/2019\n\nI used 2 x [item=6533] and 10 x [item=6532]\nMy pole was a [item=6367] +20 fishing (You get from Shellfish Traps in Desolace - 1% or so drop rate)\n\nMy fishing skill is 300, so I had 420 skill with [item=6533] and 395 with [item=6532]\nI had a rate of around 12% \"Your fish got away\" messages (didn't have any with the [item=6533] equipped)\n\nI am alliance, and did this entire fishing session in Azshara during morning hours (around 7-9:30 am server time)\n[b]I fished entirely in Bay of Storms...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's probably seasonal reading the tough luck on these posts, and maybe time-of-day sensitive. I started fishing in Tanaris only recently upon reaching lvl 40 and completing the artisan fishing quest (it's late October) and think I caught 4 or 5 while fishing for 10 Zesty clam meat (cooking quest), maybe a half hour give or take. Didn't note time of day, just took it for granted. Also caught maybe 6 stonescale eels which go for about a gold EACH. Needless to say, came back quite a few times, caught more stonescales, but no squid until tonight about 11pm EST (i think 8 server time), caught 8 squid over the next 30 minutes, but they stopped biting soon there after, and while I'm still catching many stonescales, no squid. But I'm only now paying attention and don't have it down to a science. Hope this helps...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There seems to be some debate on this fish on when it can be caught.

Here's a few answers for those of you who can't seem to find the willpower to research.<br /><br />1: Winter squid are only available in the <i>winter</i>.<br />2: It is strongly suggested that you have a fishing skill of at least 205 before attempting to catch winter squid.<br /><br />And to answer those endless questions about when it is considered winter in-game, think of this:<br /><br /><a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/info/events/calendar/" rel="nofollow">World of Warcraft In-Game Events Calendar</a><br /><br />The Feast of Winter Veil? That's in the winter. It is also in December. Question answered.<br /><br />In the future, before spamming comments, <i>please</i> make some attempt to do a little research.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jfoobar</b></h3>These are now catchable in classic at least as of this morning.

During this 10 minutes, I did not catch a single summer bass, so I don't know if that means that there will be no overlap when both can be caught or not. Too small of a sample size.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jfoobar</b></h3>Re: Bay of Strorms fishing:<br /><br />If you are going to see Duke Hydro for something, by all means just fish from his island. However, if you are not going that far, the quickest way to get to the good fishing area, at least for Horde, seems to be to ride through the Ruins of El'Darath. There are several ways out onto the beach from there, the best possibly being on the northerly side of the ruins at about 40,48 or so. You can use this same path to get back as well if you do not want to burn your hearth when you are returning. If you are 60, you should be able to come and go with little to no aggro from the naga. <br /><br /><i>Here's the thing though</i>. The map would have you believe that the entire beach is Bay of Storms but, at least for fishing, this is not actually the case. You need to get off the coast a little bit to one of the islands. The jetty at 52,49 or even the island near there that is very close to shore do not count. You can tell you are in the wrong spot if it lets you cast at 300 (or even 300+25) without telling you your fishing level is too low. If you fish from there, you are not getting the bonus droprate for winter squid (basically like fishing from Tanaris or the Hinterlands). If you have to apply a lure and are catching lots of lobsters and the blue mightfish (large raw) instead of the green (raw glossy), you are in the right place. <br /><br />There is a small island out from the end of the jetty (52,49 or so) that is a short swim that I have been using and it seems to work well.</div>
