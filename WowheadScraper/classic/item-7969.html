<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Both bIlliAn and Uliza are wrong about Mithril spurs speed increase.<br /><br />Here is how I figured it out with lvl40 mount:<br /><br /><b>Carrot on a stick:</b><br /><br />Carrot on a stick increases 3% mount speed as it states in the trinket.<br /><br />However Monkeyspeed shows that the total speed with only Coas equipped is 165%.<br /><br />So simple multiplication 160 x 1.03 = 164.8 = ~165.<br /><br /><b>Mithril spurs:</b><br /><br />Monkeyspeed shows that the total speed with only spurs attached is 166-167.<br /><br />Assume that the speed increase is 4%.<br /><br />Now 160 x 1.04 = 166.4 = ~166.<br /><br />So the speed increase would be 4%.<br /><br /><b>Finally with both Carrot and the spurs:</b><br /><br />Monkeyspeed shows that the totalspeed with both is 171-172.<br /><br />So 164.8 x 1,04 = 171.4 = ~171.<br /><br /><b>Conclusion:</b><br /><br />Carrot on a stick +3%, Monkeyspeed shows 165%.<br />Mithril spurs +4%, Monkeyspeed shows 166%.<br />Both ~+7%, Monkeyspeed shows 171%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Man, you guys really put some work into this. Im not sure of the %'s. I don't really want to put that much work into figuring out something I know I will use anyway. I do know if you use the spurs, enchant, and carrot you have made the mount you are using (lvl 40 or 60) go as fast as it can. Any other player with the same mount as you that does not using all of these will not go as fast as you. It improves the speed on all mounts at this time.<br /><br />The Spurs are made and installed by a blacksmith and only a blacksmith.<br /><br />Riding gloves are enchanted, you got it, only by an enchanter.<br /><br />The carrot is a quest reward and you can not do it alone at lvl 40. A group should be easy to find.<br /><br />All of these can be used by a lvl 40. The spurs and enchant can be installed as low as first lvl boots and gloves. Why you would want to is beyond me. If you go into combat while mounted and get knocked off your mount, you can not switch armor while in combat and you will be fighting with lvl 1 gear.<br /><br />Good luck guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>do they speed up the bird 'mount' between flightpaths?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a high level blacksmith on doomhammer and I attach these for people from time to time (as well as make them). When you attempt to attach spurs to boots with any modification, I get a popup saying:<br />Would you like to replace &quot;Modification Name&quot; with &quot;Mithril Spurs&quot;?<br /><br />Spurs will replace enchantments, armor modifications (by armor kits), or existing spurs. Hopefully Blizzard will change that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These are EXCELLENT for increasing blacksmithing from 215 all the way to 260. At a cost of only 4 mithril bars and 12 solid stone per spur, it's incredibly cheap to make these, and if you're patient you will be able to sell every single one and turn a profit.<br /><br />I bought these plans off the AH for 1G (incredibly lucky, I know) and then spent a total of about 15g on mats to go from 230 to 260 smithing. I sold about 30g worth of spurs at 1.75g each. A good strategy to sell them is walk around inspecting level 60s and see if they have anything on their boots. If they have low reinforced armor or nothing on them, whisper them to buy your spurs then open the trade window. More often then not they are willing to drop a measly 1.75g to put the spurs on.<br /><br />Good luck, I HIGHLY recommend spending up to 15g on this recipe at level 215 smithing!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Mount speed percentages increase based on the speed of your mount.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>musclemonkeh</b></h3>I feel like something isn't exactly clear about the effect of the mithril spurs on enchantments and buffs in a pair of boots.<br /><br />The mithril spurs take up the added enchantment space, so yes, if you have ADDED an enchantment on a pair of boots it will replace that. However, if the buff or enchantment is inherent to the construction of the boots it doesn't affect it. This includes things like buffs on agility, strength, etc. as well as some footwear that inherently increases land speed.<br /><br />Basically, the <i>mithril spurs act as an ADDED enchantment</i> for which there is typically one slot on footwear but <b>don't affect qualities inherent to the footwear itself</b>. Just tested this on a couple different pairs.<br /><br />At least it worked that way when I tested it on Swift Boots and Excelsiors.<br /><br />Does that make sense?</div>
