<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know the highest pick-lock you can get off of these?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You will get &quot;invalid target&quot; if you try to lockpick a lock that you've allready used once.<br /><br />You cannot relock these, so it's a one time use only.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>as a Rogue you need to lvl up your lockpicking skills to pass the posion quest at lvl 21 pick once sell pick again till you get to lvl 75 lockpick now box is gray no more skills for you to learn. As an enginer you make and sell to Rogues they need them. I sell for 6s</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't consider it a waste if it ups my Engineering skill. Once it goes gray...yeah, then it'll be a waste to make any.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Waste of everything for a rogue who's lockpicking. If you're alliance, just go to the mill in Redridge and pick the practice chests. I'm up to 100 lockpicking and they're still green.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I made a couple of these to level up my engineering and sent one to my rogue thinking that it would be able to use it over and over to train my skill. No such luck. I also tried to sell it to a vendor and buy it back to see if it was re-locked. Again, no such luck. If you want to work on your lockpicking skill, I recommend going to the rogue training area in Ogrimmar or Undercity. There should be someone there who can recommend an area that has locked chests. This way you can up your skill AND do some gathering, rather than burning up three bars of copper and spending a silver on some weak flux.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These can be made by engineers (made one on mine) and sold or given to rogues of low level to raise their lockpicking ability.&nbsp; My lvl16 rogue gained lockpicking, my engineer mailed it to him, he used it and threw it away, as they can only be used ONCE.&nbsp; It says it is locked when you mouse over it if it is useable, otherwise it just says Practice Lock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wish they would let engeneers lock them again make things simple and make sence. After all the make them locked the first time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How are the plans for rocket fuel useless? I make these and sell them on AH for 1G50S - 2G. The alchemists buy them so they can learn to make rocket fuel, which they then sell back to us... Makes sense for everybody.<br />Try making a couple and AH them, see your bank balance soar :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was able to go from lockpicking 1 - 100 skill level on these things, granted it took a little while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yep, I stopped about 102 on them, was taking like 10 to 15 before I would get one point.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The is a <b>one-time use only</b> item.<br />It <b>is</b> for Rogues, that's right.<br />Once you've picked it, you can discard(delete) it or sell to a vendor. You cannot re-lock it.<br /><br />As mentioned above, do not waste a whole lot of money/materials on these, just fly to Redridge Mountain, to the Alther's Mill (Just above Lakeshire) and pick youself to death there. Simply place yourself between 3 chests and pick away. The chests spawn quickly, and it won't take you long to level on them. After hitting 80-90 it's really slow progress. <br /><u><b>Also worth mentioning</b></u>, is that there's alot of pickable chests on the bottom of the Lakeshire Lake.<br /><br />That's it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As an engineer and a rogue, I made one of these locked boxes thinking I could practice unlocking it - especially since I have my certificate. The box is yellow, but I cannot figure out how to unlock it. Can someone please help?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The chests next to the parrot for the Polly quest and the chest in the tower for the Poison quest are both repeatedly pickable til about 160, this item is a complete waste of space.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Answers to all the questions above...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; /tloc 51,45 - lvl lockpicking from lvl 21 (where i started) to lvl 100<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Go to Redridge (aka, lakeshire). Follow the path North from the bridge. You will see the first right after you go up the big hill. Keep going down the dirt road (you will pass some fire whelps. When you go down the hill, you will see Alther's Mill. It looks like a mill with a big saw blade. <br /><br />1.&nbsp; In the back of the mill are 5 chest. You can pick them all day long. They respawn really fast.<br /><br />P.S. I got to lvl 100 on lock picking, the chest were still green, but was not able to get past 100. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT LVL CAP ON YOUR LOCK PICKING. Remember that it will cap off at your lvl. I am lvl 21 on this rouge and my cap is 105. I can't pick any locks past 100.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im a warrior and i can make these but is it worth it so i can sell them. i mean could i make a profit? and if so how much could i sell them for? if you want some wisper Ferny on Steemweedle cartle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No<br /><br />This cant be disenchanted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item is not so bad at all if you are a Rogue AND an engineer. I am, and by creating those, picking them and selling them to vendor or just discarding them you both level ur lockpicking skill and engineer skill (Surprise, ey?). I think you can level on practice locks up to 100~ until' it becomes grey. Also, Althers Mill isnt a town, its a mill in northern redridge. And if you arent a engineer, leveling at Althers M. and in the lake in redridge is quite good.<br /><br /><b>Cheers</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got my lockpicking skill with my rogue when i was lvl 16. my friend told me to get a practice lock to lvl up my lockpicking. i bought one for 50s and bought thieves' tools. i tried to open it and it said invalid target. i also read that if u get ur lockpicking skill in a major city that u get a lockpicking quest. i got mine in Brill and was wondering if i can still get the quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I saved one of my practice locks and have yet to see it reset itself, either over time or by zoning with a loading screen, etc.&nbsp; If it ever did have that ability, it seems to no longer be the case.&nbsp; For those looking to purchase through AH, beware how much you invest to test the conflicting theories for yourself.&nbsp; Young rogues can get themselves over to the pirate ship in Ratchet with only a bit of sweat and tears (I died a few times trying to get past the murlocs while running up the coast from Theramore), yet the trip was well worth it as the practice lockers do respawn almost as soon as you pick them.&nbsp; I maxed out the skill cap for my level within half an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I wonder. I once had a friend rogue unlock a mithril lockbox. The box had more than 1 item in it, so, I decided, to save space (bag slots) by not taking the items out and just mail it &quot;unlocked&quot; to my alt char (who is my &quot;banker&quot;)&nbsp; for him to AH the items. When the mithril lockbox showed up in my alt's mail, it was locked again. Maybe this is true for this practice locks as well :) I'll try it (as soon as my rogue engineer can make these) if it works and kkep you posted. If it is the case, create some lockboxes, (or buy them), send them to your rogue, have your rogue unlock and send them to an alt char, and that alt char can return the lockbox re-locked for you to keep practicing :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if you wanna skill ur lockpicking dont skill on theese. Go to Alther's Mill in Redridge Mountains and there u will find some boxes that u can lock pick. I skilled from 5 to 80 in less than 15 min...</div>
