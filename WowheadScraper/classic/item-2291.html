This weapon is great for a hunter!  Let's consider why:\n\nWrongheaded argument 1:  hunters should only care about stats (particularly agility).  Ha ha!  If you are fighting mobs, a little agility makes no difference because mobs are stupid and you just stand back and kill them.  If you are fighting PvP and players are so stupid that let you stand back and shoot them, they will also die.  But most players understand that they should close in and engage you, either casting in your dead zone or doing hand-to-hand combat.  All that agility is worth ZERO at that point, which is where you will find yourself constantly in PvP.\n\nWrongheaded argument 2:  hunters can't\/don't\/shouldn't melee.  See above--everyone will want to melee you (except other hunters).  Since you can't avoid melee, what should you do?  If you have the savage strikes talent, your crit chance is raised by 20% for the raptor strike you can do every 6 seconds.  Make it count--get a big, slow weapon that will crit for a lot of damage.  When they close in on you, take that raptor strike swing for 25-30% crit chance and make it count!  Then hit them with a wing clip (which is instant cast) and run.  Using a slow weapon is fine because you will be running around between strikes, and all you care about is big damage when you do take a swing.\n\nWrongheaded argument 3:  Hunters shouldn't get warrior\/rogue weapons.  Since rogues favor fast weapons, I would agree.  I also wouldn't bother with any dual wield combinations (despite the populatity of such things in the hunter world, ostensibly to get the max +30 agility enchanting--see argument 1).  But hunters need the biggest, meanest 2-hand weapon they can wield.  That does put them in conflict with many a mighty warrior.  Okay, if the weapon is better than what a warrior already has, let him have it.  But if the melee guys already have something better, the hunter deserves to get a shot at a good high damage 2-hander.  In a PUG, people are going to be jerks about it.  But a guild is just shooting themselves in the foot to deny a high crit weapon to their hunters, especially if they do PvP.\n\nKang the Decapitator is a great weapon for a hunter.  The only alternative I would consider in the 40-49 range is the stoneraven [item=13059]  That has almost as high damage and great stats and is easier and cheaper to acquire.  But like I said, if you don't melee (PvE carebears), stats aren't that a big a deal anyway.  If you do PvP, getting the bleed proc on your opponent really hurts and I would trade it for the stats any day.  Why?  Raising your average DPS a couple of points won't kill anyone very often, but getting Kang's proc will kill people quite often.  Almost winning but losing 99% of the time isn't as good as almost losing but proc'ing for the win 10% of the time.  You just raised your victory percentage by an order of magnitude in melee combat!\n\n(If you are tempted to say that the proc is 5%, remember that procs scale by weapon speed.  10% is probably a reasonable estimate, and it could be higher given how slow the weapon is.  That is another nice thing about hunters using a slow weapon with a good proc--they get more bang for their buck on the few swings they take in melee combat!)","date":"2006-07-26T15:55:17-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Wow you are retarded, agility for a hunter is not about the dodge its about the crit and ranged attack power (2 r.a.p. per agility).

I crit 600-1000 with MS. I reccomend it for any warriors/shaman/paladin wanting to PvP, otherwise it will be replaced with Ice Barbed SPear at level 51. For PvPing however, it knows no equal! The proc doesnt happen all that often, probably a 5% proc rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8564</b></h3>It's a worlddrop and its awesome for level twinked 49-ms-specced warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8403</b></h3>This weapon not only looks great, but the proc on it totally pwns people, too. This weapon will almost definitely last you until level 60, unless you somehow find something better, but I know quite a few 60s who still use this weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9296</b></h3>Although a great drop, unless I could buy this very cheap or got lucky enough to find it, I wouldn't go out of my way to find it because it can be easily replaced at 60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>13169</b></h3>Hunters, Shamans, and Warriors will love this axe. Throw +25Agil, or Crusader enchant and you'll be styling =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hellreject</b></h3>Actually, for an arms warrior you will find better weapons before you hit 60.<br />Yes, Kang will stick it through for a few levels, but The NIcker ( <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13285">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13285</a> ) will be better for an MS spec. The slow speed, the high top-damage and the proc makes it a very viable weapon. And you get it already at lvl 53.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shivacode</b></h3>Ah, the Kang. This is pretty much the end-all be-all weapon of the 40-49 bracket for MS warriors, 2H Stormstrike shamans and Ret paladins. Great damage, incredible top-end, a rogue-killer proc and you basically have an item that will be used by twinks until the end of this game. <br /><br />Pick one up if you plan on doing serious PVP in the 40-49 BG bracket, and toss a Crusader on it if you're hardcore. =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone that has it has two epics :o</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A lot of people are wondering why this Axe sells for a lot when its not &quot;impressive&quot;. The thing is for a warrior or paladin this is a dream weapon. When you talk about a paladin and warrior, they have to ignore DPS of a weapon and look at the actual damage.<br /><br />Yes it may seem unimpressive that the weapon has no stats, but as a critadin, I can tell you that I was doing 1600 damage because of my critical strike and seal of command. The average swing is 300 damage. For all other classes this weapon is a waste, because you can never use it to its potential.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found mine off a stone watcher down at uldum (Tanaris) with seal of command ive already hit 1000!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>with a warrior this weapon becomes the ultimate dot booster this is because all bleeds and rends stack on this chance on hit.<br /><br />With the weapons dot alone u wil see around 54 damage every 3second (not meant to be exact but a rather educated estimation).<br /><br />that with you deep wounds dealing its 60 percent of weapon damage and you rend (asuming you in arms spec) u will do total dot damage of 175 (from rend) + 560 (from weapon proc) + 120 (deep wounds) = 855 at lvl 44.<br /><br />this combined with the 47 dps and your attack powers averege dps (mine is like 27) . over a 30 second time frame your looking at over 5.5k damage assumine u crit more then once every 30 seconds and always have a rend applied to target.<br /><br /><b>I would recommend a crusader enchant or a stat bonus enchant on this weapon as firey and weapon damage enchants are rather dull on slower weapons</b><br />(the math in this post is estimations rounded off due to experience playing as a warrior. It was no calculated down to the last 0.1 dps so if u have any objections work it out for yourself)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First off you all must understand that this weapon is not worth buying unless you plan on making a 49 twink or doing BGs because at 51 you can get IB Spear for free, which is better.&nbsp; DO NOT BUY THIS WEAPON FOR PVE! It is 200g+ because of its PvP capabilities.<br /><br /><b>PALLY</b> - A 49 twink pally with this will PWN.&nbsp; Pallies need the BIGGEST SLOWEST weapons they can find for increased seal of command proc rate and higher seal of command dmg. AND with a fiery enchant (which can trigger SoC) pallies can get INSANE burst dmg, sometimes higher than warriors.&nbsp; THIS IS A GOOD PALLY WEAPON, but not for PvE.&nbsp; <i>Just note - If you're getting this with a pally, GET FIERY ENCHANT, not crusader.</i><br /><br /><b>WARRIOR</b> - Similarly to pally, this is the ultimate weapon for 49 warrior twinks, because of its high dmg.&nbsp; Forget the chance hit altogether, its all about MS, Overpower and Axe Spec.&nbsp; MS and overpower are based on <b>WEAPON DMG</b> therefore you will get your biggest hits with this weapon.<br /><br /><i>Once again, DO NOT buy this for PvE OR for the chance hit, as it doesnt proc much.&nbsp; And if you plan on leveling past 49 without doing more than a week of PvP, i STRONGLY SUGGEST you do not buy this weapon at all.&nbsp; Ice barbed spear is MUCH MUCH better.</i></div>

Still using it at lvl 56 with a fiery enchant and will use it until I hit 58 and have my AR made. Awesome axe! liked it better than the Lord alexanders axe as the stats are nice but the damage done by Kang is way better than the LA axe! It procs often much to the regret of clothwearers everywear!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I originally posted this way down the thread, but I think it is worth saying at the top. This weapon is great for a hunter! Let's consider why:<br /><br />Wrongheaded argument 1: hunters should only care about stats (particularly agility). Ha ha! If you are fighting mobs, a little agility makes no difference because mobs are stupid and you just stand back and kill them. If you are fighting PvP and players are so stupid that let you stand back and shoot them, they will also die. But most players understand that they should close in and engage you, either casting in your dead zone or doing hand-to-hand combat. All that agility is worth ZERO at that point, which is where you will find yourself constantly in PvP.<br /><br />Wrongheaded argument 2: hunters can't/don't/shouldn't melee. See above--everyone will want to melee you (except other hunters). Since you can't avoid melee, what should you do? If you have the savage strikes talent, your crit chance is raised by 20% for the raptor strike you can do every 6 seconds. Make it count--get a big, slow weapon that will crit for a lot of damage. When they close in on you, take that raptor strike swing for 25-30% crit chance and make it count! Then hit them with a wing clip (which is instant cast) and run. Using a slow weapon is fine because you will be running around between strikes, and all you care about is big damage when you do take a swing.<br /><br />Wrongheaded argument 3: Hunters shouldn't get warrior/rogue weapons. Since rogues favor fast weapons, I would agree. I also wouldn't bother with any dual wield combinations (despite the populatity of such things in the hunter world, ostensibly to get the max +30 agility enchanting--see argument 1). But hunters need the biggest, meanest 2-hand weapon they can wield. That does put them in conflict with many a mighty warrior. Okay, if the weapon is better than what a warrior already has, let him have it. But if the melee guys already have something better, the hunter deserves to get a shot at a good high damage 2-hander. In a PUG, people are going to be jerks about it. But a guild is just shooting themselves in the foot to deny a high crit weapon to their hunters, especially if they do PvP.<br /><br />Kang the Decapitator is a great weapon for a hunter. The only alternative I would consider in the 40-49 range is the stoneraven <a href="/classic/item=13059/stoneraven">Stoneraven</a> That has almost as high damage and great stats and is easier and cheaper to acquire. But like I said, if you don't melee (PvE carebears), stats aren't that a big a deal anyway. If you do PvP, getting the bleed proc on your opponent really hurts and I would trade it for the stats any day. Why? Raising your average DPS a couple of points won't kill anyone very often, but getting Kang's proc will kill people quite often. Almost winning but losing 99% of the time isn't as good as almost losing but proc'ing for the win 10% of the time. You just raised your victory percentage by an order of magnitude in melee combat!<br /><br />(If you are tempted to say that the proc is 5%, remember that procs scale by weapon speed. 10% is probably a reasonable estimate, and it could be higher given how slow the weapon is. That is another nice thing about hunters using a slow weapon with a good proc--they get more bang for their buck on the few swings they take in melee combat!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hiya this is my first post but I've been readin posts on this site for over a year. I have come into possession of Kang and I want to sell it to anyone that wants it. Price is 145g which is far cheaper than the current AH price and I am hopping that this will sell it fast. Price is negociable so if you want it pst me Wraithguard on the Draenor server or send me mail with your offer and Ill COD it to you with your 30 copper back. Thanks to anyone who sends me an offer because I need the money and want someone to be able to flaunt this kick butt weapon!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this at around 52 off a dwarf in blasted lands. I decided to equip it. I had been specializing in swords, and using the Blade of the Titans - focusing mostly on stamina and strength equip (Bear).<br /><br />My question is twofold:<br />1) Should I not be using this weapon as I am a 54 warr now?<br />2) Should I respec and re-equip with agility? Also I'm arms/fury - mostly arms.<br /><br />I guess the other option is move on to a different weapon (Twig of the World Tree perhaps?) and keep Kang for PVP. Oh I added a Fiery because I had a little extra cash, and it was cheap (20g). Obviously Crusader is better - but I don't want to spend 150+g if I shouldn't be using this weapon from now on.

It hitted the deer for 600 and it lost only 2% of its life! It taked couple of hours to win the battle and when i did it, there was like 300 ppl watching me to kill that damn deer! AND WTF HE DROPPED A DAMN STAR RUBY! And few silver! And when i killed it some guy named Son of Golden Deer comed to me and it sayd &quot;Well done young priest, now you have beaten the mighty golden deer of the hinterlands and now your the king of this shattered land.&quot;, then he just disappeared and everyone around he clapped and hoorayed! (YAY!) Then i goed to Revantusk Village and goed to sell that ruby (thats really common on my server) and WTF, i could buy this pretty for only 17g (i was revered to Revantusk Village when i killed the deer), so i buy it and gived to my friend who was hunter!

So right now my 41 pally is using a green for 3 more levels till i can use this. The guy has had Kangs in the AH for like a week and im the first to bid on it.. i told him i would give him his min asking if he could send it right away but he was kinda a @#$% to me and said he wanted to let the auction ride. What a loser. I bid on Kang, and bought a truesilver plate for my RET pally.. it's gonna be a nice day when i hit 44... lol.. oh yah i also spent the 35g and bought the enchant mats for fiery.

When i was going to hunt some Savage Owlbeast, i saw that gold glowing deer (YES, a gold glowing deer), but i dont remember it name, so i buffed myself and goed to kill it, i started to cast mind blast and when it hit, it charged me right away when the blast hit it and critted me for 2k!(OMG 2K!), coz i had so good reflexes i drinked a combat potion (which you get when your Stone Guard(rank 6)), and it CRITTED me for 3k!(OMG 3K!), then i just casted priests imbashield and started to cast another mind blast. It hitted the deer for 600 and it lost only 2% of its life! It taked couple of hours to win the battle and when i did it, there was like 300 ppl watching me to kill that damn deer! AND WTF HE DROPPED A DAMN STAR RUBY! And few silver! And when i killed it some guy named Son of Golden Deer comed to me and it sayd &quot;Well done young priest, now you have beaten the mighty golden deer of the hinterlands and now your the king of this shattered land.&quot;, then he just disappeared and everyone around he clapped and hoorayed! (YAY!) Then i goed to Revantusk Village and goed to sell that ruby (thats really common on my server) and WTF, i could buy this pretty for only 17g (i was revered to Revantusk Village when i killed the deer), so i buy it and gived to my friend who was hunter!

The Icebreaker has higher DPS, and as long as it proc'd 3-4x in 30 secs (which seems conceivable esp for a shaman who gets extra hits from windfury) the proc would add up greatly.

They all need it in sort of diffrent ways. Warrior uses it constantly. Paladin just auto-attack and heal (gotta have some DPS). Shaman ( Enhancement) Shocks, mellee, heals. Hunter goes mellee in many fight's (when people get to close) and then it's important with a fresh and high DPS weapon. Anyway, if people chooses to use this weapons then it's their choise. And no one here can force them not to.</div>

It's a crazy low proc chance, the bleed is barely noticeable when WF procs and deletes the target. It's not even that good in PVP and you will NOT get the proc in a short fight. I'd say don't waste the $, get the mace from Maradon. For Orcs: get Gatorbite Axe from Mara, Same effect but with higher proc rate and 4 less dps. <br /><br />IMO NOT WORTH! TRASH AXE</div>
