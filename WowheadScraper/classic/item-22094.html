Single pull them and its yours.<br /><br />I got 3 out of it.<br /><br />I'm combat spec rogue, so I used deadly poison and offhanded crippling. At 10% they all flee so you want to maintain some form of snare on them. I had a couple flee into terrain I where I couldnt loot them.&nbsp; I basically stunlocked them because they hit really hard even when disarmed. <br /><br />Myrmadons hit hard hit fast and have a knockdown. I had to pot with them sometimes if I didnt get some lucky stuns.<br /><br />Serpent Guards have a disarm ability. So be careful.<br /><br />Warriors Hamstring and Mortal Strike.<br /><br />Sirens are shadow based casters.<br /><br />Sorceresses are frost based.<br /><br />It is a viciously long run for horde so dont die.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To those of you druids out there that don't know how to solo elites, use Entangling Roots + Starfire. Works best if you put your balance gear on and use innervate if you have it, or use mana potions if you don't have the mana pool for it. It's kinda like soloing those elites in Un'Goro, except with stronger mobs around that you don't want to aggro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In addition to the location stated earlier bloodkelp baskets are found at the following locations.<br />77, 19 inside a building<br />76, 18 bottom of a tower</div>

I stayed on the first strip, mainly b/c it took so long to kill one.&nbsp; By the time I was at the end of first area more were re-spawning behind me.&nbsp; Took me about 2 hours to get 13, so I plan on hitting it up again today. gg gl hf</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These are pretty much the only elites i can solo as holy priest with some damage gear from pvp, AV and some other +damage/healing items. No epics, except from this questline<br /><br />My Tactics as undead priest:<br /><br />I made sure my Devouring Plague and Inner focus had cooled down. You carefully watch the patrolling dragons and as soon they are clear. You start with holy fire on a Naga, followed by shadow pain and devouring plague. I keep smiting them untill shield runs out, i reshield and keep smiting. Shield runs out again, but now i got weakened soul. I fear and keep smiting. By the time he's back, I can reshield and throw more smites at him till he is dead. The naga are far apart enough to allow a safe fear, and if you keep an eye on the patrols, they wont bother you either. I had no problems with any type of mob, sorcerers, warriors, guards, sirens all went down. <br />Had a few deaths, because i became careless and started pulling dragons with fear.<br /><br />Little trick i did with the cabins. In some cabins there are 3 Nagas inside. I mindcontrol one at the door and let the other 2 kick the hell out of him till he's dead. Now i got 2 left and i run away. Nagas are slow so that isn't a problem. After they have repositioned you can mind control one again and then you try to do as much damage with him on the other naga. Most of the time my MC runs out when one is on 10% health and the other is 40%. I throw one shadow pain on the 10% and smite the other to death. Blizzard seems to disallow to loot MC victims, so in this scene you can only loot the last one. But the bonus is, you can now loot the basket! Which made it all worthwhile.<br /><br />Just my 2cts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1. Be prepared ! Bring yer Reagents,bandages and food.<br />2. Pickpocket the naga - the extra health pots dont hurt<br />3. Time your attacks with the patrols - they hurt<br />4. Stay away from the weavils - there evil :/<br /><br />Stick to the caster naga there a lot easier than the melle, also stealth about and look for the baskets of bloodvine 1-2 around the island, 2 spawn at any one time respawn rate is around 5 min. Ive seen them spawn near the base of the ruined tower (this required a sap and a blind, loot then vanish) down near the tide lord behind a gate and at various spawn points outside the wooden huts filled with naga</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1. Kill a mob at the end of a patrol run<br />2. Kill patrol in the space you just cleared<br />3. Work your way up the path, be sure to pull the Sirens as far as you can because when they MC you, you'll follow them until it cancels.<br /><br />(by kill I mean root+starfire+root+starfire...)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just soloed this as a rogue, didn't have to kill a single mob, and I never died. Took about an hour, just patiently going around to all the places the baskets spawn. I have improved sap, so that helped. Used vanish only 4 times. Places where there was 2 mobs guarding one basket I just had to distract one and sap the other, and simply loot the basket. Got an average of 2-3 per basket, only once did I find one with only one. Tip: if your sneaky with your camera angle, you can actually loot some of the baskets THROUGH the building walls and avoid the naga entirely. Found 3 locations where this was possible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was able to solo these naga as a warrior, however they are a bit dangerous.<br /><br />The sirens and sorceress's are shadow priests and mages, respectively, so not too difficult, as long as you hit your pummels you should kill them no prob.&nbsp; The Guardians (i think?) can disarm, but also not much of a problem, you can just piercing howl them or hamstring them and retreat a bit, then continue when the disarm effect expires, assuming you don't have disarm immunity.&nbsp; Myrmidons have a knockdown and a cleave, i would avoid them unless you have a potion up, i was able to kill one with a heal pot and retaliation, but otherwise they're tough.&nbsp; Warriors are doable if you thunderclap them and keep your rage up and kite a bit between mortal strike cooldowns, but they hit kinda hard.&nbsp; Try to stick to the 59s when killing melees, the 60s and 61s are rough unless you have retaliation or recklessness up.<br /><br />Done with the heroism gear that i got to this point, rest valor, and a TUF.<br /><br />had to pop a potion here and there if i mis-timed a pummel, otherwise not too bad.&nbsp; watch out for the hydra patrols tho, you won't be soloing those...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>are the bloodkelp bop or can i farm them with my mage or maybe even pick them up in the ah?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Not that difficult. Im prot spec. I stun them once and heal myself twice... after that they are downed.<br />Btw they are runners so keep justice on them when they reach 2k life... if you get more than 1 at a time.. your dead.<br />Shield hasn't been nessessary at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>10/41/0 spec<br />I judged and sealed wisdom for each fight. Used conc aura. Along with spiritual focus gives 100% (actually 105%) uninterrupted heals. No matter what your spec is, you can't outhit these guys, feasibly. I dinked away at them and kept holy shield active. Don't bother with flash of light--it's just not time efficient as much as you'll be getting hit. When you get low pop a heal and keep going. You should be fine on mana if you keep your seal up. Quite frequently you can stun 2 or more times a fight. It's not the quickest way to kill one, but it minimizes downtime and materials used, like water, bandages, etc. At the end of the fight, flash heal up to near full health, and you should still have about 70-80% mana if you didn't waste any during the fight. If you're soloing this, like we paladins solo so many things, you're going to be there a while (took me about 3 hours), so minimizing your downtime/consumables is a good thing.<br /><br />You can go down in the sewer if you want--things are a little calmer down there, and you can fight a 62 elite boss guy that has a higher droprate for the bloodkelp (don't worry, he's relatively weak--easier than anything outside). Problem is, you'll probably have to fight a little gnome minion guy to get down there. He can be soloed, but it takes a really long time--he hits hard and has a lot of hp.<br /><br />Good luck, you're nearing the end of the chain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>60 rogue, on upgrade quests, so i have pre mc kit . all mobs are elite. i managed to kill 59&amp;60 naga warriors and serpent guards using crippling and stun lock, 59,60 and 61 sorceress were really easy with stuns, kicks and mind numbing poison, the 59 and 60 sirens with shadow damage were absolute feckers though, swp, mind blast all spells seem instant so could not interupt them.<br /><br /><b>getting the bloodkelp solo is straightforward as a 60 rogue with average kit</b>.<br />sirens = shadow damage <br />warrior/serpent = melee <br />sorceress = frost/arcane <br /><br />watch for hydra patrols. did find the odd basket with bloodkelp in, 61's sap easily if needed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Spent about 3 hours at alcaz solo.<br />Mobs are very hard.<br />Killed about 60 of the monsters and got my 20 bloodkelp.<br /><br />Also, I found three baskets of bloodkelp.
