<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>can these still be turned in?&nbsp; I don't even have one yet but want to build rep w. stormwind.&nbsp; They moved the collectors - so now the stormwind cloth collector on Khaz Modan is in the Mage Quarter upstairs in the tailoring place.<br /><br />so I'm buying and turning in cloth to build reputation - but it's confusing - should I still be hoping to get signets or is that just for the war effort?<br /><br />and what are the horde signets I get to collect after a kill in pvp&nbsp; - ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hey! this &quot;forum&quot; wasnt about repairing items=)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If the Ahn'Qiraj event has already appeared on &lt;Name&gt; Server then shoulden bizzard remove all things related to it... cause i dont see any sence in a Npc standing with this blue ! above him in if saying &quot;Hey give me some Commendation Signets, that u cant get anymore and then ill give u a revard 8D&quot;... and then when a new player sees this, ofc he thinks &quot;Hey i want to get som commendation signets&quot; and the first thing he does is probably to go to thottbot and ask &quot; Where do i get Commendation signets?&quot; REMOVE EM FFS damn npc.. D:</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>IF for some reason you still have these signets you can turn them in at the commendation officer.<br /><br />The commendation officers for the alliance are located at: <br /><br />Stormwind-- Near the bank and the fountain. <br /><br />Ironforge-- The officer is in The Great Forge. I don't remember where, but I know he's there. Circle around until you find him. He's a dwarf, doesn't wander. <br /><br />Darnassus-- You can find the night elf commendation collector at the ring on which the bank is. <br /><br />Gnomeregan-- The Gnomeregan exiles commendation officer is in Ironforge, in the Tinker Town district. The only point in donating to this guy is if you're a dwarf and want to write a Mechanostrider.<br /><br />Like other people have stated, you won't be getting these--most likely. This post was to remind people that if you still infact have these signets you can turn them in at the above locations.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yeah, they dont exist anymore, but i really want them =\ when i first started playing i really enjoyed getting stuff to trade in for signets, i was a noob and didnt have much insight on rep, so i wasted a good 50 or 60 signets on war effort boxes, but now if i had the oppertunitiy id get myself 500, lol and get my NE exalted in sw, =) i kinda wish the AQ, or somthing similar would come back, or at least an alternative to get the signets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If this is related to a server-wide one-time event i don't understand why there are still commendations officers in all the major cities, including the Exodar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can any one ple tell where i can get them from !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You gain like: 50-75 rep (something like that)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How do you get the signets now that the NPC's are no longer there?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you gain 5 rep per 1 hand in <br /><br />or hand in 10 get 75 rep</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where can you get these now that there is not any turn in for the War?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How do I get hold of them?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>someone said the NPCs for doing quests to get the Alliance Commendation Signets do not exist on PVP servers. Can anyone confirm if this is true, and if so how do people on PVP servers do these qeusts?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You can turn these in at 5 places.<br /><br />* Representatives from each racial faction (four in all) will take these either one or ten at a time, and give faction for that race.<br /><br />* The main Silithus war leader will take them thirty at a time, for package containing a L50-L55 green item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>164284</b></h3>For anyone looking for what reputation you gain with each faction in <b>2020</b>, it worked like this:<br /><br /><ul><li>handing in <b>1 signet</b> granted 5 reputation with a particular faction</li></ul><br /><ul><li>handing in <b>10 signets</b> granted 75 reputation with a particular faction</li></ul><br /><br />I have been looking all over for this information, but have pieced this together from random websites.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aloradus</b></h3>July 2020<br /><br />Ironforge: Officer Ironbeard. He's just around the right corner of the doorway<br />outside The High Seat room, opposite the Great Anvil.
