<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Both Nikiyaki and Jimi are incorrect, as they would know from a simple test.&nbsp; Nikiyaki is much closer to the truth, however.<br /><br />For example, as a druid with over +450 healing power gear in my bank, I can tell you that Rejuvenation, to choose an instant-cast HoT spell, takes exactly 80% of the bonus, and then splits it across all the ticks.&nbsp; Not &quot;negligible&quot;, by any means, but still not the full amount.<br /><br />Having never played a priest, I cannot give you their percentages, but notice that Renew gives you an <i>exact</i> amount of healing per cast.&nbsp; As such, it is a simple matter to calculate the approximate contribution.<br /><br />It is a much more complicated matter when heals with ranges are used.&nbsp; In this case, we have to put our faith in Blizzard, which said about the same thing as Niki.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been testing with +150 on healing spells.<br />Prayer of healing was healing a roughly estimate average of 40 more than what it should.

It attracts alot of attention for one, and secondly, it helps out alot for the healing. +77 to heals on my weapon. insane. helps me get off those 4k+ crit heals. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You only get 43% of the benefit on a 1.5 second cast, but you can cast 2.3 times over the same 3.5 seconds. That still translates to getting the same bonus over the same amount of time. Arguing that faster heals don't get as much of a bonus is inaccurate, because faster heals can be landed more often than slower heals, thus the very reason they cannot benefit from the full effect.<br /><br />It's all the same.<br /><br />That said, stacking healing gear should be the primary goal of a raiding paladin. While a truly great pally will have gear sets for whatever life throws, our bread and butter is spamming flash heal on the raid. <br /><br />I tank boss adds in MC on occasion, and do what little DPS I can when I am not consumed by either healing or tanking. I am specced 31 into protection for the occasions that i do get to tank ( because it's my favorite thing to do on my pally), but my +350 healing on my gear, and 20 points in holy, along with my healing techniques, leave me as a constant #1 on the healing charts in my raids. + healing is awesome for pallies because Flash of Light is so very mana efficient. When we're able to approach the effectiveness of a priest's flash heal, with a spell that costs less than half the mana, we suddenly become an unstoppable health battery, both in PvE, and PvP (I wear the same gear for both, usually)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Some previously posted, asking is this really worth giving up 9+ int for, here's AN answer.<br />Most priests use the Glowing Brightwood, Argent Crusader or Trindlehave Staff - all good weps, get 9+ int on them.<br /><br />Go to DM and do a tribute run, or whatever, become king, in the tribute this drops the Brightly Glowing Stone<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18523"></a><br />In BRD the chest of seven the Hammer of grace drops<a href="/classic/item=11923/the-hammer-of-grace">The Hammer of Grace</a> your healing power enchant on this wep.<br /><br />Then go do the Scholo quest line and get the dancing sliver put 9+ spirit on it<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15854"></a><br /><br />Here's how it goes, start with your 9+ int enchanted wep, and once a few heals have been cast, you no longer need your top mana, so switch to the healing weps - the hammer and stone.<br />When your oom switch to the Dancing Sliver to regen, as it gives and extra 7 mana per tic over the other staves.<br /><br />When you start healing again, switch to the healing weps and keep repeating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The enchant glows a faint white in the 1.5.0 patch.
