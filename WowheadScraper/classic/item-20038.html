Agility is wonderfull for anyone that hits things, but it's \"primary\" for fury warriors, rogues and hunters. It's unfortunate that rogues and hunters have such similar wants in weapon stats and abilities but that's the way the game is. A lot of bows especially blue ones have a dps of between 30-33 dps and this has a 37.5 dps, so for anyone that uses a bow a lot, this is a wonderful increase.\nBut in saying that each point of agility benefits a rogue statisically more than a hunter, it adds more crit chance per point and everythign else is the same.\n\nSo if we sit back and think a moment, this bow is gorgeous for a rogue, hunter or fury warrior.\nThe only place to get a ranged weapon that does more damage than this is MC or the PvP one that takes 'bout a month of Pure PvP to attain.\nMy guild isn't quite big enough to do MC yet, so I can't get Strikers Mark or The hunter quest one.

In that scenario, A guild hunter should always have bidding priority. There is one huge reason why I wouldn't consider bidding on this until AFTER all present hunters had passed, the reason is that this is a ranged weapon, and as a rogue, I typically prefer not to pull, the extra tad of agro that you get is almost always enough to kill you in a second or two if you aren't careful.

Don't you think this becomes boring...?\n\n1. No bow\/gun (except from [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/search?q=Rhok'delar]Rhok'delar[\/url]&nbsp; is only for hunters. Technically hunters, warriors and rogues can roll for it and it's not without a reason: Bows\/guns have some nice stat-bonusses for all those, who can use it (in this case hunters and rogues would profit from the agility most, though the stamina is nice for all three classes)\n\n2. Bows\/guns are the main weapons for hunters, so unless they got no better one, the guild (ML) should allow the hunters to roll for it first (or spend DKPs for it). If no hunter needs it, rogues and\/or warriors can roll. \n\n3. It is impossible to \"ninja\" such a weapon&nbsp; - the only one who could, would be the Master-Looter (if you go to an instance without a Master-Looter you do not deserve it better). So if you a warrior running around with this bow - there is a reason for this... and once more - it is a very nice weapon for a rogue (agility\/stamina) and warrior (damage while pulling, stamina\/agility).\n\n4. A good guild will make sure to make all classes as efficient as possible; this means: They will give those people the weapons they need to do a good job in raids. If you are in a raiding guild that farms MC, Z'G (and does Onyxia, AQ'40 for a real challenge) everyone will get the items he want (some sooner, some later). In such a guild you may find warriors with a Mandokir's Sting or a warrior with [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/classic\/search?q=Zin'rokh,%20Destroyer%20of%20Worlds]Zin'rokh, Destroyer of Worlds[\/url], because the other members in the guild have already better (or the same) weapons... Would you rather de-enchant it, because it's not a typical class item, instead of giving it to someone who profits from the stats? \n\nDon't be selfish when you roll on items. [b]If your guild wants to be successfull you need to act as a whole.[\/b] And if you only do Zul'Gurub in pick-up groups you will not have to care about this - because Mandokir will most probably crush your raid group anyways.","date":"2006-07-31T19:30:59-05:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Theophanu","importedSubject":"...always the same..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":28,"id":2650818,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"First off, I realize there are a bunch of turds out there that like love to troll these boards and just stirr up crap saying, \"this bow only go to pally's who want to vendor\"!\n\nSee, I was just looking at the Hoodoo Hunting Bow and was seeing comments like... \"Warrior and Rogues should roll, this bow is crap for hunters.. they better off with Mandokir's sting.\"&nbsp;

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The only way a different class other than hunter should roll for this, is if no hunter in the raid needs a new ranged weapon. If another class beat a hunter on this, that would be $%^&amp;ed up. It is totally a hunter weapon, and most ranged weapons are for a hunter. No class should roll against a hunter for this, unless in some rare event the hunter didnt need or want. Hunters get viciously yelled at for rolling for almost any melee weapon. Only ones i know of are bone slitching hatches, and still as a hunter i get beat all the time on rolling for them. So people who think this isn't a hunter weapon then you got some problems.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is a hunter wep i dont care what you have to say if rogues/warriors want something good good get a fast wep with DPS like hurrican this is a pretty slow wep and how much do you guys pull really 1 a year or less? really its sad to see some of you seein you people say that....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After all the hunters in my guild got it, it finally dropped for me as well tonight :D I'm one happy rogue it's a nice upgrade from my Ancient Bone Bow.<br /><br />Yes this is clearly hunters first then rogues if the hunters don't need it :).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Although this is a good rogue bow, probably the best out there, Hunters should get first dibs for sure. I'm a rogue, and this bow would be a great upgrade from my <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37260/">Ancient Bone Bow</a>, there are hunters out there that could use that as an upgrade. I know that there are bows out there for hunters that are much better then this one, but we need to understand that not all hunters get the chance to get bows as good as this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK let's presume this weapon has no class priority.<br />During my raids (2 guild put up togheter)<br />2 weapons drops<br />Fang of the Faceless<br />Mandokir's Sting <br />We(hunters) to all pass on fang of the faceless and let that to rogues.Since they need to do their dmg.<br />But what is funny is when Mandokir's Sting&nbsp; drops<br />WArriors/rogue both classed rolled on it and guess all 4 hunters got overrolled and a rogue won the bow.<br />Little question bows that give agi/stam go to rogues/warrior? and not hunter<br />Melee weapon that gives agi/AP crit% for warrior/rogues again? and not hunter<br />Answer:With your explanation hunter don't have weapon... or maybe our pet 0_0</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sanity lacking, but a thought and hopefully small pause to the rantings (Yeah right)<br /><br />Remember there are 9 classes in the game and only 5 stats, so there are going to be a lot of double ups in abilities in what's considered &quot;primary&quot;.<br /><br />I don't personally think any class can call Stamina a primary stat because every class would like more of it. Agility is wonderfull for anyone that hits things, but it's &quot;primary&quot; for fury warriors, rogues and hunters. It's unfortunate that rogues and hunters have such similar wants in weapon stats and abilities but that's the way the game is. A lot of bows especially blue ones have a dps of between 30-33 dps and this has a 37.5 dps, so for anyone that uses a bow a lot, this is a wonderful increase.<br />But in saying that each point of agility benefits a rogue statisically more than a hunter, it adds more crit chance per point and everythign else is the same.<br /><br />So if we sit back and think a moment, this bow is gorgeous for a rogue, hunter or fury warrior.<br />The only place to get a ranged weapon that does more damage than this is MC or the PvP one that takes 'bout a month of Pure PvP to attain.<br />My guild isn't quite big enough to do MC yet, so I can't get Strikers Mark or The hunter quest one. I'm currently useing Carapace Spine Crossbow with it's amazing 31.2 dps 4 agi and 7 stam. Compared to this Bow, my bow is crap. So I'd like to think that this is a hunter preferance bow because of the DPS, secondly a rogue bow, and then thirdly a Warrior bow.<br /><br />My experience with the ML when this did drop was otherwise, it was given to a rogue without anyone being able to roll. I dislike ML more and more very time it's used.<br /><br />I'm sorry to all the warriors that your not included in my post but I know nothing 'bout being a warrior except that it's really boring at low levels.<br /><br />Charlamayne, 60 NE hunter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If a hunter needs it then well the hunter should get it since its their main weapon. if no hunter needs it then rogue/warrior should get it. The same goes for everything else. the class that depends on it should get first dibs then off to the others.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, there are 2 main scenarios here, The first, is where you are in a PUG. If you're doing a PUG, and you want to roll on an item that you can use, then you can. That's how PUGs work, and if anyone doesn't understand that, they shouldn't be in ZG.<br /><br />The second, and more common scenario, is that you are in a 20 man guild raid. In that scenario, A guild hunter should always have bidding priority. There is one huge reason why I wouldn't consider bidding on this until AFTER all present hunters had passed, the reason is that this is a ranged weapon, and as a rogue, I typically prefer not to pull, the extra tad of agro that you get is almost always enough to kill you in a second or two if you aren't careful. For me, as a 60 rogue, with a 26 hunter alt, I can really only take advantage of half of this weapon, and that's the sweet sweet stats, cause most good rogues only break stealth to drop some heavy damage or stun on a mob. Yeah, I do end up ranging the AoE bosses, and the bosses that wipe agro, but you know, my ranged DPS can never match a hunter's, so why would I steal one of the top 10 non-pvp bows in the game from them?<br /><br />Even woefully underequipped hunters can do some heavy ranged damage, I say to you, give 'em some love, and maybe they won't roll on our daggers as a reward.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got this last night.&nbsp; Yes, I am a rogue.&nbsp; Yes, I understand the hunter priority.&nbsp; However, our hunter who had been going on endless ZG runs for this bow had the dire misfortune of getting D/C'ed sas we were clearing to Bloodlord and he wasn't able to make it back until after the Bloodlord fight was over.&nbsp; Our only other hunter was an unproven lvl 59 alt who couldn't equip the bow, so the leader opened the roll to rogues as well.<br /><br />While I am satisfied with the improvement this is over the Ancient Bone Bow I had, I'm not too thrilled by the circumstances that led to my winning it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My guild has had this drop 3+ times already...2 Rogues, 1 warrior got it.&nbsp; All of our hunters have their epic quest bow or don't think it's worth the dkp spent to get it.&nbsp; However if your guild only is able to do ZG, then for sure Hunters would get dibs...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Our hunters are really happy. Has droped 4 times in a row so far.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What class gets this bow strictly depends on your guilds ability to farm MC or not.&nbsp; If your guild farms MC on a weekly basis and your hunters are in need of their epic bow quest, they'll have it soon enough so have rogues and yes, warriors roll/bid dkp on this bow is more than acceptable.&nbsp; Also, if you're guild farms MC regularly and you do give this bow to a hunter, odds are, within a few short weeks, that same hunter will either vendor this bow or disenchant it while in the hands of a rogue or warrior, it'd most likely be the last ranged weapon they'll ever need or at the very least, use it for many months.<br /><br />That being said, if your guild isn't farming MC regularly, yes, then give it to a hunter, no questions asked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This bow is 100% to hunters! We are using Ranged all the time.. Ya warriors and rouges shouldnt have it, only if the hunters didnt need it! Thats the true.. live with it ! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is rediculous, what is the debate about? Hunter is the only class that uses Bows for main DPS so of course the hunter should get it. Now if for some reason none of the hunters need this bow then by all means let the warriors and rogues roll for it, otherwise no one but the hunters who need it should roll for it. For most Hunters out there who arent in a big guild and dont run MC all the time and dont have the time to put in to get the Grand Marshal's bow, this is about as good as it gets. This is a hunters bow so teh hunters should get first dibs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>people if you think this is for MT and rrouges then shame on you. In my opinion Hunters get to have first...because it helps in MC so then they can be succesful and just think. If you let hunters get it then they get Lokdelar and then its your turn.lol sometimes i think people get to greedy with weopens<br /><br />Order:<br />1 Hunters<br />2 rouges<br />3 MT (warriors)<br /><br />rouges also get a nice boost in agi from it. if a tank wants to pull then let him get a gun or somethin.....dont try and talk to me...i aint postin here again. and if you got somethin to say to my face then talk to me on Spinebreaker troll HUNTER named Iku.<br /><br />THANK YOU VERY MUCH!<br />peace out!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have this bow on my rogue and like it a lot; however, since a melee class pretty much only uses ranged weapons for stats (exactly like hunters use melee weapons for stats), I passed on this one 3 times as some of our newbie hunters really needed the upgrade for ranged attacks. That said, I got the bow at a point where nobody really needed it anymore, and it's sweet :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why do we always have these senseless discussions about if it's a hunter, rogue or warrior item? Don't you think this becomes boring...?<br /><br />1. No bow/gun (except from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Rhok'delar">Rhok'delar</a>&nbsp; is only for hunters. Technically hunters, warriors and rogues can roll for it and it's not without a reason: Bows/guns have some nice stat-bonusses for all those, who can use it (in this case hunters and rogues would profit from the agility most, though the stamina is nice for all three classes)<br /><br />2. Bows/guns are the main weapons for hunters, so unless they got no better one, the guild (ML) should allow the hunters to roll for it first (or spend DKPs for it). If no hunter needs it, rogues and/or warriors can roll. <br /><br />3. It is impossible to &quot;ninja&quot; such a weapon&nbsp; - the only one who could, would be the Master-Looter (if you go to an instance without a Master-Looter you do not deserve it better). So if you a warrior running around with this bow - there is a reason for this... and once more - it is a very nice weapon for a rogue (agility/stamina) and warrior (damage while pulling, stamina/agility).<br /><br />4. A good guild will make sure to make all classes as efficient as possible; this means: They will give those people the weapons they need to do a good job in raids. If you are in a raiding guild that farms MC, Z'G (and does Onyxia, AQ'40 for a real challenge) everyone will get the items he want (some sooner, some later). In such a guild you may find warriors with a Mandokir's Sting or a warrior with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Zin'rokh,%20Destroyer%20of%20Worlds">Zin'rokh, Destroyer of Worlds</a>, because the other members in the guild have already better (or the same) weapons... Would you rather de-enchant it, because it's not a typical class item, instead of giving it to someone who profits from the stats? <br /><br />Don't be selfish when you roll on items. <b>If your guild wants to be successfull you need to act as a whole.</b> And if you only do Zul'Gurub in pick-up groups you will not have to care about this - because Mandokir will most probably crush your raid group anyways.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First off, I realize there are a bunch of turds out there that like love to troll these boards and just stirr up crap saying, &quot;this bow only go to pally's who want to vendor&quot;!<br /><br />See, I was just looking at the Hoodoo Hunting Bow and was seeing comments like... &quot;Warrior and Rogues should roll, this bow is crap for hunters.. they better off with Mandokir's sting.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />So I come here and I see...&quot;This bow should go to warr or Rogue because Hunters can get better Bow like Hunters Epic&quot;<br /><br />You people must have crap for brains, there will always be something better out there, that is no excuse to take over another class who needs as thier primary damage source.&nbsp; By that logic I'd still be using level 3 grey bow just one can get your +3 agi.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Also, anyone who is at this level in the game probably is fair about loot rules and such... and there are always people out there who are going to abuse the system and roll when they shouldn't.&nbsp; But realisticly, if this thing drops for a Hunter and he's got a Heartseeking Crossbow, then that hunter should get priority.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>In my guild a rogue got this over three other hunters. For each of the hunters this would have been an upgrade. The reasoning that the raid leader put forth was that this is &quot;one of the best bows a rogue can get&quot; so it automatically went to rogues only. Does this make sense to anyone? It seems like giving an item to a rogue just because of the stat bonus isn't a good way to use the item.

For noobs rogue i wanna tell them to get a look on <a href="/classic/class=5/priest">Priest</a> at Az Math #4: Best Ranged Weapons , for learn something about ranged weapon.<br />And for that one who sez in MC are better weapon then <b>Mandokir's Sting</b> i want to remember u now when we have patch 1.10 in WoW, when Aimed Shot and Multi Shot are normalized with 2.8 the <b>Striker's Mark</b> it's badness then <b>Mandokir's Sting</b> witch now is no. 12 on top of ranged weapons ( and <b>Striker's Mark</b> it's only no.15). Of cource are better weapons in Mc , but in the same time some of them are badly then <b>Mandokir's Sting</b>. So noobs Rogue and other classes ... before talk about ranged weapons and about who must have it first u must learn about them.<br /><br />PS: Rogue u need Bow only for pull , but Hunters need for dps .. so if in your guild Hunters dont have any epic bow , for goodness of guild they must have it first , and then u or Warrior.<br /><br />=================================================<br /><br />Dragonz from Faith guild on Sylvanas Server - hunter lvl 60<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 6 03:36:51 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So that was what you had, Cannonball.<br /><br />We saw you out the front holding that thing and speculated that it must be a ZG bow. We got an epic off the Bloodlord ourselves, but it was a tank sword (Bloodlord's Defender) rather than the bow.<br /><br />Gods but that fight takes a while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>many ppl how so many stupid replys here. like its a ancient bow whit 8 stamina? lol how stupid can u be,, and hurricane do more dmg then that its a rogue bow? LOOOL are u 11 or something? it doesnt matter if there are nicer bows or guns in MC everybody dont have the manpower to do MC,, just LOL U ARE ALL SO STUPID.. when the f*ck do warriors/rogues use ranged i have played wow since january since beta i have never seen rogues use it and only warriors i seen it only WHEN PULLING,, <br /><br />ofcoruse this goes to a hunter im not saying that just because im a hunter OMG U ARE ALL SO STUPID</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Nice bow got it today I agree with the above quite a easy encounter, the skin on the bow is kinda glitchy the string doesnt even touch the bows stick :\ shame i got it on my rogue :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Many people make the claim that this should be first to a rogue. Agi and sta are just as needed by hunters as much as rogues. However, if a rogue is only using for the enjoyment for the stats,,, a hunter should have first dibs because they will not only benifit from the stats, but the 37.5 dps is awsome. A rogue that uses a bow will shoot it once, and melee. Hunters use it as their primary source of damage. Therefore with it being much more useful for a hunter, they get first crack at it. Rogues next, and then warrriors, cos agi and sta work great for them too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My Rogue got this from Bloodlord on Whisperwind :).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunters shouldnt even think of getting any bows except there epic quest bow until they hit bwl.... leave this one for rogues/warriors</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A new weapon to grind for! Definitely a great hunter bow and very nice stats. And for all you noobs out there that say &quot;zomg don't give to hunter it rogue bow,&quot; you have got to be the dumbest person alive. You're a rogue. How often do you use a bow compared to your daggers and swords? Now think about how often you see a hunter shooting from afar. Exactly.<br /><br />Plus, the stamina is always nice for any class to have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just can't understand how on all the various bows, so many people are like &quot;This is clearly a Rogue weapon&quot; or &quot;This is so for Warriors&quot; or whatever. Look, as a hunter, I don't go around claiming that such and such a sword is &quot;clearly a hunter weapon&quot; or that such and such a dagger is &quot;such a hunter weapon.&quot; I'm a marksman spec hunter who doesn't want a super fast, lower damage bow like Hurricane because I tend to Aimed shot and Arcane shot more after I sting to take full advantage of crits. In those cases, I want the higher damage value. Plus, Agil and Stam are needs just as much by Hunters (Agil especially) as other classes.<br /><br />Overall, I just think it's silly that anyone can pin a bow or any weapon to a class. That said, though, I tend to feel certain classes should be given preference to weapons, and bows, for the most part, are a Hunter weapon and the primary way that we deal damage (at least Marksman spec). You other classes would get mad if I rolled on a quality melee weapon, after all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah i just got this last night, i like it, good ranged DPS and not 2 bad of stats 8)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got this tonight, it looks great :) and bonusses aren't bad ( Oh yes, all our hunters got Rhok and i am a rogue :P )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mungbeansss</b></h3>Unless you're a Troll hunter, Bloodseeker is better. It does more damage. In fact it does 20 more dmg on the low end. You will be clipping so many auto shots with this bow on boss fights you may as well not even use aimed shot and just rip arcane and multi shot. They could have at least made the speed 2.70 for the hunters... but i guess the intention was to let any class roll on this item. <br /><br />This weapon is too fast for hunters that raid.<br /><br />HOWEVER <br /><br />This weapon is also not that great for warriors or rogues. It is slightly better than ancient bone bow stats wise because of the stamina. But still there are so many other ranged weapons (far more common than this one) you can easily get that have better stats for you.<br /><br />ULTIMATELY<br /><br />this bow should be given to hunters to use as a back up bow for fighting Nefarian or simply for fashion.</div>
