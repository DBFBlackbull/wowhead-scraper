If you have to solo this and are only going for Honored with this faction for the enchant I would recommend possibly waiting until you are higher level. While my higher level has nerfed my ability to gain as much rep per kill\/turn-in I can grind these things one hell of a lot faster solo (as a mage) by getting more feathers than would ever be possible in a group and turning them in for much, much more rep than grinding kills. Doing a huge group grind is probably better at lower levels but with TBC out you may not be able to sustain the efficiency of a group grind like this for very long. \n\nSince the increased enchanting cap has also fragmented the market you're probably going to be selling most of these enchants to twinks from here on out. It's just not worth the excessive amount of time you will put in at lower levels if you are soloing this faction rep, in my opinion.\n\nSome people might disagree with that strategy but in all likelihood those people are going for Revered\/Exalted and want to use feathers\/beads to grind the hardest parts of this rep.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To gain faction, you can do the quests given by the furbolgs and/or just kill other furbolgs. Easiest thing is to kilkl lots and lots of Deadwood and/or Winterspring furbolgs, you get 5 reputation-points per kill. When you hit Friendly, a new killing-quest becomes available (the one in Felwood is bad, because the travelign time fromt eh southern part of the map to the furbolg to turn it in is a waste of time and drops) in winterspring. The furbolg at the winterspring-entrance aks you to kill 8 of the three types of winterspring Furbolg. Thing is, right next to him is 2 camps,&nbsp; a mage can clear both, and then they respawn by the time he/she is done. Turning the quest in gives 75 rep-points (+10% for humans ^^). I'm currently 1000 rep-points from revered with them. <br /><br />I prefer killing the winterspring furbolgs because a) they drop Winterspring Firewater which the guild tanks LOVE (I enjoy using it to get a bigger mount than gnome warlocks) and b) they are hardly ever camped by hordes like the deadwood ones are. Also, a chest spawns at the 2 camps (random which camp) around 4 times an hour and it has some nice drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No no, you're confused. Rep always goes up on the bar, not down. You're at hated but gaining rep, when the bar is full you'll get an empty bar for hostile and you'll have to fill it up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>TBC has changed a lot of things. If you have to solo this and are only going for Honored with this faction for the enchant I would recommend possibly waiting until you are higher level. While my higher level has nerfed my ability to gain as much rep per kill/turn-in I can grind these things one hell of a lot faster solo (as a mage) by getting more feathers than would ever be possible in a group and turning them in for much, much more rep than grinding kills. Doing a huge group grind is probably better at lower levels but with TBC out you may not be able to sustain the efficiency of a group grind like this for very long. <br /><br />Since the increased enchanting cap has also fragmented the market you're probably going to be selling most of these enchants to twinks from here on out. It's just not worth the excessive amount of time you will put in at lower levels if you are soloing this faction rep, in my opinion.<br /><br />Some people might disagree with that strategy but in all likelihood those people are going for Revered/Exalted and want to use feathers/beads to grind the hardest parts of this rep. For just Honored though, I'd say wait if you have TBC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In 2 Days. Lvl 70. Drop rate on feathers is about 30%. 1 rep from kill. 25 rep from Chief. <br />I came run and kill everything non-stop.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i literally just spoke with an enchanter on Dreanor who has this enchant, and she said that once you get your faction to Honored with the Timbermaw Furbolgs, they will sell you this formula.<br /><br />i asked her if there was a quicker way to increase faction, she said the only way she knows of is by killing the Furbolgs in Felwood... apparently that could take a long time, killing those furlbolgs constantly for 5-7 days straight...<br /><br />later on,<br />Rock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>All the evil furblogs give the same rep (named ones give slightly more), so you should just stick with the quickest ones to kill. Those being the ones in southern Felwood. Only problem is that with this enchant, everybody and their mother is camping them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My guild went on a timbermaw rep raid to get these agi enchants for a friend. We went into LFG and recruited and summoned anyone that wanted to go. At the peak we had 25 people and moved very fast. It took us one and a half nights of going around the lake in northern felwood killing the furbolgs as they respawned(which is dangerously fast) having a blast in general. <br /><br />I say a night and a half because a raid of horde came along and shut down our little operation so we quit for the night and did it again the next night but with less people. I would hate to grind it alone as they add like crazy and it is a popular place so it is not unlikely not to have the opposite faction show up angry when they see you killing THEIR furbolgs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You do need timbermaw faction.<br /><br />You don't have to kill only the bad furbolgs in felwood. There's also ones in winterspring.<br /><br />I've heard the following but have not verified myself, so your mileage may vary....<br /><br />You can get a quest in northern felwood (from a timbermaw outside the tunnel) to kill the southern felwood furbolgs. This nets very little faction and is considered not worth doing more than once. Just kill the furbolgs in the south until you are slightly past middle of neutral faction. Once there, head north in felwood to the same quest guy and get the quest to kill the guys on the north end of felwood. This still nets little faction but you are at least close to the guy so it doesn't take much time away from killing.<br /><br />One you are friendly (or perhaps 1/2 way through friendly?) there is supposed to be a quest to kill the furbolgs in winterspring. This is supposed to net much high faction rewards though I'm still at &quot;unfriendly&quot; after several hours so I can't verify :-) :-) I've heard 15-20 hours of faction hardcore farming will do it. I'm no where near that level of effort invested yet.</div>
