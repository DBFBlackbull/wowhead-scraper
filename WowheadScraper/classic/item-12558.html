In my experience, it only seems to drop when you have the last part of the quest chain requiring you to kill the Berserk Owlbeasts. At this point, the drop rate appears to be something around 80%, but since you only need to loot one, and the whole party can loot it, you're going to leave many behind.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>27233</b></h3>There may be a bug in getting this drop.<br /><br />I tried getting this drop for 1,5 hour constant grinding on these owls. I had the quest with killing Berserker Owlbeasts.<br /><br />Just wondering if anyone else have experienced this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>16334</b></h3>Still isn't dropping when on the last part of the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1284</b></h3>Looks like this only drops when its dark. As previous people said it isn't the quest that makes this drop, but it was dark for me when it dropped (loads).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This drop is, I believe, only attainable while doing <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4721">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4721/wild-guardians</a>, the last of the Wild Guardians quest line.&nbsp; I killed dozens of the high-lvl Winterspring owlbeasts before I had this quest with zero of this item dropping.&nbsp; After I picked up the quest, 8/10 Berserk Owlbeasts dropped it.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i can confirm this, i grinded these for hours and hours without it dropping, then after getting the quest to kill the beserkers it was dropping every other kill</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dont know if that comment regarding the BE's not being able to get it is true, but I've been grinding on these owlbeasts WITH the quest for the last half hour or so and I've had no luck. I've also killed them without the quest and have had no luck.<br /><br />Oh, and I AM a BE (pally). Maybe it's just bad luck? I dont know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Me (undead priest) and my friend (blood elf paladin) were doing the Berserker quest. The necklace was dropping off every other owl but my friend was unable to pick it up. We've tried setting to free-for-all, tried booting and reinviting him. Nothing worked :o) Looks like Blood Elves can't get the necklace as a drop.</div>
