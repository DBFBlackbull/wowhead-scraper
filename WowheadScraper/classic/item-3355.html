This herb sells well on the AH because it is used in many alchemy recipes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just like earthroots, look near mountains. ive seen them mostly in stranglethorn, but they are hard to find.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've found it in at least two places in the Wetlands...once on the hill between the road and the dig (with all the Raptors) and once on the hill between the road and the Orc encampment...in both cases you have to sneak by mobs.&nbsp; In the case of the orcs you have to either be able to kill a few or wait till someone else does.&nbsp; Or be able to stealth in.<br /><br />Polipea - lvl 21 Druid</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>found them in mountains around duskwood</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you want to know where they grow - just scroll up to the bottom of the &quot;dropped by&quot; section and click page 2.&nbsp; On page 2 it lists regions where they are dropped - like Ashenvale and Duskwood - and you can click on a map for that region to see recent location where picked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have found Steelbloom in places like deep in Ashenvale in humanoid camps and Stonetalon Mountains.&nbsp; Also, there are some by the infernals and demons in Ashenvale.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I looked at the map and read the comments. I found none in the Wetlands. It may be that another herbalist was just a few minutes ahead of me each time. I found a lot of stranglekelp (thank you aquatic form!) and some of the boring other stuff but no, repeat no (none, nada, niente) wild steelbloom.<br /><br />Wetlands is my primary stranglekelp farming area because it's easy to get to. Oily Blackmouth and Firefins too but I have yet to find a Steelbloom in dozens of visits. Luck?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have seen Wildsteel Bloom in Ashenvale as well as back around the site for the quest with the raptors and archieologists... grows mainly around mountains from what a guildie told me. I was wondering if the map for Duskwood was accurate for as many places as they have marked for it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The best place to find Wild Steelbloom is in Stranglethorn. There are several ridges that have 3 or 4 on them at a time. Most of them are to the west where you hunt the tigers and raptors. I farmed this place for a few days and made 30+ Gold. Great place to make some money. Wetlands is the best for Stranglekelp. Just an FYI and for some reason Stranglekelp sells for for more ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yeah so i guess it is abundant in hillsbrad, but i have only found it twice, but for where they are found, ussually on mountains, whenver i see it it seems to be on like a mountin of a rocky hill, so kinda same as earthroot</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A nice place to find these is in STV right outside the instance around all the nagga.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what lvl do you need to pick this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i've been on a mission to find as much as possible, the place i have been able to pick it is wetlands (along the mountain ridge between the raptors and the orcs) sneak by the orcs if you are a rouge or like me (druid) turn into cat form and prowl.&nbsp; also there are a couple vendors that will sell 1 or 2 at a time for 2 silver, which is amazing compared to the fact that on my server wild steelbloom goes for about 8 gold for 20. anyways, its always good to get them because they help make elixir of fortitude (which on my server goes for 5.5g for 5)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i would have critizied about some other herb,bit even i have to admit this herb makes a few good pots, which i used to use,but finding the damn herb was hard enough,but for other ppl's information this herb grows in ceratin places, like all herbs do for example to all you beginner herbalists out there, briarthorn grows near trees, Fadeleaf grows underneath bushes, Wild steelbloom grows on mountains, Goldthron grows on mountain hillsides too ect.<br />and places to pick it i have found are Wetlands although if you arnt a rogue or druid you might have troubles, duskwood i have only ever found 2 there and you still have to pass mobs to get them, and i remember seeing some in Badlands, near Rock Elementals.<br />PS- this is my list of places I THINK you should farm at ceratin lvls, 10-19,Westfall and Redridge,<br />20-29 Wetlands(remember to go underwater for your stranglkelp, 30-39 Southshore,Hillsbrad Foothills and arathi highlands,40+ Swamp Of Sorrows,badlands, if you choos this please choose alchemy, dont think it wastes herbs because if you cant find a buyer for ceratin herbs then use them to make usefull pots that may save your life, and soon you can make,Goblin Rocket Fuel,which oes for a tidy sum,of x20 for 17-25g on my server, and you can soon make stonescale oil, which can go for loads aswell, so its the perfect combo!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>nobody go pick this....this is my fortune!<br /><br />ok, honestly, there's a ton of it in arathi highlands<br /><br />like people have stated, it grows along the mtns, so if you do laps, and hug the mtn you'll gather a few stacks within a few hours. after about 2 laps it'll start to respawn in the original spots from lap 1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone above seems to miss the '<u>Source</u> <b>Vendor</b>, Drop'<br />on the item listing.<br />For example Kixxle sells wild steelbloom for 2s from a wagon at the intersection of the roads in Wetlands. It is limited supply, but seems to almost always be there (in my experience).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so whos the loser who submitted the kingsblood for the screenshot?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was wondering about that screenshot as well! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>there are alot of them in thousand needles</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I do not have herbalism, therefore I need to buy it. There is none in the AH everytime I check, the vendor listed does not currently have any due to limited quantity, and no one I ask will pick some for me even though I'm willing to pay. Can someone plz tell me somewhere else I can buy other than in the wetlands?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you should have taken up herbalism i guess. it only makes sense if you want to be an alchemist. i have seen it at vendors so look there i guess it's your only shot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can occasionally buy this in the Fragrant Flowers in the Canal District of Stormwind.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've found that it spawns in reasonable quantities on the little rocky hillocks in Hillsbrad. Just wander around between the coast and the main road and you're likely to find some.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found a ton of this stuff in the southern barrens on my way to 1,000 needles where I found more there also.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>whatsoever</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Have anyone ever found wild Steelbloom in Undercity?<br /><br />They're listed as drops around or in the Royal Quarter, where they should be found on skeletons and off voidwalkers.<br /><br />Voidwalkers?<br />Voidwalkers don't leave drops!<br />And I've never seen skeletons lying around in the Royal Quarter.<br /><br />Is this perhaps an old list? Maybe made from a test-realm?<br /><br />I'm just wondering.<br /><br />Zauil.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This spawns in ~20+ areas where the terrain is mountainous. This means it could be high in some mountains (most often) or just near the base of some higher hills.<br /><br />Like mining veins and earthroot, it likes to be near the cusp of a minor slope (dy/dx), it seems to me.<br /><br />Granted, all the spawn points *have* been pre-determined by the devs. This is just to give some advice/clues to those who have never found it before.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone know where to pick Wild Steelbloom?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Found it in Wetlands up by the exacavation site</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This page leads one to believe that Wild Steelbloom can be bought off a vendor. I traveled to 1000 Needles and found Montarr, but he had none on him for sale. Does he sell it only if someone sells it to him first? I did notice he did have for sale Earthroot, Kingsblood and Bruiseweed. First time to him, so not sure if this is what he stocks normally, or someone sold it to him and he is trying to make a buck...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These are shown as drops, but they are gathered... where are the maps showing where you can gather them?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BLazeddruid</b></h3>115 Herbalism skill needed to pick Wild Steelbloom.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WhozCraig</b></h3>If these drop zones look weird above, it's because you're looking at the wrong item. These are all 'purchase' points (vendors, some of which have extravagant paths).
