If a Guild is doing an MC run, usually the goal is to get a weapon like this or gets the mats for it. And generally, it's for one or two specific people. That's how rolls are determined.\n\nB. Agreeing with the poster waaaay up there, there aren't enough Paladins who use their Judgments. Use them! Each Judgment is designed to go along with another one of your attacks, generally speaking. Example: Judgment of Crusader adds on to any Holy damage done. Add that to Seal of Command and suddenly you and everyone else (who can use Holy attacks) is doing that much more damage! I played with another Pally last night and he couldn't figure out how I was able to do nearly 500 dmg with Verigan's Fist at level 32. Well, 350 Holy crit + 150 normal damage = 500, and one very dead Dark Iron Dwarf. He also didn't think that if he used the Judgment of Light that everyone in our party might be able to gain life back from attacks, not just him! \n\nC. Just like D2, this game is about planning your abilities ahead of time. I didn't use a single talent point until level 22 because I wanted to wait and find out what would aid me best in a tough battle. \n\nAnyway, on topic, this weapon would be good for anyone that 1) can use it, and 2) has specced the character to best take advantage of its properties. Which, by all accounts, can be said about any Epic weapon.\n\nOh, and by the way, just because it's good in PvP doesn't mean it has to be used in it.

The burst damage on the reaper and the force are nice for pvp, but can be devistating in pve (drawing mass amounts of aggro on your first hit...) not to mention the lack of stats gimps you in the long run, as your main priority is healing, no matter what instance you are running. Instead, this weapon delivers more damage over time, rather than at bursts like the reaper.\n\nAlthough the reaper\/force will hit harder when WF procs, this weapons WF will proc more often, ultimately equaling out the speed\/dps difference. The only way the reaper\/force can be superior in DPS is for you to get really lucky on WF procs (which happens once in a blue moon) In general, though, faster weapons will deliver more DPS.\n\nIn conclusion, this weapon is the best hands down pve dps weapon for a shaman.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>munix</b></h3>Great healing mace. Still use it in raids with +22 int enchant. The mp/5 is really nice, currently up to about 48mp/5 on my Paladin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Asher</b></h3>Great mace for druids or pallies. Throw the +22 int enchant on it and you'll be fine for raiding. Also a good FR addition for healers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7308</b></h3>A very good mace for shamans, druids or paladins, the best effective enchant is +22intellect since this mace is usually used for FR Gear. FR Gear means gimp in stats, and +22 int (+330mana) can be a lifesaver.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7047</b></h3>Put a spirit enchant on this, and you've got a great regen weapon for those super long fights. Great for druids, and not too shabby for pallys, either!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8403</b></h3>This weapon is great for any of the hybrid classes. Druids, shamans, and paladins are all able to use this, and all of them could largely benefit from the stats on this. The +9 mana/5 seconds is probably one of the strongest mana regens on any weapon at this point in the game. If you're a druid, paladin, or shaman, you'd be smart to go after this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is druid, paladin or shaman<br />paladins will never be in a group with a shaman, but if a paladin ninja's this from the horde, give him props, and ask him <b>how the hell he did it</b> (and vice versa), in my opinion though, druid makes the most use, increased healing, mana, and it is a massive life boost in DB form, and they can not use shields.... so yeah....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is possibly the funniest item thread on thottbot.&nbsp; It seems like there's an argument over whether Paladins or Shamans should get this.&nbsp; Classic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Last time i thought, this was to review the weapon. Unfortunatly, a bunch of nerds with too much time on their hands decided to screw around. So instead of wasting my time and reading all this bs, I'll just say this: ITS A GAME. You got ganked by a pally/shaman once or twice, good for you, so havent we all. So instead of complaining just play the game, that's what it was made for and that what you should do. Anyway what exacly is the best weapon for a druid? This on looks good but i've seen better....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A. If a Guild is doing an MC run, usually the goal is to get a weapon like this or gets the mats for it. And generally, it's for one or two specific people. That's how rolls are determined.<br /><br />B. Agreeing with the poster waaaay up there, there aren't enough Paladins who use their Judgments. Use them! Each Judgment is designed to go along with another one of your attacks, generally speaking. Example: Judgment of Crusader adds on to any Holy damage done. Add that to Seal of Command and suddenly you and everyone else (who can use Holy attacks) is doing that much more damage! I played with another Pally last night and he couldn't figure out how I was able to do nearly 500 dmg with Verigan's Fist at level 32. Well, 350 Holy crit + 150 normal damage = 500, and one very dead Dark Iron Dwarf. He also didn't think that if he used the Judgment of Light that everyone in our party might be able to gain life back from attacks, not just him! <br /><br />C. Just like D2, this game is about planning your abilities ahead of time. I didn't use a single talent point until level 22 because I wanted to wait and find out what would aid me best in a tough battle. <br /><br />Anyway, on topic, this weapon would be good for anyone that 1) can use it, and 2) has specced the character to best take advantage of its properties. Which, by all accounts, can be said about any Epic weapon.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, just because it's good in PvP doesn't mean it has to be used in it. Not all players do PvP.<br /><br />And I thought racism in the REAL world was bad..sheesh.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's a good thing that this has flame resist on it; I feel crisped just reading this entry!<br /><br />It drops from Majordomo's chest.&nbsp; It's certainly not a 100% drop rate because we didn't get it this weekend.&nbsp; :-(<br /><br />This weapon is very good for Paladins.&nbsp; Int and mana regen are the two most important things to get.&nbsp; And because we rarely do any tanking in MC, wielding a 2-hander is just fine.&nbsp; We do occassionally melee; mostly on the Lava Spawns and other trash mobs.&nbsp; This would be a great help with Onyxia, since we melee in phase 1 and 3.<br /><br />Paladins need good fire resist for Ragnaros.&nbsp; We've got to stay up close with the tanks in order to keep Fire Aura on them, so we need survival there too.&nbsp; Drop a +22 Int enchant or a +healing enchant on this and it's awesome.&nbsp; Of course, all this goes for Shamen as well.<br /><br />If priests or druids can wield 2-h maces, then it's a good choice for them also.&nbsp; But since they melee less, your group would probably do better giving this to a Paladin.<br /><br />The +fire resist and the high damage is good for Warriors, though I'm not sure how the speed normalization in v1.8 is going to affect the damage output for them.&nbsp; However, I think warriors have more choice of good +fire resist armor than Paladins do, so I would hope that your group would consider that when passing out this hammer.</div>

This said however I read Molten core drops to find another solution in Malistar's Defender &amp; Aurastone Hammer for the healerdin.<br /><br />The stats are very close. First thing I see is the fact that the mace and shield option win for the out and out healer with an extra +5 mana regen and +25 healing. This being said how ever and looking at the situation more practicly I ask my self what I am actualy doing in the big raids? Yes healing is by far top priority but I am offtenly walking up to the front line to have a bash huh. Most dam in MC is fire dam in any case so armor looses relivance but gives finkles the edge. The finkles also has a +6 stam advantage.<br /><br />Also consider the dkp savings from finkles instead of 2 epics, the fact that its an awsome pally solo weapon and the fact that I have never used Seal of Crusaider making weapon speed irelivant and the fact it looks way cool, and well .. my mission in life is back to getting finkles. :D</div>

I thought I should have gotten it first, and I did. :)<br /><br />The mana on it was bugged for me, also. I'd get the int. credit from it but no boost in my mana pool. I think it is working alright now, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>acschroeder, its a quest gun for stratholme. After you complete the quest you get to keep the gun, it destroys some annoying NPC mobs in strat. Im a pally, have one too. Only ranged slot item pallys and druids can use so we just keep it equiped constantly.<br /><br />That aside that is a SWEET pvp weapon.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd say that it's good for a Restoration specced shaman or for a Druid. In a lot of ways it's actually better for a druid, since a druid can't use a shield.<br /><br />This is at best a mediocre weapon for an enhancement specced shaman. The attack speed is simply too fast. WF damage is based on attack power which relaes directly to weapon speed. The faster the weapon the less damage done when WF procs.<br /><br />As an Enhancement Shaman I use the Aurastone Hammer/ Draconian Deflector when I'm using a 1 hander, or a REAPER when I use a 2 hander. I really wouldn't want to waste points on this weapon.<br /><br />If you are enhancement based and don't have a Reaper, then spend your DKP points on the Earthshaker.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Why does every class in WoW figure that a specific weapon or item is for their class and that class alone. if Blizzard wanted it that way it would be locked to that specific class as i do not see Druid only or Warrior only on these items that everyone fights about. SHUT UP roll on it like everyone else and get your shot at it fairly and quit crying about it. just cause you whine jump up and down and throw fits cause a pally got this over a Druid. or any other case your not having fun with the game its only a game the loot will always be there just run the instance again and again and again to get it. thus the reason for not making it class specific. to keep people going back for more. to keep you playing so they get more $$$. While you are whining and crying here you could be running the instance to get.<br />Ohh yea i don't Play who im just a forum troll.<br />i read everyone complaining about this stuff all the time and its funny how you can tell they lost the item to the class they are saying its not ment for.</div>

Personally as a Druid I wouldnt lot on that item over Shamans in my guild because i think they will make much muhc better use of it.<br /><br />As far all Alliance go, Paladins would make better use of it in PVP combat only. Paladins lack serious DPS and something like that would benefit them greatly, whereas a Druid should be in feral form most of the time and not benefit froms its DPS.<br /><br />Just a Druid's Opinion!<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jun 20 01:20:44 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For those who've been arguing, I will throw my gas on the fire. This should inarguably go to a druid or shammy before anyone else. If I was in charge of the raid and this was in domo's chest (our last one sucked :( ) I would sooner DE it than give it to a warrior, they simply don't use 2H weapons for anything beside soloing or PvPing where they would benefit much more from a strength bonus than the fire res and completely useless int. A 2H with this much stamina and resistance (not to mention intellect) should go to a shammy or a druid who may actually use a 2H weapon in the MC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Paladin weapon first hands. We start with a mace and our pally quest is for a mace. We have +5 to maces. We us intellect jsut like any of the other classes and since we have a smaller mana pool we need it more. Druids start with a stave and can use a stave instead of a mace, we cant use staves. Druids will use the stats, and then spam root and moon fire. Pallys will use stats and the dps. If druids want a stat hammer get hammer of the grand crusader. Druids will swing it once in awhile, pallys will swing it ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />Edited, Tue May 3 12:44:07 2005</div>

I mean, your argument is that you will benefit more from the DPS than a druid.. hmm, if you don't have a shield on, you won't even be able to melee much more than a druid (regarding shamans)..<br />Personally I would be dissapointed if a paladin won this over a druid, and since I'm alliance, I don't really care about the shamans claiming this weapon..</div>

Yeah thats a decent point, but a certain amount of common sense does have to be applied to situations.<br /><br />For instance as a warrior I would have to shoot any other warrior who wanted this in the head if they went for it over any of the mentioned classes.<br /><br />Some weapons are obviously not intended for certain classes even though they can use them, warriors being a great example since they can use loads of stuff :).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>by all means this should go to a pally first. the only damage that a pally can do is in melee. and pally damage IS affectd by DPS. a druid would be better off finding another mace with intellect. if a druid in my guild took this mace over a pally, i would probably request he be kicked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>it's a good mace for shamans, paladins, AND druids. they all benefit from the stats and dps. why even argue over it? grow up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Gonna have to say good for both, but more usable by a paladin. Avoiding the stats and just going for DPS. If a paladin hits with SoC and they both crit, this item is AWESOME. Could easily crit 2k+ (added with SoC). Its definately possible since I'm only using a Barbarous Blade and have done that many of time.<br /><br />So if you want it for stats sure, goes either way. But if you have a paladin with a horrible weapon that melees/heals, dont be a jerk and let him have that good dps so you can spam Moonfire. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would like to point out to all the shaman saying that the dps on this weapon would be inferior to a reaper are wrong.<br /><br />If you were to really think about it, Windfury works with attack power yes, but unless you are attack power heavy (which most shaman are not, unless you are fully enhancement and only rely on your melee damage, which I consider a waste) this weapon is far superior to the reaper in DPS.<br /><br />I myself have an Arcanite Reaper, Lava Dredger, and an Unstopable force. The burst damage on the reaper and the force are nice for pvp, but can be devistating in pve (drawing mass amounts of aggro on your first hit...) not to mention the lack of stats gimps you in the long run, as your main priority is healing, no matter what instance you are running. Instead, this weapon delivers more damage over time, rather than at bursts like the reaper.<br /><br />Although the reaper/force will hit harder when WF procs, this weapons WF will proc more often, ultimately equaling out the speed/dps difference. The only way the reaper/force can be superior in DPS is for you to get really lucky on WF procs (which happens once in a blue moon) In general, though, faster weapons will deliver more DPS.<br /><br />In conclusion, this weapon is the best hands down pve dps weapon for a shaman. For pvp slower is always better, because of the burst factor.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Jul 26 15:49:30 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Far too fast for a SoCom Paladin. Maybe another type.. That doesn't use a shield... Hrm. Remember, it's not just min/max that affects SoCom damage, the slower the weapon the more Attack Power adds, hence Barman Shanker is the best Backstab dagger.<br /><br />Druids and Shamans are it, imho. &gt;:) Shamans even more, I think, as Amberseal Keeper is so much cooler.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jun 13 13:51:41 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is THE end game weapon for druids we will use it 24/7 and never take it off. I can't see how shamans/pallys can use this better since they will probably run MC with shield. On the other hand druids will use this when soloing/pvp/instance. So i don't buy the whole use every aspect of it. In most guilds this weapon will be druids in first hand weapon. Aurastone Hammer + Draconian is shammys first in line for. Since someone brought up druid forms, you want us to go for this and some srt/sta weapon also since we don't benefit enuff in our forms? Didn't think so. <br /><br />Edited, Wed Aug 17 17:23:57 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is definitely a shaman/paladin weapon first.<br /><br />End game, the druid is a healer/support role (if you don't believe that, you are in denial, as druids are only brought along for healing/innervate in raids). If a druid is seeking a weapon that gives them int, they should be using the argent crusader or glowing brightwood. If they seek a damage mace, they can just finish the Fordring quest for his warhammer. A paladin and shaman would use this weapon alot more than a druid standing in the back healing. It's that simple yet to say it can be used by warriors, now that's insane.<br /><br />==<br />Kereden<br />60 Human Priest - Argent Dawn<br /><br />Edited, Wed Apr 27 08:36:12 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'd like to correct the previous poster. This mace has plenty of intellect, coupled with a +9 intellect enchant this would be more than enough. There are 3 other things on this weapon that make it very Druid friendly for end-game raids. <br /><br />+25 Stamina. More health is a godsend for anyone.<br />+15 Fire Resistance. Can you say Molten Core and Onyxia with me?<br />Passive: Restores 9 mana every 5 sec. I don't know what it's like for you but some of the boss fights are pretty damn long. I've started collecting mana regeneration items to help alleviate my downtime. Less downtime = more people alive to finish the fight.<br /><br />So, I'm not saying this is a Druid only mace. I'm saying that Druids have just as much right to this item as any other class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I really think it should be paly first I'm not gona flame anyone and wish not to be OMG WTF YOUR WRONG back.<br /><br />Druids have ranged damage spells palys don't at all. There for the only time a paly can do anything is in melee and the better weapon the better.<br /><br /><u>I'm not sure about this one</u>. But I've heard druids cannot use certain items when they shapeshift. And if weapon doesn't have anything to do with animal dps another reason paly first.<br /><br />Druids would do better rolling on all cenarion set pieces as druids are probably the least played class so you will likely get lots of those set pieces anyway. And druids Don't NEED this mace to be able to deal damage(unlike palys) and use their spells more often when there are other more helpul items to druids that palys don't need.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 28 20:38:00 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok guys..first off, this my my wife's account so no laughing. Secondly, I have a 60 Paladin, and a 40 druid so can talk from both standpoints. <br /><br />Bottom line...it would probably be worth more to a Paladin..but if someone in a group whined about a Druid rolling on something that would likely be a DRASTIC improvement on their ability to do damage, I'd jump all over them regardless of which char I was on with. I hear lots of people talking about chars role's in groups, but I dont play my druid just to heal in groups...I like PKing and dueling too. Animal forms do damage based on the weapon the Druid has. Yes they have spells, but they need the weapon, can use the weapon and it would mean a great deal to any druid who does not have a 60+ dps weapon already. Anyone who whines at a druid for rolling on such a weapon is on crack...period. <br /><br />Also, anyone who said Paladins dont melee are also on crack. In groups, priests and druids primarily heal and even when I heal, Im usually swinging at something. Paladins have the plate armor for a reason folks and unless you have Holy shock, you have little to no means of doing damage unless you melee.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Here was some question what enchant to put on this. As I use it on boss fights primarly (due it having +sta) then, I personally would slamm +spi enchant for it, if be druid like me - balance or otherhand, if a druid has this, one can wait and get better +spi staff from ZG. <br /><br />Its either +spi or +int - depending of your playstyle. <br /><br />For the question, what class should have this weapon? I say - player who would use it should have it. Any player, who uses mana and can have it., Its not locked for one class and nor should raidleaders decide is it more for a pally, druid or shaman. <br /><br />I am druid, I have it and definitely it looks funny on my hand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is the difinitive Paladin weapon. Paladins by default use 2H mace, that's what they've always used, and always want to use.<br /><br />A Human Paladin should have priority on this item because it fits every category for a pally. Druid can only use the DPS during bear and cat form, and can only use the INT / Mana regen stat in humanoid form.<br /><br />This is the difinitive Paladin Weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Only the stats on weapons effect Druids in Feral form. Stamina and Intellect is ideal for any build. Druids also need DPS weapons as much as anyone else because we don't always stay in Feral forms. I prefer to stay in Caster form as long as possible due to its spell versatility.<br /><br />Since there aren't many Druids, we are pretty much guaranteed our epic set pieces. So, if we want to roll on anything else we can do so without much debate.<br /><br />Also, it's important to remember that Paladins are used as backup healers and for cleansing, in Molten Core and Onyxia's Lair, not as damage dealers. They can find a much more useful Sword for DPS. In fact, the Obsidian Edged Blade has a much higher drop rate and much higher DPS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon is great for either a druid or pally, but the fact that has nice high end slow dps makes it better for a pally who is most definitely going to melee dps with this. My guild gives equal chances for this weapon to either pally or druid but our druids have enough sense to pass to pallys for the purpose of melee until we all have one then it goes to druids. As for enchantz for it, it depends on where you primarily intend to use it. I would say for a paladin 22int for mostly PvE and crusader for PvP. Its going to do awesome crits with Seal of Command and a Crusader enchant.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this is a best for druid but if al ur druids have/dont want it can go to pallys and shammys</div>
