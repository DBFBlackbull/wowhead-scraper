<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got middle today after about 30 minutes of grinding. came before the lower fragment, after the upper. came from a 44 dockworker.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After 5 hours of killing the pirates, I finally found the middle map fragment.&nbsp; Earned more than 10g , lots of green items, and tons of mageweave.&nbsp; Found many top and bottom map fragments during the five hours.&nbsp; Found the Middle Map Fragment after reading that someone found it on a dock worker.&nbsp; Started killing dock workers and at about the 10th, I found the middle map fragment.&nbsp; Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got the upper and middle portion of the map in less than five minutes. also in the junkbox that had the middle portion i got the captains key for the chest and got some nice bracers for my alt. im sorry that you guys have had some problems getting these. all i am waiting for is the third one and since i got the first two i haven't been back but i'm looking forward to the quest finale! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took three hours to get the Middle Map Fragment.&nbsp; While farming pirates for this I picked up:<br /><br />2 Upper Map Fragments<br />3 EXTRA Lower Map Fragments<br />3 EXTRA Shipping Schedules<br />The Captain's Key (woot)<br />and more than half a level of XP (starting just over 45.5 and ending half a bubble past 46).<br /><br />Not my favorite grind, although I was rather happy / surprised to see the key drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>in my experience with the middle map fragments, sometimes you don't get one for hundreds of mobs.&nbsp; another time i got 2 in about 25 mob kills.&nbsp; I have done cuergo's map quest about 6 times so far.&nbsp; some times cuergo's chest has 2 green items or 1 green and 1 blue. I've gotten wirt's third leg at least twice in the chest. I've been gathering more maps and have 8 in my inventory now. I'll report what's inside the 8 chests soon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here's the math using the numbers on thottbot at the moment:&nbsp; 3.3% of pirates drop a footlocker, so it takes 1/.033 = 30 kills to get a footlocker.&nbsp; 8.9% of footlockers contain a middle map fragment so there's one in every 1/.089 = 11.2 footlockers.&nbsp; So, if you want to go &quot;farm&quot; for a middle map fragment (and I got one doing exactly this) you can go expect to kill 1/.033/.089 = 340.5 pirates.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Level 54 Night Elf Hunter, from the EU server Nordrassil.<br /><br />I decided to add this comment, after spending about sixteen (16) hours of gameplay, farming the Pirates to obtain the Middle Map Fragment.<br /><br />Now, each Pirate killed (Dockworker, Pirate, Swashbuckler, etc.) grants the player who killed them +5 reputation with Gadgetzan, and +2 reputation with all other Steamwheedle Cartel cities (i.e. Booty Bay, Everlook, Rachet).<br /><br />When I started killing Pirates to obtain the Middle Map Fragment, my reputation with Gadgetzan was Neutral, 2724/3000, yellow colour. When the Middle Map Fragment finally dropped, my reputation with Gadgetzan was 2801/6000, Friendly, green colour.<br /><br />Because I was only killing Pirates throughout this time doing no other quests which could have possibly affected my reputation with Gadgetzan in any way, it is possible to calculate exactly how many Pirates did I kill, before the Middle Map Fragment finally dropped.<br /><br />With the above in mind after doing the calculation, the result is that I had to kill six-hundred and fifteen (615) Pirate NPC's before the Middle Map Fragment dropped.<br /><br />(3000-2724+2801=3077/5=615.4)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just found the middle map fragment in the AH for 20 gold after I'd killed probably over 1000 pirates in many different sessions and never got one at all.&nbsp; I thought for a moment the world had come to an end . . .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think this rare thing about this piece is a joke. I just got 4 of them out of footlockers. I got Wirt's Third Leg twice and some other useless crap that I disenchanted. I am not making this up. Either WoW increased the drop rate or I just got really lucky. I'm a lvl 57 warlock on Malfurion and my name is Hadian on the horde side of anyone has been dying for one of these. Oh and by the way, you don't have to kill three hundred and something pirates. I only killed less than 75 and I got all that. If you don't believe me look for yourself. You can see two of them in my bags already while I found the third and one of my Wirt's legs. I found a fourth not even 15 mins later. The proof is here.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey folks,<br /><br />I think they upped the drop rate on this fragment. I am swimming in them now. Anyone else seeing same? I am finding less of the Uppers tho... odd.<br /><br />Ciao,<br />Scalptaker, Uther</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since nobody stated it in plain english..<br /><br />To do the quest.. once you have all 3 map parts joined.. and you want the key.. <br /><br />Travel to the southern-most beach in Tanaris.. Lands End Beach. 54, 92 roughly.<br /><br />Unless there's a path i don't know about you'll have to follow the eastern edge of land along and into the water.. very little actual swimming though.<br /><br />Randomly spawning on this beach is an &quot;Inconspicuous Landmark&quot; which looks like a wooden post. Click on it, 5 pirates spawn. The 1st kill &quot;should&quot; have the key so loot it quick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just happened to get the Lower Map Fragment earlier today and I saw that the drop rate was 0.1% so I thought that I would never get the other two pieces. I logged for a while and killed two pirates and got two footlockers and the other two pieces were in the footlockers needless to say I was surprised.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got mine by picking their pockets</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>GRRRRR! If Allakhazam had just been a LITTLE more clear on how to get this fragment, I could have saved myself 10 hours of trying to get it! I got the upper and lower fragments within 2 hours of grinding. I then spent 10 hours trying to recieve the middle one and I didn't find it. At least I got honored to Gadgetzan out of the deal.<br /><br />Then, as chance had it, while I fought to the chest in the boat (to use the captain's key) a footlocker dropped that had the fragment!<br /><br />So, as it turns out, Allakhazam is right (just unclear about it). The middle map fragments DO only drop off Southsea Swashbucklers. That confused me and I discounted it when I read it here because the fragments only come from pirates footlockers which can drop from any pirate.<br /><br />Nope, not true. They do drop from any pirate but the type of pirate influences what you can loot from that footlocker. The middle map fragment can only be looted from a Pirate's footlocker that drops from a Southsea Swashbuckler!<br /><br />Learn this and save yourself 10 hours of mindnumbing boredom!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I spent 2 days looking for this drop. I gained half of level 45 and all of level 44 looking for it. I collected prolly 12 of the other map pieces, and a couple of ship schedules. I NEVER FOUND THE MIDDLE MAP. I ended up seeing the complete treasure map for 5G and just ended up buying it. I got a dinky lvl 39 shield from the box, and a little silver. completly useless. However, I found &quot;wirts third leg&quot; in one of the footlockers, so that was a plus, and I took care of all of my donations of mageweave, because it drops so much. Good luck, because I didn't have any.</div>

I would encourage anyone who finds themselves lucky enough to have an extra Middle Map Fragment to save it for a friend or sell it in AH as I saw one there with a high price tag on it and I'm guessing this is because it might be hard for others to find as well. <br /><br />Edited, Wed Dec 7 20:50:47 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i just got one from a &quot;Pirate's Footlocker&quot;<br />1st iv'e seen drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just finished reading these posts and sure enough the next swashbuckler killed dropped the footlocker with the middle piece in it. Only took about an hour of grinding. Maybe the drops are getting better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>rarely drops so gl. you need all three pieces of map: upper, lower, and middle to start quest<br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 15th 2006 at 4:36pm PDT by ignites</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After 13 hours trying to get it 1 day, it finally dropped the 2nd day after about 2-3 hours.<br /><br />I got it off a Swashbuckler down by the docks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does ANYONE have any tips for this? I've killed a TON (huuuuundreds) of pirates trying to get the MIDDLE MAP FRAGMENT to drop, but it's just not dropping! I'm starting to get paranoid that there's a level cap on the drop/quest or something because I'm seeing Pirate Footlockers alot less than I used to...<br /><br />ANY TIPS? ANYONE? I'm DESPERATE!<br /><br />Hoof/Whisperwind</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>any1 have the middle fragment i can buy? (europe, Shadowsong, Horde</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ClasscMalcontent</b></h3>WoW Classic 1.13.2 the same old vanilla bug is still present. There is a chance that either no chest will spawn or it may despawn before you can even loot it. Recommend avoiding this quest. Try selling the fragments on the neutral AH in Gadgetzan and perhaps they will sell. Or just destroy or vendor them. The overall time to travel to the area is not worth the likely chance of encountering the bug. For reference: It bugged on me and was a colossal waste of time.If you have the key and decide to try it best of luck to you!</div>
