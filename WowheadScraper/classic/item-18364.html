<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest can be done at 54 with the assistance from a person with the cresent key. I just baught the book on Spinebreaker and did it with a friend. You really dont need more then a Lesser Invisibility potion (But you can use a Invisibility potion if you would like to be safer). Since its such a short distance from the start of the instance past the first mob you only need one potion. <b>(Since this is the Druid book just go ahead and stealth in catform :D)</b><br /><br />The thing you need to look out for is the Dog Patrol, they spot you very easy because of there high stealth detection, I had to die once to learn to watch closer. <br /><br />When you go down the ramp to the left at the very beginning of the instance, try not to get to close to the mob at the bottom, jump off the side to get a little distance and then hug the corner of the next ramp down to the library door. Once you get into the library door you're in the clear. Enjoy you new Trinket when you finish that long run down the hall!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You can farm books of Guard Mul'Dar easily by killing him then resetting the instance. There is only 1 other mob you need to kill before him so it essentailly is well under 5 minutes for a drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><a href="/classic/item=18470/royal-seal-of-eldrethalas">Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas</a> Seal of Eldre'Thalas <br />Binds when picked up <br />Unique <br />Trinket Miscellaneous <br />+10 Fire Resistance <br />Classes: Druid <br />Passive: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 44. <br />&quot;Blessed by the Shen'dralar Ancients.&quot; <br /><br />comes up with the priest trinket when you follow the quest thru Alla - bug needs fixing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>to correct an earlier post, the large seaforuim charge won't work, you have to use the powerful seaforium charge. the rest was right though take two, go straight then left and you're homefree.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was a little depressed when I was outbid last week on the book @ 150g, but got it today at AH for 60g. So it seems everything works out for the best... lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just sold it for a 75g bid in /2 in Org.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I bought the book for under 20g on Kargath. 20g seems to be the going rate there.<br /><br />If you're a druid, the quest is quite easy. You need to enter through the Dire Maul North entrance. You will need a way to open the 2 sets of doors: the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18249">Crescent Key</a>, a rogue with 295 lockpicking, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4398">Large Seaforium Charge</a> x2, or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15872">Arcanite Skeleton Key</a> x2.<br /><br />Unlock the doors to the instance entrance with one of the means mentioned above. Stealth straight ahead down into the pit. Avoid the dogs completely. They will see through stealth. Turn left and go to the door there. Open the door (this is the second locked door) and you're free and clear. No more need for stealth. The passage takes you to the library. Find the person you need to talk to to complete the quest, then you're done. Just don't talk to the Prince.<br /><br />That's all! Happy questing!<br /><br />Edited, Mon Jan 9 18:02:26 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>eh thats pretty cool , i will prob use it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just got my Book for 4g got the guy to send it to me C.O.D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I bought this for 50 silver on Thunderhorn, the books for all of the classes are averaging 2 gold lately, no one knows why.</div>
