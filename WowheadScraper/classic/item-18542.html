(I have assumed every swing because if I didnt Im sure some warriors would argue they could do a skill every swing, and although maybe it wont be mortal every time the principle is the same).\n\nSo that makes [u]204+416=630[\/u] damage a swing.\n\nTimes that over, say, a 5 minuite period:\n\n79(swings)x630= \n\n[b]49770[\/b] damage done total\n\n[b]Typhoon:[\/b]\n\ndamage between 150-225=187 median damage every 2.8 seconds\n\n187+160(mortal strike)= 347\n\n187+347=534 done every 2.8 seconds over 5 mins=\n\n107(swings)x534=\n\n[b]57138[\/b] total damage\n\n\nArchinite Reaper = 49770\nTyphoon          = 57138\n\nSo, in other words, over a set period of time typoon completely outdistances the reaper in terms of damage, making it a better melee weapon.\n\nOn a side note, and for those that will read this and then say something in terms of 'but that means nothing because you could kill a player\/normal mob in a few swings'. Yes a normal mob or a cloth wearer you could kill in relativley few swings, but not any elite, any boss, any mail\/plate wearer. \n\nConclusion: The Typhoon does more damage than the archinite reaper to anything that takes over 1 minuite to kill (a seporate equation would have to be done for this as thats a guess).\n\n\n[b]Part 3[\/b]- the stats:\n\nThis is mainly aimed at SynergyXL who did a terrible job of compairing stats between the 2 ( you dont compare 5% crit from a talent to 20agi, you compare it to the equivelent sword talent).\n\nLets have a look at the two stat sets:\n\nArcanite Reaper\n+13 sta\n+62 attack power\n\nTyphoon \n14 str\n20 agi\n10 sta\n1% dodge\n\nThe stam differenice is obvious: 30 more hp from the reaper.\n\nWhich leaves the reapers 62 extra power against Typhoons 3 other stats.\n\nReaper\n62 attack power = 4.4 extra dps\n\nTyphoon\n14 str = 2 extra dps\n20 agi = 1% extra dodge\/crit chance\/20 extra ac\n1% extra dodge\n\nSSo in exchange for 2.4dps you are getting 2%dodge chance\/1%crit chance and 20 extra armour.   I know whcih I would choose.\n\nComparing sword proc to extra axe crit from talents is another matter, this debate is between the quality of the weapons, not the talent tree.\n\n\n[b]Part 4[\/b]- Conclusion\n\nPretty simple really, the Typoon does more damage the longer you use it, it has better stats and the only place to use the reaper is if you only intend hitting something a few times, and even then, you miss out on the better stats.\n\n\nP.S\nThe Typhoon is one of the best melee weapons in the game, and in my opinion should be given to the most specifically melee class in the game, which is a warrior since they will use it much more often than a hunter, its that simple. Im not denying its a good sword for a hunter, its a freaking great sword for a hunter, but as has been said there are better (and easier to get) for hunters, there  arent for warriors.\n\nP.P.S\n\nTo the people hurling insults around, you will notice at no point did I call anyone a noob, idiot, clueless, fool or any such term for having an opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdited, Thu Apr 21 08:08:44 2005","date":"2005-04-21T12:04:49-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"You make valid points, but let me just interject one thing:\n\nNo PvP fight or really any normal mob outside of instances is going to be working with 50k hitpoints.\n\nWell...that and a warrior can't do a skill every 2.8 seconds.\n\nYes vs raid bosses this is good for warriors and paladins.

When a guild does something, the looting rules are set up to benefit the entire guild.  Can a hunter use it?  Of course; it's a 2hand sword, and hunters can use 2hand weapons.  Is it going to be 90% just for show on a hunter & will be put to good use on a war or a pally?  You bet.  Just like my pally is never going to want, ask to be considered for a drop, roll on , etc cloth.  Wow a cloth <slot name> with 30 int on it.. hell my pally needs mana & I can wear cloth too!  Why shouldn't I be able to?  Because there are much more effective pieces for me, and it will benefit a priest, mage, or warlock MUCH more than it would benefit me.. and thus benefit the entire guild.  Would any decent guild out there actually prefer their hunter to walk around with one just to brag & show it off in IF, or would they want the war or pally to use it.

Or if a pally or warrior wanted to get that set piece, or an epic chain chest piece?  Hell they will never use it, but you know, they can use chain too so why not, eh?\n\nI'm not saying that NO hunter should EVER get it.. but they should be at the end of the line, after any war or pally that wanted it has gotten it.  If you're trying to get in on items that will be of GREAT use to some classes and little to none to you, but you would rather you get it instead of somebody that's actually going to use it, just so you can show it off (and you know good and well that's why a hunter wants this, if you're saying otherwise, you're a liar, sorry but it's true), than you're just plain greedy, and if you have a guild full of greedy people, you're not going anywhere int he game, sorry to disapoint you.

This sword has better DPS then blade of hanna and as a Ret paladin you want the dps to hold aggro if there is no warrior to tank so this sword would be better for a paladin.","date":"2005-04-23T02:47:32-05:00","rating":-10,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Gutss","importedSubject":"Great sword"},{"commentv2":1,"number":63,"id":3066728,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"This is for the last of those of my kind that exist... the two handed fury build.

Cause you could use it better?  In an end-game guild, I can see that being an issue, but that's taking into account you're in an endgame guild and on a guild only raid.\n\n  But what if I'm not in your guild (or any guild for that matter)?  What if I could care less if your warrior needs this for MC?  Warriors\/Pallys get free range on any melee weapon and Hunters get first shot on ranged weapons?  Gee, that sounds great.  Let's see, there are, um... 30-40 melee weapons available for endgame War\/Pals and there are... oh, 8 ranged weapons?  One of which comes off a quest!\n\n  You want to keep the hunters quiet?  Why don't you stingy, greedy f'ers help your hunters get their next best bows without whining about \"there's nothing in it for me\" and then turn around in instances where we do a ton of damage for you knowing that all we're gonna get out of it is a 8% chance of catching a piece of Beaststalker?\n\n  If the weapon had no bonuses, I could care less.

How's that any different than being a ninja-looting scumbag?\n\n  If you say at the beginning of the raid \"hunters will not be allowed to roll on Typhoon\", you can skip all the complaining.

Bless him.\n\nOn top of the fact thats its been proved below that typhoon scores more damage in a 5min fight using sword proc over the arc reaper and axe proc there are a few other concerns to note when using sword over axe talent.\n\nFor instance, what many people (including synergy Im assuming since this wasnt within his marvelous maths; he didnt add in the chance for an extra attack to the MS strikes) is that the 6% chance for an additional attack doesnt ONLY apply to regular attacks, it can also proc from an MS\/whirlwind\/overpower. Basically any melee attack can cause the sword proc to activate, including the sword proc itself, although this is extrodanarily rare.\n\nSo in other words, if this had been factored in the 5 min battle, the typhoon would have beaten the arc. reaper by an even larger margin.\n\n5% extra crit from the axe specialiation is great, and a fabulous option for an warrior, but the sword specialisation is at least the equal of it when you factor in its ability to proc off pretty much anything.  \n\nThat said, if u are including impale in your build the extra crit chance would pay off more for the 20% addition damage per crit, but not everyone uses impale, and not everyone uses the exact same talent build either.","date":"2005-05-01T10:33:59-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Sadarak","importedSubject":"Something about the sword proc"},{"commentv2":1,"number":101,"id":3066766,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I am a level 60 hunter, second Alliance hunter to hit 60 on my server. Today I got this sword.\n\nI didn't roll for it. Our guild uses a point system, and I was actually near the bottom of the points list. The point is that pretty much all the warriors\/paladins passed on it. The difference is that we have a \"no idiots\" policy in our guild, and many of the warriors and paladins realize that there are better weapons out there for them.\n\nAnyone that says that Arcanite Reaper is a better weapon for a warrior is partially right. Reaper is better burst damage and better for pvp - typhoon is better sustained damage and for long battles. \n\nAnyone who says that hunters should be using greens \"of agility\" or \"of the monkey\" is just a complete !@#$ing moron. Maybe if we didn't have an 8 yard minimum range we wouldn't care about having good melee weapons. \n\nNow I'm not saying this is a bad weapon for a warrior, it's definitely a good one. It's also a good weapon for a paladin.\n\nThe kicker is that this is the BEST two handed melee weapon for a hunter. Period. There are no better ones in the game. \n\nFor a warrior? Obsidian Edged Blade BLOWS this away. Equal dps, much higher max damage, and +42 strength. Bonereaver's Edge (although a bit harder to get) is also way, way better. \n\nFor a paladin? Earthshaker is a much better pvp weapon, knockdown = nobody running away. Finkle's Lava Dredger is a GODLY paladin weapon.\n\nSo while this is not the best weapon for a warrior\/paladin, it is by far the best weapon for a hunter. That's why I currently, as a hunter, wield the only Typhoon to ever drop on the Alliance side on my server (horde usually have a stranglehold on Azuregos). \n\nThere are no better 2h melee weapons in the game for me, this is it. I'll never need another melee weapon again. If a warrior were wielding this, he'd cry when Obsidian Edged Blade dropped. \n\nAnd for the guy who said this: \"ok hunters, well good ones that would actually kill a boss like this, know this isn't for them\"\n\nAny guild that is killing a boss of this magnitude knows that this weapon is for hunters, and that there are far better warrior\/paladin weapons in the game.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Unless some of you haven't noticed, since you've been squabbling about what class should use this, this sword drops from Azuregos.<br /><br />This means that you only have a fractionally small chance of getting it, unless your guild is one of the best 3 on your server, in which case you still need to find and kill Azuregos before anyone else does. And even if you do by some great fortune manage to kill Azuregos you still have less than a 1 in 5 chance of it dropping, and irrelevant of class you will probably find 5-10 people who will roll on this.<br /><br />Face the facts, this weapon is too much hassle to get when there are better weapons for all classes out there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>hunters, brothers and sisters alike. Yes. this sword is epic. yes it has 20 agility. YES. we can use it. NO. NO, we should not role on it. Prehaps in the rare situation that nobody cares if you role, then go ahead. but 20 agil + 1% to parry is not worth it. yes, we do occasionally have to melee, and yes having a powerful weapon helps us survive. but there are better weapons out there. I am currently using Stoneraven. cost 30g, 13agil, 15stam, 13 strength, 9 spirit. I would love to have this weapon, but not when i know in my heart or hearts that someone(warrior) can use it better. plus, our agil to crit is 50:1. a warriors is 20:1 (yea we are gimped) not to comform or anything, but we ARE RANGED.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol enough with the hunter should or should not roll thingy...<br />basically as i hunter myself i dont really like to roll on stuffs with proc.. even they look rather nice haha... but i think i would go for stuffs with stats... like this and the babarious blade.. i wouldnt mind if a melee roll on em as its still a melee weapon n if they need go ahead n roll... if i win im happy if i lost the roll fine its my luck gz to the winner ^^<br /><br />anyway the only thing screwed up will be when a player who can use 2H sword roll on it rite?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Albrecht I'm not going to flame you or anything I'm simply going to correct you. You said that hunters at most melee 5% of the time, as much as I wish that that is true, it isn't. I've found it to be more like melee 30%-40% of the time and range 60%-70% of the time. In instances hunters rarely melee but when they solo and pvp they have to deal with melee most of the time. However I would not roll on this weapon because my hunter is built for high crits so I am either going to use 2x dawn's edge, babarous blade, or something else that comes out.<br /><br />I just really want to make it clear to these people that fight over which class should get what weapon and say to them that they sound like selvish brats. Yes I would be mad if a warrior or rogue rolled on an epic bow/gun/crossbow just for 5-10 stamina and that they probably did it out of spite, but I wouldn't flame all over thottbot, wow forums, alla etc.. I say that if it benefits you in a significant way you should be allowed to roll on it. If an epic gun comes out that gives like 20 to str and sta I would let a tank roll on it without being mad. Also stop referring to the general populace of a class when a few stengy bastards did something that you didn't like.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I wouldn't use this for my Warrior if you paid me.<br /><br />Seems to be nice for Hunters though, and takes me back to my FFXI days when Samuarai's carried swords just like this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This would be the perfect weapon for a Survival specced hunter, if such a person exists. Otherwise, Barbarous Blade is much better.<br /><br />Have no idea how this stacks up as a warrior weapon, but based on it's DPS and stats, it looks good to me.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Why isn't this a hunter weapon? We use the agility, the stamina, and the damage would be great for PvP. Also, in instances, there are small areas. We are forced to melee. In PvP, we are forced to melee. We melee far more than a warrior goes ranged. The parry is useless to hunters? Read counterattack please. Some builds require as much parry chance as possible. This is definately a hunter weapon, as long as they're specialized correctly. Any survival hunter should pick this up on the spot. Anything else, and it's questionable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It seems to me that almost every high end weapon has a long stream of vitriol below it from people bashing on about how one class deserves the item above another, granted some of the points are valid but it strikes me that in an anctual raid the rolling with go with the consensus of that particular raid anyway, and anyone that goes against it will likley be the target of such agrovation as to not make it worth while.<br /><br />But in the sense of this largley academic argument, my 2 pence worth(and something I hope will adress all the issues so far):<br /><br /><b>Part 1</b> - the words.<br /><br />The main argument here against warriors using this sword:'It doesnt have as high max damage as the archinite reaper.'<br /><br />True, it has about 20 less max damage, which in turn effects some skills of the warrior (SOME), so when u mortal strike to get about 20 more damage, just like heroic and whirlwind.<br /><br />So if u look at it simply, you get 21 extra damage from skils with the archinite reaper, but what many dont seem to take into acount is even when using skills u are still plugging away with your normal melee strike, and causing 10.9 more dps with this than the archinite reaper. <br /><br />Think about that, u get 20 more damage when u manage to use a skill and u get 10.9 more damage PER SECOND.<br /><br />For those that will still argue with this lets do a few sums done in a one on one battle:<br /><br /><b>Part 2</b> - the sums:<br /><br /><b>Archinite Reaper:</b><br /><br />damage between <u>153-256 = 204</u> median damage every 3.8 seconds<br /><br />Now lets assume you can get a skill off every swing to make the math easier to understand, lets make it mortal strike, that means that every swing the archinite reaper is inflicting <u>256+160=416</u> for each mortal strike. (I have assumed every swing because if I didnt Im sure some warriors would argue they could do a skill every swing, and although maybe it wont be mortal every time the principle is the same).<br /><br />So that makes <u>204+416=630</u> damage a swing.<br /><br />Times that over, say, a 5 minuite period:<br /><br />79(swings)x630= <br /><br /><b>49770</b> damage done total<br /><br /><b>Typhoon:</b><br /><br />damage between 150-225=187 median damage every 2.8 seconds<br /><br />187+160(mortal strike)= 347<br /><br />187+347=534 done every 2.8 seconds over 5 mins=<br /><br />107(swings)x534=<br /><br /><b>57138</b> total damage<br /><br />Archinite Reaper = 49770<br />Typhoon = 57138<br /><br />So, in other words, over a set period of time typoon completely outdistances the reaper in terms of damage, making it a better melee weapon.<br /><br />On a side note, and for those that will read this and then say something in terms of 'but that means nothing because you could kill a player/normal mob in a few swings'. Yes a normal mob or a cloth wearer you could kill in relativley few swings, but not any elite, any boss, any mail/plate wearer. <br /><br />Conclusion: The Typhoon does more damage than the archinite reaper to anything that takes over 1 minuite to kill (a seporate equation would have to be done for this as thats a guess).<br /><br /><b>Part 3</b>- the stats:<br /><br />This is mainly aimed at SynergyXL who did a terrible job of compairing stats between the 2 ( you dont compare 5% crit from a talent to 20agi, you compare it to the equivelent sword talent).<br /><br />Lets have a look at the two stat sets:<br /><br />Arcanite Reaper<br />+13 sta<br />+62 attack power<br /><br />Typhoon <br />14 str<br />20 agi<br />10 sta<br />1% dodge<br /><br />The stam differenice is obvious: 30 more hp from the reaper.<br /><br />Which leaves the reapers 62 extra power against Typhoons 3 other stats.<br /><br />Reaper<br />62 attack power = 4.4 extra dps<br /><br />Typhoon<br />14 str = 2 extra dps<br />20 agi = 1% extra dodge/crit chance/20 extra ac<br />1% extra dodge<br /><br />SSo in exchange for 2.4dps you are getting 2%dodge chance/1%crit chance and 20 extra armour. I know whcih I would choose.<br /><br />Comparing sword proc to extra axe crit from talents is another matter, this debate is between the quality of the weapons, not the talent tree.<br /><br /><b>Part 4</b>- Conclusion<br /><br />Pretty simple really, the Typoon does more damage the longer you use it, it has better stats and the only place to use the reaper is if you only intend hitting something a few times, and even then, you miss out on the better stats.<br /><br />P.S<br />The Typhoon is one of the best melee weapons in the game, and in my opinion should be given to the most specifically melee class in the game, which is a warrior since they will use it much more often than a hunter, its that simple. Im not denying its a good sword for a hunter, its a freaking great sword for a hunter, but as has been said there are better (and easier to get) for hunters, there arent for warriors.<br /><br />P.P.S<br /><br />To the people hurling insults around, you will notice at no point did I call anyone a noob, idiot, clueless, fool or any such term for having an opinion.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Apr 21 08:08:44 2005</div>

I dont care if a warrior wants it, i will roll and take it and wear it, and there is not much u can do about it except cry over my winning and u losing :) Get over it you crying babies, just a game, no sence in crapping your diapers because u didnt get a sword.

If you let a Hunter stay 8 yards away from you at all times in PvP you are; <br /> A)Another Hunter<br /> B)Retarded<br /><br /> I can understand how all you crybaby warriors on carebear servers might have missed this fact, because you were too busy cleaning sand out of your vagina to think about anyone but yourselves.<br /><br /> &quot;Wah fine then I'm rolling on an epic bow!&quot; Why don't you pull your tiny head out and realize that's a completely different ballpark. We outshine you exponentially in ranged combat. That would be like a Hunter rolling on a cloth +healing item for his 1 single pet heal. We have talents, abilities, and pvp requirements for melee. You have &quot;ranged attack&quot; and the need to be a spiteful asshat. Yes your melee better than ours. But we're much closer to your lvl of melee than you are to our lvl or ranged power. The fact of the matter is this is just as useful for a soloing/pvp hunter as it is for an instance running warrior/paladin. And Hunters spend a lot more time out grinding and engaging in pvp than anyone spends in an instance anyway.<br /><br />Face the facts. On a PvP server, this is a fabulous weapon for hunters as well. Yeah, in instances, this thing will sit on my back and do nothing but give me more of that sweet sweet agility. But the Other 90 PERCENT OF THE TIME I'M PLAYING it would be a very valuable weapon. Johnson and Johnson makes a great product for the warriors in this thread. No More Tears BABY shampoo.

Thus my noobish friends, higher dmg weapons mean higher dmg output! Congratz you have learnt something new. I, as a warrior, would pass this to a hunter as it is more usefull for them, because yes they need the stats more. Any warrior that says otherwise is a retard and u should reroll. Any warrior that bases an item on its DPS is a retard and should reroll.. Smart warriors look at dmg, not dps..

Seriously.. A hunter uses his melee 15% of the time, and when it comes to endgame, i'd laugh at a hunter trying to go melee in a raid. And then have him kicked.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>That's why pickup raids suck :) If you're in a decent end-game guild, a hunter won't get this, unless no war or pally want it. When a guild does something, the looting rules are set up to benefit the entire guild. Can a hunter use it? Of course; it's a 2hand sword, and hunters can use 2hand weapons. Is it going to be 90% just for show on a hunter &amp; will be put to good use on a war or a pally? You bet. Just like my pally is never going to want, ask to be considered for a drop, roll on , etc cloth. Wow a cloth &lt;slot name&gt; with 30 int on it.. hell my pally needs mana &amp; I can wear cloth too! Why shouldn't I be able to? Because there are much more effective pieces for me, and it will benefit a priest, mage, or warlock MUCH more than it would benefit me.. and thus benefit the entire guild. Would any decent guild out there actually prefer their hunter to walk around with one just to brag &amp; show it off in IF, or would they want the war or pally to use it. So yeah, if a hunter in your guild gets this, don't feel too bad ;) if the loot distrobution is such that loot is going to people that will hardly ever use it, and keeping it out of the hands where it's goign to do <i>everbody</i> in the guild some good, I doubt you'll be getting any of the good stuff from MC &amp; such anytime soon lol.<br /><br />To make one final point, that somebody mentioned earlier.. look at it this way, hunters(and yes I have a hunter also, and I wouldn't do anything retarded like try to keep a weapon like this from another war or pally, unless everybody already had one that wanted it) : How would <b>you</b> feel if a warrior or rogue wanted to get an awesome epic bow, that puts the hand cannon to shame? Or if a pally or warrior wanted to get that set piece, or an epic chain chest piece? Hell they will never use it, but you know, they can use chain too so why not, eh?<br /><br />I'm not saying that NO hunter should EVER get it.. but they should be at the end of the line, after any war or pally that wanted it has gotten it. If you're trying to get in on items that will be of GREAT use to some classes and little to none to you, but you would rather you get it instead of somebody that's actually going to use it, just so you can show it off (and you know good and well that's why a hunter wants this, if you're saying otherwise, you're a liar, sorry but it's true), than you're just plain greedy, and if you have a guild full of greedy people, you're not going anywhere int he game, sorry to disapoint you. But hell, you can always look up on various message boards and see what the successful guilds are up to, right?<br /><br />edit: had to update sig =D<br /><br />Edited, Fri Apr 1 18:56:58 2005</div>

These are all stats a warrior could use, even though we have absolutely no use for the rest of the item. If i see a hunter with a typhoon, you bet i'll be one proud warrior to make things even.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This sword is great I my self would roll on this I am a 60 paladin. I read alot of these posts about hunters should roll and warriors shouldnt. I would like to see a MS warrior or a Ret paladin get this over a hunter. Not cuz I hate hunters cuz I dont I play a hunter also a level 40 hunter. I think Paladins or Warriors should get this over hunters cuz most hunters want AGI yes this has 20 agi not bad but a hunter rolls on every weapon that has agi. I think hunter should give this weapon to a paladin or warrior who will use it and not get it just for the stats so they can sit back and look cool. I dont mind a hunter getting this if no one needs it but it should go to a paladin or warrior I think cuz you dont see a hunter up there in melee attack tanking a mob you see there pet or a warrior or paladin tanking for them.<br /><br />Also I saw someone said that blade of hanna is better for a paladin witch is wrong. This sword has better DPS then blade of hanna and as a Ret paladin you want the dps to hold aggro if there is no warrior to tank so this sword would be better for a paladin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>While I have to agree with both sides of this arguement, there's a bigger picture to look at. Sure, this would be more advantageous in the hands of a Warrior/Pally in MC, but how often does everyone go to MC? There are a lot of loot &quot;rules&quot; that no one really abides by because of these &quot;I can use it better&quot; lines that are just horse poo. +20 agility? Why wouldn't a hunter want that? Cause you could use it better? In an end-game guild, I can see that being an issue, but that's taking into account you're in an endgame guild and on a guild only raid.<br /><br /> But what if I'm not in your guild (or any guild for that matter)? What if I could care less if your warrior needs this for MC? Warriors/Pallys get free range on any melee weapon and Hunters get first shot on ranged weapons? Gee, that sounds great. Let's see, there are, um... 30-40 melee weapons available for endgame War/Pals and there are... oh, 8 ranged weapons? One of which comes off a quest!<br /><br /> You want to keep the hunters quiet? Why don't you stingy, greedy f'ers help your hunters get their next best bows without whining about &quot;there's nothing in it for me&quot; and then turn around in instances where we do a ton of damage for you knowing that all we're gonna get out of it is a 8% chance of catching a piece of Beaststalker?<br /><br /> If the weapon had no bonuses, I could care less. Hunters who roll on Doomsaw should be taken out and shot. But while we're not melee's when there are tanks around, don't drop this &quot;Hunters don't melee&quot; s--t around the yard. I'm not wearing hip boots. Especially since our pet aggro's got nerfed with this patch.<br /><br /> We helped kill it, and if we're not in your guild, you better damn well believe we have the right to roll on it. If you run a pick-up and are rolling on the drop, then when this drops and the non-guild Hunter wants to roll and you say no with your narrow minded understanding of what hunters deal with outside of instance raids, you're pretty much saying &quot;f you, it's mine&quot;. How's that any different than being a ninja-looting scumbag?<br /><br /> If you say at the beginning of the raid &quot;hunters will not be allowed to roll on Typhoon&quot;, you can skip all the complaining. More than likely the hunters will just leave with some rude parting gestures. If they stay, they've got no right to complain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>hi im lvl 60 hunter <br /><br />imo this is a +crit warr weapon and not a hunter weapon every hunter who goes 2h should go for Barberous Blade or peacemaker...<br /><br />Barberous Blade gives you ~50 atack power = ~25 agility and 1% crit..... the 1% crit of Barberous Blade is better than 14 str, 10 stm and ~15dps more meele...<br /><br />every hunter should go for crit gear cause a hunter need ~60 agi for 1% crit<br /><br />on the other side a warrior need about ~18 agi for 1% crit so this is a warrior weapon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't really see this as a good Hunter weapon currently.<br /><br />Maybe when they finally do the mythical &quot;Hunter love patch&quot; and revamp the survival tree into something worth taking, it'd be good, but currently hunters need +crit simply because our crit/agi is so low. A warrior or a paladin will get +1% crit from this, a hunter will only get .4%. Of course, this isn't that good for Arms warriors or Retrib pallies, so right now the only people I could see really wanting it are the odd 2h Fury warrior and non-retri Pallies.<br /><br />However, if Counterattack ever gets buffed so it does 100% damage instead of flat damage, I'm going after this in a heartbeat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A wise man once gave me wise advise....don't suck. It's ever so simple. Don't suck. Just don't. Survival hunters suck....marksman hunters a practical and therefore naturally rule. Warriors who deck out themselves with agi gear assuming that the dodge bonus will help them and the crit bonus will help them suck royally and are very VERY stupid. Warriors who focus on stamina and strength which will drastically increase their raw dps and chance to hit along with hp are intelligent and therefore rule. Typhoon is a 20 agi and yes, 17 strength weapon. The strength and parry are good for warriors. While the 20 agi vs. 17 strength and the parry which helps really any non caster clearly helps hunters as well. Either way this works out. The agility helps a hunter's ranged dps and is a prime stat for them thus drastically increases their crit, dodge, and chance to hit. While the strength does the same thing for warriors and for those who are doing pvp it's ever so good. So people, don't suck and good things will happen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes hunters would use the +20 Agi very well, but wont have ANY use for the rest. The stamina MAYBE, but come on. Without warriors there, agi would be useless. You would be owned in an instant. Warriors have a MUCH greater need for this than Hunters.They actually use all the stats and proc. increased parry, stamina=HP, strength=dmg, and agility=armour+crit which Warriors need much more than hunters. Although the Hunter would benefit greatly from it, it might as well be Warrior only. Pally, maybe, less need than hunter, but still. Warrior should have no competition from Hunters when rolling for this weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What I would like to know is how everyone knows so much about hunters. I would use this weapon a lot as a hunter. People tell me it's stupid for hunters to go melee, and well it's unavoidable. There is no reason for a hunter to even go on this raid because this is the only item that drops that we can use. It's like saying its stupid for rogues to get maces or swords because they can do so much more damage with daggers. And as far as PvP I have to go melee more then ranged. In any PvP fight people always take ranged combat away from hunters because they can be so deadly. Too bad I can kick just as much ass ranged as I do melee. I think people need to stop giving hunters such a hard time about this weapon. This is such a bad ass weapon especially in PvP, and I'd use it nonstop!<br /><br />I think unless you played a hunter you need to stop ragging on us. And when I mean play a hunter I mean fully play a hunter, got get to level 40 and say that you played one. I've seen my style of play change a lot since I hit 60, and believe it or not I go melee a lot more now, and die a lot less.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Mar 29 13:59:49 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is obviously more better for warriors than hunters. True it maybe good for hunters, but a warrior will certainly make more use of this than any hunter could.<br /><br /><u>Agility</u><br />For some that dont believe, Agil is an important stat for warriors. Agil could actually surpass str in usefulness for warriors. For example, a fury warrior would find agil a lot more useful than str, because fury warriors are dependant on flurry therefore they would be better with agil to increase their crit % so flurry would proc.<br /><u>Strenght</u><br />The str stat on the sword almost ensures that this is a warrior sword. Warriors melee far far more than hunters.<br /><u>Stamina</u><br />No need to say that stam is more useful to warriors than hunters.<br /><u>Parry</u><br />1% parry is yet again more useful to warriors because they melee a lot more than hunters.<br /><br />In the end, this weapon is Warrior&gt;Hunter. Warriors should have more priority on the weap than hunters.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Mar 30 05:42:31 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone who says this is a hunter weapon... goddamn. This is DEFINITELY a Paladin/Warrior weapon. You spend 80% of your time shooting your gun rather than using a weapon to bash people in melee. Would you be happy if you got outrolled on Dwarven Hand Cannon by a Warrior? Just because you can use it, doesn't mean you should. Hell, I could roll on Beaststalkers if I wanted to. <br /><br />Is this a PvP weapon? Hell yes. It does the equivalent of Blackhand Doomsaw, but is much faster, allowing Paladins to 'hopefully' prevent someone from kiting. Warriors should use it because many are heavy on crit-based builds (Paladins likewise), and this would create HEAVY damage.<br /><br />Strength: Tank Stat<br />Agility: Hunter Stat, also a Critadin and Warrior Stat<br />Stamina: Obvious Tank Stat<br /><b>Increased Parry: If you think this is even a remotely important hunter stat, you shouldn't even be in the raid to kill Azuregos.</b><br /><br />Edited, Wed Mar 30 17:26:03 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'll agree that many hunters deserve a bad rep for rolling on inappropriate weapons like Blackblade of Sharam or a Doomsaw. <br /><br />However, this is not one of those weapons. It has awesome stat boosts, which are exactly what a hunter would ideally want. The weapons that hunters need to learn to defer to warriors on are ones with only proc and no stats, for the simple reason that the warrior will proc that thing a hundred times more often. Hunter's wearing proc weapons don't look uber... they look foolish. <br /><br />Typhoon though, is great damage, but its on the fast side for a MS warrior build, Arcanite Reaver probably still wins out. With no proc and good stats its a great weapon for a Hunter or warrior... not bad for a pally, but no where near as good as BLade of Hanna is for them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Maybe you didn't see my point...<br /><br />What the &amp;*!@ is a hunter going to do with the highest dps 2h sword in game (64.7)<br /><br /> ?<br /><br />If your playing proppery you should be kiting the hell out of whatever. (and assuming you are, you should only hit them each time your gonna wing clip, blackhand doomsaw is probably even better because if the proc goes off then you have even more damage (but no agility, I know, I'm just proving a point)) <br />When BG comes out I want to see Hunters meleeing so bad... Just so everyone can finally see how bad hunters are meleeing, if you have played dota then expect BG to be like that, but way more complicated. Would some one who is ranged run up in the front and start bashing people with his awsome epic 2h? Hell %^&amp;*ing no. Wich is the same reason rogues don't sit in the back and use ranged. The only reason a hunter should want a weapon is for the stats, and there ARE better stat weapons than this.</div>

Are we just there to do tons of dmg and walk away being happy for the warrior/Paladin? This is the only thing that drops that a hunter could have a use for counting both Azuregos and Kazzak. Warriors should use 1h and shield. They are designed to tank. Start the flame..<br /><br />*To Araceil: &quot;1)Don't try to make a comeback by saying &quot;Oh but they're so rare!&quot; Guess what, Typhoon has a small chance to drop off of one mob who requires 40+ people to kill.&quot; <br /><br />The weapons you listed there has an even smaller % of dropping in Molten Core. Last time I checked Molten core was a hard raid instance.Think you need a lot of people there too.* <br /><br />*Edit: *Edit* I wouldn't roll for this thou. There is better weapons for hunters.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Guess what. <br />Not every warrior has a two hand axe warrior build. Some of us have a two hand sword build or GASP... A sword and shield build.<br />Whether the math for arcanite reaper = 1 billion dps or 1, its irrelevent for those of us who don't us axes at all. So if I'm a warrior who uses swords for whatever reason ,be it appearance, the want to not a be a cookie cutter template, or whatever the reason...I'm going to roll on it if it's better than the one I have.<br />I would roll on this in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Please dont post telling me how gimped a non 2h axe warrior is or on spelling or gramatical errors because it's irrellivent.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just a word on the Sword specialisation vs Axe specialiseation.<br /><br />First, dont listen to Synergy, he appears to have the opinion that his is the only one that matters for some reason, and anyone that differs is a fool. Bless him.<br /><br />On top of the fact thats its been proved below that typhoon scores more damage in a 5min fight using sword proc over the arc reaper and axe proc there are a few other concerns to note when using sword over axe talent.<br /><br />For instance, what many people (including synergy Im assuming since this wasnt within his marvelous maths; he didnt add in the chance for an extra attack to the MS strikes) is that the 6% chance for an additional attack doesnt ONLY apply to regular attacks, it can also proc from an MS/whirlwind/overpower. Basically any melee attack can cause the sword proc to activate, including the sword proc itself, although this is extrodanarily rare.<br /><br />So in other words, if this had been factored in the 5 min battle, the typhoon would have beaten the arc. reaper by an even larger margin.<br /><br />5% extra crit from the axe specialiation is great, and a fabulous option for an warrior, but the sword specialisation is at least the equal of it when you factor in its ability to proc off pretty much anything. <br /><br />That said, if u are including impale in your build the extra crit chance would pay off more for the 20% addition damage per crit, but not everyone uses impale, and not everyone uses the exact same talent build either.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am a level 60 hunter, second Alliance hunter to hit 60 on my server. Today I got this sword.<br /><br />I didn't roll for it. Our guild uses a point system, and I was actually near the bottom of the points list. The point is that pretty much all the warriors/paladins passed on it. The difference is that we have a &quot;no idiots&quot; policy in our guild, and many of the warriors and paladins realize that there are better weapons out there for them.<br /><br />Anyone that says that Arcanite Reaper is a better weapon for a warrior is partially right. Reaper is better burst damage and better for pvp - typhoon is better sustained damage and for long battles. <br /><br />Anyone who says that hunters should be using greens &quot;of agility&quot; or &quot;of the monkey&quot; is just a complete !@#$ing moron. Maybe if we didn't have an 8 yard minimum range we wouldn't care about having good melee weapons. <br /><br />Now I'm not saying this is a bad weapon for a warrior, it's definitely a good one. It's also a good weapon for a paladin.<br /><br />The kicker is that this is the BEST two handed melee weapon for a hunter. Period. There are no better ones in the game. <br /><br />For a warrior? Obsidian Edged Blade BLOWS this away. Equal dps, much higher max damage, and +42 strength. Bonereaver's Edge (although a bit harder to get) is also way, way better. <br /><br />For a paladin? Earthshaker is a much better pvp weapon, knockdown = nobody running away. Finkle's Lava Dredger is a GODLY paladin weapon.<br /><br />So while this is not the best weapon for a warrior/paladin, it is by far the best weapon for a hunter. That's why I currently, as a hunter, wield the only Typhoon to ever drop on the Alliance side on my server (horde usually have a stranglehold on Azuregos). <br /><br />There are no better 2h melee weapons in the game for me, this is it. I'll never need another melee weapon again. If a warrior were wielding this, he'd cry when Obsidian Edged Blade dropped. <br /><br />And for the guy who said this: &quot;ok hunters, well good ones that would actually kill a boss like this, know this isn't for them&quot;<br /><br />Any guild that is killing a boss of this magnitude knows that this weapon is for hunters, and that there are far better warrior/paladin weapons in the game. And anyone that thinks hunters should be using green weapons with zero @#$%ing dps should be shot in the face.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol synergy has way too much time on his hands. btw the math you did can be done with a normal calculator don't try and pass yourself off as some math wiz. as for your comment about how proud you were about not namecalling, i am pretty sure dyslexic fu*k is namecalling. 14 year olds like you shoudln't be arguing over a sword in WoW forums you should be experimenting with the wonderful world of masterbation.<br /><br />as for the sword, arcanite may be better for a warrior but not by much. if i had the chance to roll for this i wouldn't say &quot;hmm, i should pass because i have 500 extra gold lying around to spend on a reaper.&quot; <br /><br />warriors- roll<br />pallies- allies suck, don't roll<br />hunters- roll<br />everyone else- don't roll or get blacklisted as a ninja<br /><br />i am still in awe about how long synergy's post was. get a hobby man.</div>

I'm only lvl 55 but I stood back and did my Hunter thing, racked up 7% of the total DPS on this fool too. And guess what happened, 2 of these dropped.<br /><br />Guess what happened next?<br /><br />They both went to Hunters. Know why? Cause our Paladins/Warriors aren't retards! They all -PASSED- on the thing. We hunters didn't outroll anyone, the tanks said 'here ya go man, I have a (insert better tank weapon here) and you could use this more effectively.<br /><br />So, let me just point out to all the greedy warriors and paladins in this forum, that there are a majority of people in your community that are -smarter- than you are and know when to pass off loot to someone who can put it to better use.<br /><br />This is now in my bank, waiting for me to hit 60 =D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>the better argument is the 2% crit 2h axe rare from Tribute Chest, or the 51 dps dagger which also drops off Azu.<br /><br />2% crit can be attained by hunters dual wield in several combinations of blue items. 20 agility can be attained easily by green items. <br /><br />With Typhoon, I do 50k+ damage on magmadar while other 2h warriors end up doing 30-35k. Thats a huge improvement, and on some MC mobs (firelords for example) I often out-dps the rogues and mages with constant sweeping/cleaves + executes. This helps my guild, a typhoon on a hunter is purely a vanity item. The best hunters melee at most 5% of the time. Warriors melee 100% of the time. You dont have to be Einstein to figure out who it benefits most.</div>
