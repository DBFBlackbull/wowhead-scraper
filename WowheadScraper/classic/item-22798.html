Gotta say this weapon is far more powerful than Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros, and it looks cooler to boot! While it does match the Dreadnaught armor in looks, anyone who actually has the whole Dreadnaught armor set should be denied this weapon for the fact that they are obviously for PvE and not PvP which this weapon is clearly set for. And if I ever see a goddamn hunter with this weapon I swear I will #$%^ing kick their ass until they either sell this weapon, disenchant it, or destroy it, cause THIS IS NOT A HUNTER WEAPON!

Warriors\/shamans\/pallies first.  I know if I was doing Naxx with my druid and I somehow got this I'd feel like an ass.  Now lets see why.\n\n46 stam\n20 str\n2% crit.\n\nLets start off with cat form.  Assuming you have HotW, Bonecrusher reward from DM gives roughly the same damage output as this weapon (10 str = 24 AP, 22 AP = ~1 crit).  While this weapon DOES have an additional 46 sta on it come on, a blue quest reward from Dire Maul gives you same damage output in cat!  46 sta is not trivial by any means but if you're in cat, you're looking to do maximum burst damage most of the time.\n\nNow bear.  This mace has no armor.  N'uff said.  Warden staff > this in most cases.  While armor gives you nothing against magic users I'd generally keep my 1k armor and 10 def from warden staff.\n\nWhat about moonkin? If you're a moonkin with natural weapons.. I don't know what to say.\n\nDruids need stats because we don't get any benefit from weapon damage.  Where do we get stats?  Good question.  If you're doing Naxx, all of these weapons will be available to you:\n\nFrom Naxx itself:\n Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian (druid version)\n+28 Stamina\n+28 Intellect\n+27 Spirit\nhealing +300.\n+420 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear\nRestores 11 mana every 5 sec to party members within 30 yards.\n\nFor a loss of 20 sta, and 2% crit you gain so so so much more. You gain a huge 372 AP in forms, +300 healing, 28 int, 27 spi, and 11 mana\/5sec.  This is simply every druid's wet dream.  N'uff said.  \n\nThe End of Dreams from Naxx : [item=22988] Intellect\n+13 Stamina\ndmg\/healing +95. \n+305 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear\nRestores 5 mana per 5 sec. \n\nLoss of 33 stam and 2 crit you gain 257 AP, 13 intellect, +95 to dmg\/healing, and 5 mana\/5sec.  257 AP. On a one hander.  N'uff said.  You can get your crit and sta from somewhere else.\n\nNow lets go alllll the way back to AQ20 which you can almost PuG.\n\nMace of Unending Life: [quest=8708] Strength\n+7 Agility\n+11 Intellect\n+10 Stamina\ndmg\/healing +40. \n+140 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear\n\nFor a loss of 38 sta, and 1.65% crit you gain 120.6 AP, 11 int, +40 dmg\/healing.  This one handed mace from a 20 man gives you a much higher damage output than Might of Menethil with the added bonus of better heals, better nukes (moonfire spam!), and more int with the loss of some survivability.\n\nSo.\nStop calling \"dr00d loot\" on anything with sta\/str on it.","date":"2006-09-20T13:27:13-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I'm also a druid and good god, I would never want this over End of Dreams.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>greengoo</b></h3>The problem with Sulfurus is that it is a Mace. Speccing maces for warriors does not help them increase their damage, like the other specs do. It adds a stun effect at random, versus an extra attack (2% chance) or an extra 5% crit. This logic is what makes many raiders justify the large number of Paladins with Sulfurus compared to warriors. However, due to the extremely powerful nature of MoM, I think we can all assume the Warriors will look past the inadequacies of Mace spec, just this once :)</div>

And no there is no &quot;chance&quot; to get 1000 more damage on a crit it depends on your buffs and the amount of armor your enemy got.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My opinion on this weapon is that it is for Warriors(it's plainly obvious with it's stats to show why a warrior should get this first above all other players), Paladins(they need a good weapon to compensate for the fact that they suck), and perhaps, maybe, Shamans(they do melee often enough to benefit but this weapons stats arent appropriate for them. Gotta say this weapon is far more powerful than Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros, and it looks cooler to boot! While it does match the Dreadnaught armor in looks, anyone who actually has the whole Dreadnaught armor set should be denied this weapon for the fact that they are obviously for PvE and not PvP which this weapon is clearly set for. And if I ever see a goddamn hunter with this weapon I swear I will #$%^ing kick their ass until they either sell this weapon, disenchant it, or destroy it, cause THIS IS NOT A HUNTER WEAPON! I am sick and tired of hunter's claiming every weapon that drops is a hunter weapon, what the hell are you hunters going to do next? Claim a wand is a hunter weapon?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Here is the way I see it:<br />If you even have the opportunity to get this, warrior and pally allike, then you are in a guild that has successfully completed Naxx with the death of Kel'Thuzad.

Both of yah are gonna use it for the same reasons....so why is your reason any better than mine? In reality it's just greed in most cases. I've said it so many times. I lose stuff too to classes that can make good use of it as well. Just cause you can use it the best does not mean I lose it by default...unless it's obvious. Never gonna get anywhere that way. If we go by that then only &quot;Pure&quot; classes will get the good stuff while the hybrids get nothing. *buzzing sound* Your guild will fall apart in no time. LOL! Just a thought for you folks in case you're still thinking such ignorant thoughts ^^. If I'm Ret and you're a war...I will roll for it too. Tough.<br /><br />Had to get that out there.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>all you guys saying &quot;dr00d weapon!&quot; are probably not even in BWL yet or don't know how druids work. Warriors/shamans/pallies first. I know if I was doing Naxx with my druid and I somehow got this I'd feel like an ass. Now lets see why.<br /><br />46 stam<br />20 str<br />2% crit.<br /><br />Lets start off with cat form. Assuming you have HotW, Bonecrusher reward from DM gives roughly the same damage output as this weapon (10 str = 24 AP, 22 AP = ~1 crit). While this weapon DOES have an additional 46 sta on it come on, a blue quest reward from Dire Maul gives you same damage output in cat! 46 sta is not trivial by any means but if you're in cat, you're looking to do maximum burst damage most of the time.<br /><br />Now bear. This mace has no armor. N'uff said. Warden staff &gt; this in most cases. While armor gives you nothing against magic users I'd generally keep my 1k armor and 10 def from warden staff.<br /><br />What about moonkin? If you're a moonkin with natural weapons.. I don't know what to say.<br /><br />Druids need stats because we don't get any benefit from weapon damage. Where do we get stats? Good question. If you're doing Naxx, all of these weapons will be available to you:<br /><br />From Naxx itself:<br /> Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian (druid version)<br />+28 Stamina<br />+28 Intellect<br />+27 Spirit<br />healing +300.<br />+420 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear<br />Restores 11 mana every 5 sec to party members within 30 yards.<br /><br />For a loss of 20 sta, and 2% crit you gain so so so much more. You gain a huge 372 AP in forms, +300 healing, 28 int, 27 spi, and 11 mana/5sec. This is simply every druid's wet dream. N'uff said. <br /><br />The End of Dreams from Naxx : <a href="/classic/item=22988/the-end-of-dreams">The End of Dreams</a> Intellect<br />+13 Stamina<br />dmg/healing +95. <br />+305 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear<br />Restores 5 mana per 5 sec. <br /><br />Loss of 33 stam and 2 crit you gain 257 AP, 13 intellect, +95 to dmg/healing, and 5 mana/5sec. 257 AP. On a one hander. N'uff said. You can get your crit and sta from somewhere else.<br /><br />Now lets go alllll the way back to AQ20 which you can almost PuG.<br /><br />Mace of Unending Life: <a href="/classic/quest=8708/mace-of-unending-life">Mace of Unending Life</a> Strength<br />+7 Agility<br />+11 Intellect<br />+10 Stamina<br />dmg/healing +40. <br />+140 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear<br /><br />For a loss of 38 sta, and 1.65% crit you gain 120.6 AP, 11 int, +40 dmg/healing. This one handed mace from a 20 man gives you a much higher damage output than Might of Menethil with the added bonus of better heals, better nukes (moonfire spam!), and more int with the loss of some survivability.<br /><br />So.<br />Stop calling &quot;dr00d loot&quot; on anything with sta/str on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I see a few warriors wanting this only for the massive top end dmg and the 95.3 DPS. I also see Paladins and Shamans Drooling over it. All Paladins and Shamans should alteast try for a full set of tier 2.5 to use with this weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Before I saw the new talents, spells, and what not from BC, I thought it would be an even roll between warriors and pallies. Mainly cuz, as stated before, in raids, fury warriors pwn face over arms for dps. While it is true that warriors do hecka more dmg with this than a pally would, ret pallies can use it in pve when there is more than enough healing (ex. patchwerk, gluth).<br /><br />With BC in mind, I think it should go to a pally first. With the new talents and crusader strike coming back, pallies will be given a dps role in raids. Their highest dps output weapon would undoubtedly be a 2h. With warriors, it will still be dual wield. <br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 24th 2006 12:31am by Arttemistwo</i></div>

The only problem is that is if you want to be a dps shaman you will never get this weapon. Endgame raids nerf all hybrid classes and lock them into retarded boring backup healing, buffing, mana regen rolls. Raid gear even further emphasizes this. I love WOW, but the engame raids are really lame for all except guild leaders, tanks, mages and warlocks. I'd love this weapon for my 60 Shammy, but the grind for the Unstoppable force will actually be fun unlike doing a million raids to be allowed/able to tag along for a AQ40 run. Watching Rag go down once was more than enough excitement for me in one night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>People dont understand the benefits of a paladin on melee. What you do is have 2 holy paladins judge light and wisdom on the target then have a ret paladin judge crusader. That ret paladin then stays on melee and uses crusader strike to keep all 3 judgements refreshed. So with one good paladin on melee you get extra mana for casters, extra healing for melee, and if the paladin has all talent improvements to seal of the crusader than all melee get +3% to crit chance on that target. It isn't a question of dps output.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you think that a ret paladin wont do just as well or better with this weapon than a warrior, you are sorely mistaken.<br /><br />3.8 speed weapon with 400+ damage is geared towards arms. However sinse mace spec is so poor compared to the other specs, a warrior is essentually losing 5 talent point speccing maces.<br /><br />Fury this is still a great DPS weapon, but slower speeds and low attack power make other weapons like Untames or Ashkandi effect the Bloodthirst more.<br /><br />Paladin? Don't have to worry about spec, +5 maces from human racial... Huge raw damage for Seal of Command procs which ignore armor. +2% crit which effects your seal of command crits as well...<br /><br />Seems to me just as feasable as a DPS weapon for Ret paladins as warriors.<br /><br />This is a greed item IMHO, its noit a tanking item for wars, its not a dagger for rogues, its not a +healing item for paladins/druids...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think not, I wouldn’t waist 5 points on mace specialization.<br />Also a Reto Paladin would use this better than you think.<br />Hell a Reckoning Pally with this will one shot a heavy Plate war, make a Paladin and see what they can do.<br />And besides, after the expiation comes out it looks like wars are going to be walking with shields again.<br />Don’t be greedy, if you think you deserve one then be an ID10T and pull this out on a raid, lol.<br />You know you wont get a chance to use it like you think.<br />25man raids for 40 man instances. <br />This will be a solo and a 5man fun run weapon. Now I have a war and when I first seen this weapon, I wanted it. But after looking at the +damage<br />I would get from it; I'm just starting to think wars would be better off<br />with a Polearm or Axe for +crit's. Flame all you want but think of your <br />guild before yourself. And again let the guild and DKP Decide the home for this Mace.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Considering PVP classes and theyr damage/surviverability i won't argue with any class able to weild this... <br /><br />The weapon is uppon a build choice. I realy would like to see an arms warrior against a retribution paladin both equiped with this weapon in epic PVP sets. <br /><br />Outcome would be like this:<br />IF the paladin doesn't fail on repentance and hammer of justice, the warrior is dead in 43 seconds! In this time the warrior won't be able to do anything for 22 seconds (16 sec active stuns + 6 sec repentance). Furthermore the paladin's bubble will hold warrior out of damage for further 12 seconds. That makes 34 seconds where a paladin can't be damaged and still can (and will) do damage to the enemy. With judgements cooldown 8 seconds the warriror will be judged 5 times and hit (pure speculation) 12 times (SoC more then 40% proc rate makes this 20 hits)....&lt;.&lt;<br />The total damage output (average) would be somewhere arround 7.350 HP in 43 seconds.<br />So if a warriror can't down the paladin inside 9 seconds from the fight beginning, the warrior is dead.<br /><br />It's just a conclusion and yes, a warrior can do more damage with this nasty weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I cant tell you who i am, but i have infact killed kel'thuzad 3 times now.<br /><br />This is a warrior weapon. But the majority of naxx warriors (that auccually can top dps) perfer DW fury.<br /><br />Yes its true pallys can dps, but not quite at the same level as Warriors, rouges, hunters, mages, warlocks, etc...<br /><br />No feral druid would touch this, because we ALL know feral tank &gt; feral dps.<br /><br />Well shammans i dunno but as far as ive seen in my pvp experience windfury shammans=ftl (except a few that are super pimps)<br /><br />Pallys would probably get this, but not because they want it but because the warriors dont want it. Pallidins in our guild are SMART and know there roles as endgame healers.<br /><br />But really if you havent taken in the experience of naxx raiding dont bother posting here. Your probably 3 years old or mentally disfunctional if you feel the need to aurgue with people you dont know on fourms.</div>

Look at this video:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrnzhjNtPrg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrnzhjNtPrg</a><br /><br />That warrior uses:<br /><a href="/classic/item=18877/high-warlords-greatsword">High Warlord's Greatsword</a> what he would do with this beauty! And moreover, when BC comes out, warriors will have an ability called: &quot;Endless Rage&quot;, witch does that warriors can do as many attacks as they can within 10 sec, without loosing rage pts.<br /><br />With other words: Might of Menethil PWNS! <br /><br />((It is good with Shaman WF + Might of Menethil aswell =) ))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>All guilds that can down Kel'Thuzad, obviously can down The Four Horsemen, which means that all warriors have a chance to get Ashbringer, which means a legendary two-hander in the expansion. By using that you can determine, that Paladins can have the chance, and let me repeat, CHANCE, to get Might of Menethil because a Lvl. 70 legendary (assumed) will most definitely out do a Lvl. 60 Epic. As a paladin however, I would much rather go for Hammer of the Twisting Nethers, and at least the first time that Might of Menethil drops pass and give the Warriors a chance before the next time. Hell I'd take it even if I was the very last to get it, unless I had something better, which can be doubted very much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Even with TBC in mind, loot priority for what is obviously a PvP toy should be based on DKP alone. Saying a Paladin should get this over a Warrior is stupid. They're both on equal ground when it comes to MoM. You shouldn't even be regarding this as a future raiding weapon, it'll be replaced when you're 70 by raid drops, crafted weapons, or pvp rewards.<br /><br />As for PvE Roles, some are being changed, but Paladins still wont be taken into raids for their DPS. There will most likely be a Feral Druid and a couple Enhancement Shamans for melee groups, but Retribution Paladins still don't offer anything usefull for raids.<br /><br />Paladins should just be happy that they'll be able to rape faces in PvP when TBC comes out, and lord it over the pvp-gimped warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>effyouzion</b></h3>One of the three best two-handed weapons in Classic WoW, along with <a href="/classic/item=21134/dark-edge-of-insanity">Dark Edge of Insanity</a> and <a href="/classic/item=22691/corrupted-ashbringer">Corrupted Ashbringer</a>.<br /><br />Dark Edge is comparable to Might of Menethil on a warrior. The proc on Dark Edge acts as an equivalent to mace specialization, while Dark Edge also benefits from axe specialization. The end result is that Dark Edge crits more often, while MoM has more raw damage.<br /><br />Ashbringer has the most burst damage of the three thanks to its proc and sword specialization, but the extra damage comes at the cost of -25 stamina. Given the large stamina values on the other two weapons, this is a swing in 500-670 health, which is easily 10% (or more!) of your unbuffed health pool in aggressive gear.<br /><br />In PvE, Dark Edge is the best by default, because two-handers are only truly viable on horde side (thanks to Windfury Totem) and only Orcs get two-handed axe skill. <br /><br />As a warrior, you would be happy with any of these three weapons!</div>
