<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For druids, go bear form and use frenzied regen when you have 100 rage, i'm a resto druid and i can solo these just fine without using innervate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I did not die once and I was able to defeat the 52 and 53s.&nbsp; I never tried the 54s but don't think its possible for a 53 mage.&nbsp; I was only able to defeat them because im an ice mage and was keeping them back freezing getting lucky freeze traps.&nbsp; BTW I didn't see anyone post WHERE they are so here is where they are 54,85 and everywhere around it.&nbsp; Without cosmos you'll see them just past the dragonkin elites they are further east.&nbsp; Southeast of the entire map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Not hard at all, just gotta keep a distance. Frost Nova, and cone of cold. Most of them mobs were 55 and 54 I encountered thow.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I soloed them as a 55 Rogue total EZ mode!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>soloed as 56 holy priest, not easy but not hard.<br />had only problem with Cliff Walkers as they do stun.<br />52-54 elites at 52.80</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Doable as a 56 rogue, the 52/53 at least. Use all CD's and take your time.<br />I used crippling poison in slow MH and instant in faster OH<br />(crippling is good for staying out of reach if gouge fails or if you need energy)<br /><br />Cheap shot, backstab, hemo, Kidney shot, backstab<br />Gouge (healing potion might be used here)and evasion<br />Sinister strike x2, Hemo, Cold blood, eviscerate.<br /><br />If necessary blind + bandage<br /><br />(backstab),gouge, backstab hemo, sinister strike (x2),cheap shot and backstab should make him fall.<br /><br />Died 4 times in the process due to ui-failure (dunno if it's the new patch, but my stealthbar wont turn to normal after going in combat,<br />but after killing 4 I had what I wanted :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I solod them quite easily (lvl 60 rogue); the lvl 52,53 and 54 ones were ok. I died on the lvl 55 ones. So (duh!) choose only the lower level ones. Drops are just as good (2 or 3 veins per kill). A green cape dropped for me from a lvl 53 one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went to Azshara and killed roughly 20 giants without a single drop.<br /><br />I reckon you actually <b>have to start the quest</b> before you start killing the giants for the veins. Rather silly but typical of BRD questlines.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The pattern for blue dragonscale shoulders drop off cliff breakers, so farm those for the quest &quot;The Love Potion&quot; and you might get lucky. If you go to the south side of Azshara, you might want to swim out to Hydraxis and get his quests while you are there.<br /><br />3 of these veins dropped on every kill for me, so it was only four kills. I did it solo by carefully choosing targets to avoid adds and resting plenty between fights.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SpamHard</b></h3>Absolutely soloable for a mid 50s+ druid. Did this as a 56 resto druid, aiming for the 53 and 54 cliff thunderers to the south and had very little issue. Each one dropped 1 to 3 silver, had to kill 5 of them in total. For resto druids you can make use of everything and take advantage of that nice mana pool. Started with a couple of casting rotations; starfire, moonfire, insect, faerie into nature's grasp, back up, repeat the process. Once they catch back up, throw on a reju and a regrowth, refresh moonfire and insect, then go bear to tank the heavy hits. I just auto-attacked until health was below 1/2, then frenzied regen to use up all that rage and heal back to full. They should die at that point but if you're getting low on health again war stomp/bash, throw on another reju and regrowth (and moon/insect if you can spare the mana) and bear it again. Happy hunting to all druids out there, especially my resto pals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DadRage</b></h3>I was able to solo the lvl 53 giants as a 56 Rogue, but I had to burn all my damage cooldowns as well as blind and bandage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>scoolio</b></h3>Soloed these as a 58 mage (Above average gear for level) without crazy buffs but some of the pulls were close calls (ice mage). Didn't use any potions but came super close a few times. I would kill the Thunderhead Patriarchs (Blue griffon looking things) and then pull the Elites back and forth between the dead Patriarch to avoid picking up a second mob. Be careful not to pull the Moosehead Courser's with AOE effects or you will die. It would be best to bring a friend for safety but if you're decently geared and careful you can solo these as a 58 more than likely.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>scoolio</b></h3>If you've turned in the quest in the BRD bar area for the Love Potion quest and have some &quot;extra&quot; Giant Silver Vein feel free to delete it.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
