First off there are a lot of conflicting messages here... some people think this drops off of the Nagas... to my knowledge it doesn't.. I've never seen it drop. I got mine by clicking the cat statues that are scattered about in Darkshore. When I click them I mostly get a lot of grey loots called \"Cat Figurine\" but every once in a while I get attacked by a Ghost Saber. I decided after skinning one that I could probably tame one, so I put my pet that I usually use in the stables and came back to seek out another Ghost Saber. Sure enough, about the 10th statue that I clicked on out popped one, and I did tame it successfully. Mind you I am 2 lvls above it and it was really quite easy. After you have tamed it, it will still appear like a ghost and follow you around like all the other pets, and fight for you just the same... you need to be a hunter to do this though.\n\nIf there is something else that comes out like some glowing thing that you can use to summon a pet, that is not the same pet that you tame... the pet you tame attacks you and is not a temporary pet like the Yeti.\n\nAnyhow..

I spent the next hour or so running about killing Naga - including Lady Vespira, which netted me a Black Pearl Ring - just to make sure it didn't dissipate. The Ghost Saber isn't temporary, it stayed with me the whole time - including completing the @#$%^& \"Gyromast's Revenge\" quest, which pissed me off so much the first time that I never went back.\n\nOh, to complete the story, I opened a third statue to see if anything else was there - got another grey figurine.  Fourth I almost literally tripped over watching Cat fight Lady Vespira (before offing her with an Arcane Shot), out popped another grey figurine, and another Ghost Saber - which the one I tamed immediately killed.\n\nSo now i have the Black Pearl Ring, 5 Elixirs of Water Breathing, and one of the coolest pets in the game - easily worth the trip back!

I've yet to see a hunter with this on my server so maybe ill be a first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tamed one. My friend stood next to me and healed me while i tamed him . It is a <br />ghost saber.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 13th 2006 at 5:20am EDT by Yabone</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes, definitely tameable as I just did so myself at lvl20! It took me about an hour of opening up random Cat Figurines before one spawned. As soon as it did another hunter ran up and I was afraid they would try to steal it or kill it. But they left me alone and I was able to tame it without a problem. It is very cool, the one I got was lvl19 so I spent the next hour lvling him up. I still don't have a name for him but so far I am very happy with him!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I killed about 40 of the aqua warriors ect and the damn cat figure will NOT drop! I am about to quit this...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found a cat figurene opened it, looted the figurine, then the ghost cat poped, killed it and looted a glowing cat figurene off of it. It says I can summon a ghost saber to fight for me for 10 mins, is this a 1 time use thing. or can I use it over an over?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">how after 2 years of playing a hunter in WoW is there still an incredbley unique pet like this out there? </div><br /><br />According to your post date you have definately not been playing 2 years...nice try to make yourself seem like a vet though</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Here's how it works. You don't have to have a quest queued to get GhostSaber as a pet. Just go to the Ruins of Mathystra and roam around looking for the little white tiger cat figurines around the ruins. Open them and you'll get a figuring in your inventory. Don't go into the lower areas because they don't spawn there. It took me 12 figurines to get GhostSaber to spawn, but the number seems to vary. He will pop on you and start attacking immediately. Once he spawns you can go into tame mode and get him. I did this at level 42 just to have a unique pet. It was a cinche walking around the ruins since the mobs didn't pose a threat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've gotten them to pop about every 2-3 figurine I open. Been opening them for a while and still no glowing cat figurine. I just set a frost trap, open it up and then boom i have a frozen Ghost Saber. The name &quot;Ghost&quot; In the name should tell you they aren't tameable and that its transparent =p. Just like you can't tame GhostHowl from the Barrens or the Ghost Wolves in SFK.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Re: Cat Figurine ( junk ) when you loot this sometimes you also get attacked by a Ghost Saber ( cat that you can tame ).<br /><br />I have a lot of compliments on my pet and I never ever tell where I got him from... but since I am on this site and this is the pet I have I will tell the people who did their homework to search for this pet and who's eyes have landed here. First off there are a lot of conflicting messages here... some people think this drops off of the Nagas... to my knowledge it doesn't.. I've never seen it drop. I got mine by clicking the cat statues that are scattered about in Darkshore. When I click them I mostly get a lot of grey loots called &quot;Cat Figurine&quot; but every once in a while I get attacked by a Ghost Saber. I decided after skinning one that I could probably tame one, so I put my pet that I usually use in the stables and came back to seek out another Ghost Saber. Sure enough, about the 10th statue that I clicked on out popped one, and I did tame it successfully. Mind you I am 2 lvls above it and it was really quite easy. After you have tamed it, it will still appear like a ghost and follow you around like all the other pets, and fight for you just the same... you need to be a hunter to do this though.<br /><br />If there is something else that comes out like some glowing thing that you can use to summon a pet, that is not the same pet that you tame... the pet you tame attacks you and is not a temporary pet like the Yeti.<br /><br />Anyhow.. I have photos and such if anyone wants to see them just email me at heartshinegirl at yahoo dot com. :)<br /><br />Otherwise good luck catching yours!<br /><br />They look really cool.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 26th 2006 at 9:40am PDT by heartshinegirl</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>my lvl 20 hunter opened about 5 figurines, made sure health and mana were 100% before i started. got the ghost saber tamed on first try. It is possible, but make sure you have all mobs killed around figurine before you open it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>At level 31 I found out about this. Decided to grab myself a Ghost Saber for a pet. While doing this I figured I would grab some info for others.<br /><br /> grabbed 31 figurines total. Got 5 Ghost Sabers (1st one was tamed and I didn't write down the cord).<br /><br />3rd Ghost Saber I received Glowing Cat Figurine. <br /><br />These were the main cords I found the cat figurine at repeated times:<br />61,21*<br />61,19<br />61,17<br />60,17<br />60,16<br />60,15*<br />59,24<br />59,23*<br />58,24**<br />58,14<br /><br />* - Where I got a Ghost Saber<br />** - Where I received the Glowing Cat Figurine<br /><br />I do believe that it maybe possible for more than one figurine to be spawned. <br /><br />And for those who say this mob is not tamable...<a href="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y123/stolenart/Picture2.png" rel="nofollow">here's proof it is</a><br />It's a little harder to tame and took two tries for me to tame mine, but I got her.<br /><br />Those of you who don't want to download an add-on here's a macro you can use (also included a quick how-to make a macro):<br /><br />&quot;/macro&quot; in chat bar then give name and choose a picture. Then put the following in the &quot;Commands&quot; area:<br /><br />/script local x,y=GetPlayerMapPosition(&quot;player&quot;);<br />SELECTED_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(string.format(&quot;Location:<br />%d,%d&quot;,x*100,y*100))<br /><br />Hope some of this information help :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Random spawn, for the Ghost Saber to appear. Will be either lvl 19 or 20, so make sure you're at least lvl 20 when you get your pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>or maybe it's on a timer?<br /><br />i am a hunter, was doing the relic quest with my cat out, stumbled across these, opened one, out popped the ghost saber but it immediately attacked me so my cat killed it.<br /><br />i stabled my pet, went back to see if i could tame one, opened 6 figurines and no ghost saber popped.<br /><br />has anyone repeated this? or tried to tame one?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Do the 'Cat Figurines' (not glowing) do anything, and why are they selling for 1g each! If that's true I'll farm them more often lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found the figurine by fault, I was on a quest and saw it behind a wall and opened it. The ghost saber spawned as soon as I opened it, and although it killed me the first time, I went back and tamed it. It was at level 20 when I got it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>10 of these stolen from the Cat Figurines (random spawns all over the area) seems to 'force' the Ghost Saber to spawn (usually attacking you from behind).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>how after 2 years of playing a hunter in WoW is there still an incredbley unique pet like this out there? most pets are common knowledge to hunters this long after release (1.0 pets, that worg that did shadow dmg, gamooras 900k armor that doesnt stay after taming etc...) but then i read about this on hunter forums, think its complete BS and low and behold its true? omg! too bad i just tamed broken tooth for my 3rd stable slot like 2 weeks ago, otherwise id get one of these in a heartbeat even though their atk speed is sucky<br /><br />but btw, what do the statues look like? im running around, ive seen different objects scattered among the ruins that look like they could be opened or part of a quest or something...stone spheres, goblets, nelf statues...not any cat statues tho. someone post a screen!<br /><br />I finally found the cat figurine. And it is exactly what it sounds like, you can't miss it, if you were like me and thought you must be missing it someplace. They are just mini tigers, that u can loot.<br /><br />I got a spawn on my 5th statue loot, and beastial lore confirmed that it is tameable. however the mob did not drop the , which they have a 30% chance of doing, so I did not get to check if that guardian version is tameable. However I'm still at it, and going to find out some time soon hopefully...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For anyone who reads the posts about this being &quot;NOT TAMEABLE&quot;, FYI I got a grey cat figurine out of one of the statues - the only one I opened - in the ruins when I was ~lvl 18, didn't think anything of it but saved it in the bank 'cause I like cats (current pet - my first, though I have tamed and abandoned several since - is a Feral Nightsaber, now lvl 38). Anyway, I ran out of banks slots and decided to put the figurine up for auction, sort of as a joke. Luckily, I checked this site and found these posts, and immediately went back to check it out.<br /><br />2 facts: (1) yes, they did spawn on every other statue I opened (first one gave another grey figurine loot, second one spawned grey figurine AND a lvl 20 Ghost Saber!); (2) they are quite tameable, I tamed mine with no problem (as lvl 39 Hunter). I spent the next hour or so running about killing Naga - including Lady Vespira, which netted me a Black Pearl Ring - just to make sure it didn't dissipate. The Ghost Saber isn't temporary, it stayed with me the whole time - including completing the @#$%^&amp; &quot;Gyromast's Revenge&quot; quest, which pissed me off so much the first time that I never went back.<br /><br />Oh, to complete the story, I opened a third statue to see if anything else was there - got another grey figurine. Fourth I almost literally tripped over watching Cat fight Lady Vespira (before offing her with an Arcane Shot), out popped another grey figurine, and another Ghost Saber - which the one I tamed immediately killed.<br /><br />So now i have the Black Pearl Ring, 5 Elixirs of Water Breathing, and one of the coolest pets in the game - easily worth the trip back! My only problem is trying to get him to level up to my hunter without killing him in evry melee!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sonicsx</b></h3>2019 WoW Classic Edition<br /><br />Cat Figurine Locations:<br />57,20<br />58,15<br />58,24<br />59,18 (lower area, this popped several times)<br />61,21<br />60,16<br /><br />Looted 10 of these now and haven't had a Ghost Saber spawn yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>K9kamper</b></h3>Had one on my Hunter years ago ... nice to see it is still in Classic ... got mine on the 8th statue, didn't try for more and the glowing statue ... I got what I came for :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dani1973</b></h3>Did this for my hunters and ended with a total of 27 figurines.<br />First one was 10, second 12, third 3 and fourth only 2.<br /><br />Guess I was a little lucky on the last 2, seems to be a 10% chance or a little better.<br /><br />On the fourth my hunter died exactly at the end of the tame so I tamed it with the last hunter (5th) while running back in ghost form.<br />For some reason they both had the tame. Lucky me I guess.</div>
