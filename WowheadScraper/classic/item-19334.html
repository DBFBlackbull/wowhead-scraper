However you're not saying it's a hunter weapon anyhow.  \n\nThe proc is STR, not AP, so it belongs in the hands of classes that calculate strength as 2 AP, instead of 1.  IIRC this is Paladins, Warriors, and Shamans.  Pity that Shamans cannot use swords, because this would be a terrific enhancement weapon.\n\nDue to proc-style combat, this can make paladins very happy.  Crusader enchant, this proc, and a seal can ensure *something* happens every 3 or 4 swings.  It really makes a class with not (current) instant melee ability more fun.  IMHO Warriors (who go 2 hand) should desire more base DPS, slower speed, and more consistant stats.

The likelyhood of it is completely dependent upon the situation. In my experience with MMO players, the odds of having a non-guild highly organized raid accomplish something like this are about as good as winning the lottery three times in the same week with only two drawings a week.\n\nUltimately when this drops, whomever gets it is entirely situational. Some guilds will make ultimatums that a Warrior get it because it's a high dps, HUGE +STR proc weapon, etc. Other guilds may allow or even give it to Hunters or Paladins in the raid because THEY CAN. \n\nThe reason Hunters want this item is because they see a high agility and a sick dps. To me that means they want it for PvP. And just to make myself clear on this, I believe them to be PvE-server Hunters who want this to PvP when they feel like; knowing the edge this kind of melee weapon can give them. There's no sense for a raiding guild to give this to a Hunter, because how often do Hunters melee in raids? Not much sense in giving it to a Hunter who's just planning on using it when farming to save ammo either, but all that doesn't matter because when it drops it's going to be up to the raid who gets it, so maybe Hunters will. What's the logic of arguing this publicly with people you'll never go to BWL with?\n\n...I guess my argument all comes down to this...\n\nI'm going to do 40-Shaman raids on BWL until every single one of the 40 Shamans has this weapon.\n\nWhy you ask?\n\nBecause it makes about as much sense as this many posts on YET ANOTHER public flame-argument of what classes should get loot-rights to certain items. Remember, no matter what race the toon is, the player is Human. That makes 99.04% of MMOers by definition selfish !@#%s. They want the item because they want the best for themselves and will argue everyone into the ground over why they should get it...reason is let go to constant argument, knowing that continuing the argument until the other side quits is more likely going to be successful then a legitimate respectful debate on the subject.\n\n:) That's all I've got to vent for now. For all of those going to flame me, enjoy. I don't care. Don't expect me to respond.

I know the agility is good, so is this:\n[item=19106] you are, simple.. 21 agility from an AV quest ( as i said pvp).\nDPS melee weapons go to warriors first simple because they can only dps on raids at close range. Maybe you hunters can all melee and have warriors stand back and range on raganos and see how far you all get. \nIts a simple concept: Warriors and rogues melee becasue thats there best form of damage, Hunters range because its there best form of damage. So hold your tonuge, live with the concept and once melees have there weapons, then roll on them.

If a guild allowed a Hunter to go for this over a Warrior then the people in that guild should just delete their accounts lol.\n\nJust sit back and laugh, don't get worked up over it.\n\nEdited, Fri Sep  9 10:33:51 2005","date":"2005-09-09T14:27:00-05:00","rating":-6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Othendras","importedSubject":"Lol"},{"commentv2":1,"number":143,"id":3074254,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"How can you say that is a waste on a pally, That is insane damage and if we proc SoC with it, good god cause SoC is weapon damage based if your not forgetting Nilloe...not to mention who knows how pallies will be after 1.9patch, we could be a lot better then u think.","date":"2005-10-22T19:52:54-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"CDB","importedSubject":"pally"},{"commentv2":1,"number":144,"id":3074255,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"any one know the proc % cause OEB has the +42 STR and  for a fury warrior thats nice but this has just a chance to incress your STR.  so im just wondering","date":"2006-01-09T07:14:46-06:00","rating":-4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ValdtheDark","importedSubject":"proc rate"},{"commentv2":1,"number":145,"id":3074256,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Human female model with UTB:\n\nhttp:\/\/patchtimer.org\/images\/utb.jpg\n\ngod this site sucks ass\n\nEdited, Wed Apr 12 14:39:12 2006","date":"2006-04-12T19:42:25-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ginblackhand","importedSubject":"hi"},{"commentv2":1,"number":146,"id":3074257,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"this is a gorgeous weapon. its for a dps warrior or hunter , or a dps pally","date":"2006-06-13T12:50:12-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Pally cant DPS and hunter doesnt really need a ownage melee weapon","creationdate":"2006-06-15T17:51:36-05:00","id":1282728,"rating":-3,"commentid":3074257,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Skyblaze","importedSubject":"RE: gorgeous"},{"body":"Hunters need to stop trying to take melee weapons, get their quest staff and leave the rest to Warriors.","creationdate":"2006-07-05T16:24:10-05:00","id":1282727,"rating":0,"commentid":3074257,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Shadowstark","importedSubject":"gorgeous"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Detharius","importedSubject":"gorgeous"},{"commentv2":1,"number":147,"id":3074258,"nreplies":11,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Discuss.","date":"2006-07-26T18:27:33-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Shadow priests and feral druids are one thing, but even the most rigid-minded raid has DPS warriors.

If u look at the stats on this weapon, the class it would benefit most are warriors, plain and simple. Paly's that want to dps and want it, thats fine, but u aint touchin it till every warr in the guild is wielding one first, thats how we roll. The Herald of Woe is the best Paly weapon other than the Sulfuron in the game, so if a warr wanted a Herald of Woe, well he'd have to wait until no other paly's wanted to look at it. Thats how it should be, palys cant do everything as well as warrs cuz id love to see a raid grp go in and fight Nef with no warrs and see how much they hold agg, and if u gonna post and say i seen it or did it, link the frikkin video. Now as far as calculations go TUB gives u 300 to STR. for warrs thats 600 AP! Add Crusader and you got another 200 AP. So it definetly would help the warriors out (no matter the spec). And this thing about a def spec getting it, so what if they do. Its not like they cant respec after it drops, i know ive done it b4 for certian weapons. Bottom line is you can all complain about how much u pay a month and what u deserve to roll on (rolling in the first place is upsurd to me for 40-mans, dkp all the way) but when you join a guild you agree to certain rules and regulations, and only an idiot would join a guild not knowing what those are.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Morrik</b></h3>Excellent weapon for a Warrior or even a Hunter. Warriors have priority in my guild due to not having many of them. Has a surprising high drop rate it would seem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2196</b></h3>An excellent warrior weapon, and although the 22 agility would make it a pretty nice hunter weapon with a 25 agility enchant, the melee proc is normally enough to discourage any hunter from bidding on it. There are far better hunter weapons, and generally 1H weapon combinations yield the best stats for hunters anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3118</b></h3>2 Bone Slicing Hatchets<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18737">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18737</a><br /><br />are far superior for hunters. However you're not saying it's a hunter weapon anyhow. <br /><br />The proc is STR, not AP, so it belongs in the hands of classes that calculate strength as 2 AP, instead of 1. IIRC this is Paladins, Warriors, and Shamans. Pity that Shamans cannot use swords, because this would be a terrific enhancement weapon.<br /><br />Due to proc-style combat, this can make paladins very happy. Crusader enchant, this proc, and a seal can ensure *something* happens every 3 or 4 swings. It really makes a class with not (current) instant melee ability more fun. IMHO Warriors (who go 2 hand) should desire more base DPS, slower speed, and more consistant stats. For 2h Fury, a spec becoming very popular, this works out as a great grinding tool (+600 AP ) but the proc rate doesn't warrant the stat cut for total raid DPS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6684</b></h3>absolutely not a hunter weapon, the 300 str proc makes it warrior priority hands down, plus with the agi attack power nerf zin'rokh would give way more agi than this even without an enchant</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nolimit</b></h3>It's nice weapon but if your guild is doing OK in other instances you can get better weapons, even in ZG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7121</b></h3>With crusader enchant, this is arguably the best sword in BWL. Proc for UTB is 300 str, and proc for crusader is 100 str. total of 400 STR if they both proc x 2 AP (for a warrior 1 str = 2 ap) = 800 AP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8067</b></h3>I'd say this procs...maybe once every 12 hits.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3>Crusader + UTB proc rocks with Bloodthirst. Can easy crit with Bloodthirst for 2000 when the proc is active + crusader. I Would prefer UTB over Ashkandi and Draketalon Cleaver for a 2H fury spec warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>one of the best weapons in the game</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Why should a hunter win this roll over a warrior or a pally? Oh oh it has agility on it, and any weapon with agility = a hunter weapon right? Wrong.<br /><br />Im currently in a guild that does MC weekly and hasn't even started on BWL and I hear hunters always complaining about wanting it.<br /><br />Hunters, you do ranged damage, you're the only class who can put out mega dps with a gun/xbow/bow why would you want a weapon designed for a melee class. You only melee when you wing clip and then run off. Giving this item to a hunter is a complete waste of the proc. And any hunter who complains about that deserves to lose the dkp they would spend on this item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On top of that, Lok'Delar with a +25 agi on it blows this weapon out of the water.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is DESTINY's bigger brother, more dps more stats more buff</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>my guild is Practicing BWL now we killed Razgor for 3 Times now and he didnt drop it but if he does i can't say Pallies Deserve it first tho im a Pally but here it is Warriors&gt;Paladins&gt;Hunters <br />and Hunters Can i ask you what are you going to do With +300 Str put it in your ass huh . and For Warriors/Paladins Who have Put on it Crusader and it will Be One of The Most Best Weapons in WOW , trust me , I think Hunters are Trying to Hide There Retarded Armor it Looks Like someone Just #$%^ted and Made That Armor ( i don't mean the Stats i mean The Outside Look) so they want a good 2H Weapon even if it means Taking it from those Who use it Better so they can Hide there Gay Armor .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The only reason I could see a hunter taking this item over a warrior/pally is if they did an extreme amount of PvPing. Its true hunters occasionally melee but normally only when they are forced into it. Now any hunter that is forced into melee is going to want to do as much damage in as little time as possible so that they can get back out of melee range and start dishing out their heavy ranged DPS. Having basically only one melee attack (Raptor Strike) and it being on a 6 second cooldown hunters have a very limited use of the UTB�s proc. <br /><br />And any smart hunter that receives this item would most likely put 25 agility on it to get the best Ranged AP out of it as they could. However dual wielding two Bone Slicing Hatchets both enchanted with 15 agility would produce better stats than the UTB. <br /><br /><b>Bone Slicing Hatchet</b><br />Binds when picked up<br />One-Hand Axe<br />48 - 90 Damage Speed 1.70<br />(40.6 damage per second)<br />+13 Agility<br />+5 Stamina<br /><br />x2 with 15 agility enchants<br />56 agility = 112 ranged AP<br />10 stam<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><b>The Untamed Blade</b><br />Binds when picked up<br />Two-Hand Sword<br />192 - 289 Damage Speed 3.40<br />(70.7 damage per second)<br />+22 Agility<br />+16 Stamina<br /><br />With 25 agility enchant<br />47 agility = 94 ranged AP<br />16 stam<br /><br />Soooo a hunter taking this item for stats would be losing 18 ranged AP and some crit at the gain of 6 stam. Last time I checked hunters preferred crit and AP to stam. <br /><br />And a hunter that is taking this item for melee would only be seeing a slight upgrade in their damage compared to Lok'delar.<br /><br />Warrior , Pallys , and shards for the guild bank item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>alright understand this Warriors can get full use from TUB, Pallies &quot;can&quot; but nowhere near what a warrior can. as for unters, your screwed, yes the agil is amazing IF you stack a 25 agil enchant on it but dont forget unless your survival (good luck getting into any end game guild with that spec) your simply wasing the proc. think about it, you almost always range, only time you do melee is for wing clip (someone mentioned that earlier) and ALL your dps comes from your bow/gun/xbow.&nbsp; Get 2 bone slicing hatchets and let the classes that can use this weap get it (Im a pally that uses HOS (Halberd of Smiting for those who dont know) and although i would love to get this im saving my points for Herald of Woe, much better for us)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This weapon is obviously made for warriors, because of it's proc. Fact of the matter is, if none of the warriors or paladins want it, then the roll will then go to the hunters, because they too can use it. Obviously none of you know how DPK works, and classes roll on it separately.

I've been searching for a two hander for PVP and UTB is sort of winning me over<br /><br />( I am a hunter ) but the DoW has a lot more stamina and attack power, but I am survival build and the agility will increase my &quot;over all&quot; agility and give me more crit etc. <br /><br />hmm</div>

Until then keep quiet.<br />If i rolled on a ranged epic i bet you would /cry all over forums.<br />If you think u need to melee in pvp then you are realy bad at pvp, and if u let us warriors near u to do melee then youve already lost.<br />Theres many epic range wepons for Hunters just like theres many Epic 2handers for warriors.<br />You have a epic range weapon for pvp and raids right? use it and stop complaining, u dont see warriors complaining on forums about how they NEED a range weapon to be leet in pvp LOL<br />dont post on this website again unless you have a complaint that dosnt deserve an ass whooping.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Aug 28 09:41:37 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You know, all these people that don't want Hunters to have this or that weapon can just blow me.<br /><br /> We shouldn't try to get this because it's a &quot;warrior&quot; weapon (nevermind that 3 raids from now the warrior will get a better weapon and vendor this one), you don't want us to get Dal'Rends...what the hell DO you want us to get? <br /><br /> I am SO freakin tired of hearing all this crap about how hunters basically shouldn't try to get better *anything*...I suppose I shouldn't roll on beaststalker gear either right?<br /><br /> I actually got kicked from a raid in Scholo once for rolling on the Ancient Bone Bow because the rogue wanted it (and I didn't even win it). That's how bloody ridiculous this is getting.<br /><br /> To be honest this could just as easily go to a warrior, Paladin or Hunter equally because of the stats on it.<br /><br /> I personally (before I started putting together the beststalker set) went for gear that was +agi and +stam (for a few levels everything I had equppied was monkey gear, right down to the rings), so this weapon definitely is attractive stat-wise.<br /><br /> Why is it that the best gear a Hunter can get is ALWAYS claimed by other classes that are just going to replace it within a few raids?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Seriously though, any class that can equip 2H Swords could potentially get this item. The likelyhood of it is completely dependent upon the situation. In my experience with MMO players, the odds of having a non-guild highly organized raid accomplish something like this are about as good as winning the lottery three times in the same week with only two drawings a week.<br /><br />Ultimately when this drops, whomever gets it is entirely situational. Some guilds will make ultimatums that a Warrior get it because it's a high dps, HUGE +STR proc weapon, etc. Other guilds may allow or even give it to Hunters or Paladins in the raid because THEY CAN. <br /><br />The reason Hunters want this item is because they see a high agility and a sick dps. To me that means they want it for PvP. And just to make myself clear on this, I believe them to be PvE-server Hunters who want this to PvP when they feel like; knowing the edge this kind of melee weapon can give them. There's no sense for a raiding guild to give this to a Hunter, because how often do Hunters melee in raids? Not much sense in giving it to a Hunter who's just planning on using it when farming to save ammo either, but all that doesn't matter because when it drops it's going to be up to the raid who gets it, so maybe Hunters will. What's the logic of arguing this publicly with people you'll never go to BWL with?<br /><br />...I guess my argument all comes down to this...<br /><br />I'm going to do 40-Shaman raids on BWL until every single one of the 40 Shamans has this weapon.<br /><br />Why you ask?<br /><br />Because it makes about as much sense as this many posts on YET ANOTHER public flame-argument of what classes should get loot-rights to certain items. Remember, no matter what race the toon is, the player is Human. That makes 99.04% of MMOers by definition selfish !@#%s. They want the item because they want the best for themselves and will argue everyone into the ground over why they should get it...reason is let go to constant argument, knowing that continuing the argument until the other side quits is more likely going to be successful then a legitimate respectful debate on the subject.<br /><br />:) That's all I've got to vent for now. For all of those going to flame me, enjoy. I don't care. Don't expect me to respond. (It's cause I'm just over-awed by j00 1337 skills and far too much a n00b to have any legitimate opinion...damm my inferiority...damm I say)<br /><br />Edited, Tue Oct 4 19:37:36 2005</div>

Why must everyone carry on about who deserves what, i come to this website and read these posts hoping for usful information or a screen shot, im sick of having to sift through all this garbage of who thinks what item is for what class.<br />Use your brains: To be in BWL means your in a good and organised guild, and MC drops help you in raid progrssion. So when on a raid do u see Hunters meleeing in MC or BWL or even onyxia for that matter. If u want a pvp weapon, pvp for it. I know the agility is good, so is this:<br /><a href="/classic/item=19106/ice-barbed-spear">Ice Barbed Spear</a> you are, simple.. 21 agility from an AV quest ( as i said pvp).<br />DPS melee weapons go to warriors first simple because they can only dps on raids at close range. Maybe you hunters can all melee and have warriors stand back and range on raganos and see how far you all get. <br />Its a simple concept: Warriors and rogues melee becasue thats there best form of damage, Hunters range because its there best form of damage. So hold your tonuge, live with the concept and once melees have there weapons, then roll on them. No need to fill the forums with uless posts.<br />I hope this stops all further posts on this issue.<br />Thankyou For your time<br /><br />Edited, Tue Aug 16 20:54:20 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First off, there is no such thing as a melee hunter. If you say that you are, you are kidding yourself and no one else. Myself? I am a hunter. <br /><br />Every warrior in my guild has a combination of epic 1hd, 2hd weapons. I pose a question to every single one of you who has posted on this subject. Can you please name me an epic 2hd weapon that is better for a hunter than this?<br /><br />Exactly, you can't. I PvP frequently as well as PvE and there isnt another epic 2hd out there better than this one for a hunter. Yeah, hunters do not spend their time in melee. However, melee is NECESSARY to stay alive. With the new talents, i will have 40% to crit with raptor strike. <br /><br />Warriors have a multitude of other epic 2hd weapons to choose from. LOTS. <br /><br />No, I dont disagree that this weapon is just as much deserved by warriors than hunter. But since every single warrior has to have 4+ epic melee weapons, for god's sake, dont ever let a PVP/PVE hunter have something that is the best thing he c<br />an use. Take your heads out of your asses and realize that there are hunters in your raid guild that have 3x the attendance (and pvp in their spare time) than the worthless warriors that show up as they see fit. <br /><br />This is the last time i ever scroll down to read the mindless garbage you guys post. God forbid that a hunter wants to have and use an epic 2hd weapon that blows away all the other possibilities. Also, forget the Spinal Reaper and the other 3 epic 2hd melee weapons from BWL geared specifically torwards warriors. We better make sure all 5 epic 2hd weapons are only for them! (since warriors are the only class that uses 2hd weapons). Good riddance! you people make me sick</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK THIS IS NOT A !@#$ING HUNTER WEAPON!<br /><br />I hear all this *!@# about hunters getting stuck in melee combat and how a high DPS weapon would help... Well theres better ones out there!<br /><br />Ever think that a WARRIOR might get stuck OUT OF RANGE?<br /><br />Even so, they don't roll on your ranged weapons now do they...<br /><br />gg nub hunters</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Gotta agree with Othendras, everyone posting in here saying they'd &quot;roll&quot; on it is probablly a n00b looking at high level items. There is no rolling on the items that fall in MC, Onyxia, and BWL, b/c you need to be in a guild with an organized point system to get items like these. Loot is ML or possibly FFA (cuz guilds trust their members, and if you ninja'd it no guild would ever take you). Pretty much if a hunter had more DKP than a warrior, sure, they could get one of these babies. But the main question is, would you really want to blow a lot of DKP on an weapon that does nothing for your ranged AP, i.e. your main source of damage? Exactly. Warrior weapon, maybe Pally (MAYBE). My first preference would be for this to go to a warrior, but just me.<br /><br />EDIT: My mistake, there is agility on it so a hunter would be get some ranged AP out of it. But if I were a hunter I'd just dual wield some good 1 handers and put +15 agility on each, which would more than make up for the agility this sword gives.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Sep 20 00:09:26 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok you made me do it...<br /><br />In as much as this weapon has some nice stats for hunters I guess some hunters could be forgiven for trying to get their hands on one. But! It's a 70 dps two handed weapon. What the hell does your average hunter need that for? Did you maybe leave your pet at home? Or did you just never teach him growl? And don't come at me with this melee hunter crap. Any melee hunter worth his salt dual wields, because a melee hunter is a rogue hybrid.<br /><br />Yes it's a nice weapon for ANYONE who can use it, but until everyone else has it leave it to the primary melee classes who will actually do something with a 70dps slow ass sword.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My hunter is dual wield simply for 2 X +15 agil enchants which alone makes this a lesser hunter weapon. <br /><br /> Dual bone slicing hatchets + agil enchants equal +56 agil total. Arguably a LOT easier to get than this sword. Its not hard to choose.<br /><br /> Added: This is one of the coolest looking blades out there tho :) My warrior will be wanting this bad when it get to the point he actually has a slim chance of getting it. Itll cost a crapload of points too.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Aug 17 16:42:39 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>STFU GREEDY HUNTERS!<br /><br />You miss the point of Melee weapons! Melee Weapons are supposed to be used in Melee combat!<br /><br />So this is not a hunter sword at all!<br /><br />It's either Shaman or Paladin.<br /><br />I'm a Paladin on the Server Tichondrius and got it on our first Razorgore Kill.<br /><br />At first the Warriors wanted this weapon too. Jesus. They cried me a river as i rolled on it and won.<br /><br />Took ages to convince em to learn their class and get a one hand weapn + shield to wield !<br /><br />Other classes then Paladin and Shamans rolling on this Weapon are just bloody greedy noobs who still need to learn how to play the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dont understand... <br /><br />if ive understood everything correctly, hunters have their main source of DPS in ranged combat, so it would be logic for them to wield weapons which would boost ranged damage. As a 60 warrior ive learned that if i hit a hunter in melee, he will use every skill avaliable to get away from me so he can use his ranged weapons. <br /><br />Im using the Unstoppable force and i can guarantee that if i met a Hunter who had this weapon in melee.. plain melee.. i would litteraly crush him.. so why would a hunter want this as it doesnt boost ranged damage and i allready explained earlier that a hunter in melee is a dead hunter.<br /><br />Am i wrong?<br />educate me why a hunter would want this.. and not weapons which boost ranged dmg.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there is very little words on this world that can describe how i want this weapon... even for the looks of it :D<br /><br />any hunter that believes he will ever possess one (without being ignored by half of his server) is a comblete retard. if u had this and a warrior had it too, he would just one-hit you with it, laugh, spit on you and camp your corpse for the next 5 hrs for the fun of it.</div>

A paladin can get this as the guild will get better weapons later on. And there are a lot of the warriors in guild are prot. not many MS warriors in my as that is more PvP then PvE. And we all know that BWL is a hard PvE place so there are not ppl with PvP gear on. I and know that there ofc is some warriors that use 2-H. But all in the guild hope we clear BWL at a point so they set they eyes on other weapon's. And if there is a warrior that need a good 2-H I think most paladin's would pass and let him get it.. I know that I would have passed if a warrior in the raid have asked for it too, but I had no epic weapon at the time and they all had epic weapon so they give it to me... <br /><br />Edited, Tue Oct 18 21:36:23 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't see why a paladin would even want this, it does not work at all with reckoning which is the true pvp damage spec. You have to save 5 charges and then you drop them in 1 big bomb, which means you won't get the buff for the bomb, and after you drop it the buff won't do anything since paladin auto attacking is pretty sad and you need to charge another bomb which will take more than 8 seconds.<br /><br />lv60 paladin<br />lv60 warrior(got spinal reaper, not jealous<br /><br />gnomes look really bad with big swords, I saw one with ashkandi and just laughed.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't want to start @#$%, but this, just for the 300 strength proc, should be prioritized to warriors and paladins before hunters. There are 1h's that have this much agility.</div>

If i blastershot drops i wouldn't roll on it because it has some strength (i think) and a +1 chance to crit. The first class this should go to is warrior, then if your alliance, paladin, then hunter. Hunter's don't melee, and dont come to me and say they do, because if you say they do you can come &quot;melee&quot; against me and have your ass serverly beeten several times over, even if your in all giantstalker or dragonstalker... whatever it is</div>

I'm a lvl 60 hunter and yes I do melee but for crying out loud to all you dumbass hunters, please stick to what you do best, range attack and stop talking about this melee hunter bull@#$%, I also have a lvl 60 warrior and I OWN any hunter that attemps to melee me ( Arcanite Reaper 31% chance to crit = hunter dead in 6 swings or less FTW) &gt;&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The proc isn't guaranteed to go off in every fight, perhaps 2 out of 3 and it hasn't happened twice in the same battle for me.<br /><br />I could be wrong but i believe that this sword is the best thing that can happen to a warrior. We rely on burst damage to own in PvP which means:<br />1--be in melee range<br />2--get a good crit off MS, Bloodthirst, whatever -essentially get lucky<br /><br />Sword-spec is the most luck-based spec of them all, i mean 5% chance for a second attack is something no man should rely on but that's what we get. The Untamed is the most luck-based weapon of them all so it fits nicely with the sword-spec.<br />To see Untamed Fury, Holy Strength and Enrage open at the same time isn't a rare thing, that amounts to +800 attack power and +25% damage. If you get a second attack and at least one crit on top of that then...no comment (hasn't happened to me yet)<br /><br />This is it then, the most insane burst damage in the game and all of it luck-based in the extreme.<br /><br />I still prefer axe-spec and Spinal Reaper tho :)<br /><br />Hunters who want this for the +22 Agi? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHHA<br /><br />&lt;whatever class&gt; who want this because they pay money and they can equip it?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Whoever said every weapon is a Hunter weapon you are right in a sense. You dont see many Hunters running around with staves, in this case this sword may not be the ideal hunter weap but it can certainly be useful, if i come accross it im rolling on it. Screw whatever warrior cries about it, hunter has every right to roll on this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OrlocWarrior, you claim to be 20+ but you talk and act like a 12 year old who just got to 60 and wants to play with the big kids.<br /><br />While there are no Melee Hunters, there are Hunters who Melee. I am a Hunter who frequently uses Raptor Strike, Wing Clip (improved), and Counterattack to fight toe to toe with my opponents. In the event that I ever need to finish off my opponent, especially in Warsong Gulch, or while fighting a lootable monster, I almost always run up to them and finish them off so I am able to quickly loot and continue to the next player or mob.<br /><br />Granted I would never spend my DKP on this if there were Warriors who wanted it, it would still be the best possible epic 2 handed weapon for a Hunter to use were he to be faced with a melee fighter that he can not keep away from.<br /><br />Let's say I'm jumped by a rogue with this sword, now with my crit chance as high as it is, I'm faced with only one choice- Melee the Rogue until I manage to trigger a good Counterattack to give me time to run to range. If I don't manage to parry an attack, a weapon like this would make up for it, as I could easily get plenty of Raptor Strike or even normal hit crits out and the rogue would be as good as dead.<br /><br />With a speed like this weapon's, I'd love to see a Hunter proudly weilding it one day. It probably won't be me, of course.<br /><br />Besides, I think the sword is ass-ugly</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><i>What is the most important stat for a Warrior?</i><br />STRENGTH.<br /><br />Read the proc (which players say goes off fairly often). Warriors don't use bows or guns, as they are constantly swinging. Hunters are using their bows and guns more often than meleeing, so the proc is getting it's full use out of it since the Hunter isn't always meleeing.<br /><br />Not to mention, once again, Strength is the most important stat for a warrior. <i>Hunters who think they should have an equal chance at this weapon, tell me what weapon in the game can give more strength than this?</i><br /><br />Hunters are better off dual wielding with +agility on both weapons anyways.<br /><br /><b>Look at the characters that actually have this weapon. They are all Warriors and some Paladins, that should tell you something.</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, lets clear somethings up. If u look at the stats on this weapon, the class it would benefit most are warriors, plain and simple. Paly's that want to dps and want it, thats fine, but u aint touchin it till every warr in the guild is wielding one first, thats how we roll. The Herald of Woe is the best Paly weapon other than the Sulfuron in the game, so if a warr wanted a Herald of Woe, well he'd have to wait until no other paly's wanted to look at it. Thats how it should be, palys cant do everything as well as warrs cuz id love to see a raid grp go in and fight Nef with no warrs and see how much they hold agg, and if u gonna post and say i seen it or did it, link the frikkin video. Now as far as calculations go TUB gives u 300 to STR. for warrs thats 600 AP! Add Crusader and you got another 200 AP. So it definetly would help the warriors out (no matter the spec). And this thing about a def spec getting it, so what if they do. Its not like they cant respec after it drops, i know ive done it b4 for certian weapons. Bottom line is you can all complain about how much u pay a month and what u deserve to roll on (rolling in the first place is upsurd to me for 40-mans, dkp all the way) but when you join a guild you agree to certain rules and regulations, and only an idiot would join a guild not knowing what those are. So, if you dont like the way the guild does business, go grab some tissue for those tears and find another one.<br /><br />Id like to close with a saying:<br /><br />&quot;The Untamed Blade, others may wield it, but only warriors can master it...&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Of course, dps warriors will get most use from this weapon. I am a paladin and if my guild's dps warriors need it, I wouldn't mind pass it until every one of them has it (for the benefit of the guild and PvE raid).<br /><br />However, the proc of this weapon is more of the paladin &quot;Seal of Command&quot; style. From my experience, the proc rate of this weapon is quite equivalent to the proc rate of Seal of Command. And since it has been confirmed that the Crusader enchant stacks with this weapon's proc, I think that if Untamed Fury/Seal of Command/Crusader happen all at the same time the damage will be very considerable.<br /><br />For hunters with this weapon, I personally have no comment. I am not arguing that this weapon should not belong to a hunter, but if a warrior (regarless if he/she is MS/Fury) or a full retribution paladin wants to have it, they should have it. It will benefit them both in the long run.<br /><br />Otherwise, any class that can wield this weapon can have it; it is only a PvP toy anyway.</div>

You're better off getting the Spear and saving your DKP (If your guild uses DKP) for Giant/Dragonstalker or that new epic Crossbow from Chromaggus.

It might be a little upsetting to some to hear this, so sit down and get yur teddy ready for a cuddle, but many Ferrari owners dont even break the speed limit, but they still allowed to buy one ;) they dont just restrict it to racing drivers.<br /><br />I feckin h8 all the crap about &quot;it's a such n such weapon&quot; go get a life, If it truly was class specific, Blizz would it add it to the description, but they havent.<br /><br />Besides which we all know &quot;it's a Hunter weapon&quot; ok ok im jokin, but seriously, my main alt is a lvl 60 Hunter, and I have used 2h swords from the beginning, cause I like em (they do it for me)so some smart arse tellin me no it's not for u can sod off, I been playin mmorpg's since Diablo, some spotty geek who has number crunched his decision about whether I can have it or not can go train spot, cause if it comes up, I'll be expecting as fair a chance on it as anyone in the party including Warriors &amp; Paladins, besides look at the drop rate 9.? % there is enough for everyone!</div>
