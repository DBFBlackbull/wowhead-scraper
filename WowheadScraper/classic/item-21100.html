I found all the Elders with the exception of the Strathlome, Blackrock Depths and Blackrock Spire Elders.&nbsp; Strath and Blackrock Spire, I did not even try to attempt.&nbsp; Blackrock Depth I tried and failed seven times, although I got closer each time to the Ring of Law.&nbsp; Overall ... I had fun!&nbsp; Over 5 bars of experience <i>(approx)</i> for discovering new areas on the map and I also enjoyed seeing zones/instances for the very first time.&nbsp; The most fun I had was sneaking into Ally cities.<br /><br />Arthas Lvl 49 Rogue <br />~ Nightgoddess ~</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I got them all for rep (I wanna raptor :D) and can confirm they are all soloable. I have to say I liked this quest its been fun lol<br /><br />Only tricky ones were Strat which needed a ss and 1 swiftness potion. Brs was the hardest i used a ss and 1 invisibility potion AND sacrificed my voidwalker. Infact it wasnt that hard but took a few attempts to get the combination right.<br /><br />The ally ones were great fun but only place I died was in stormwind not long after getting in, then used ss drank swiftness potion quick and got all the way to the park. Infact I spoke to elder killed the one guard after me and found myself sitting there with nothing to do except wave at a few lowbies :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to confirm for this year:<br /><br />Once again it has been confirmed by Blizzard that there are NO rewards for all 50 coins. For those who dont know, there was a rumor that if you collected all 50 coins from the Elders, you could pick one of four epic trinkets. In both 2006 and 2007, this has been confirmed <b>false.</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First off, just a warning. I went around and got almost all of these tokens so I could get the fireworks recipes for my lower level engineer. Well that is a waste of time because the fireworks recipes are soulbound. The launchers are not but the fireworks recipes themselves are. So....I sold those to an NPC dirt cheap and set out on my little engineer. I went to all the easiest places I could get to with no flight paths and got 5 tokens together.<br /><br />Now when I get to Moonglade the npc who gives the recipes, Fariel Starsong, will not talk to me or offer me anything. *Cries*<br /><br />SO, does anyone know why I am unable to get the fireworks recipes now? I am level 11, does that have anything to do with it?</div>

He's gnomish and likely hit these same ones last year. The NElf ones did give me the coins in Darnassus, Darkshore, Astranaar and Dolanaar.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Alliance and Horde can pick up coins from Elders in opposing areas, you just have to watch out for surrounding NPCs, guards and in the case of main cities, players. The Elders will still be friendly to you, though. Each coin picked up gives 50 reputation points to ALL of the main Alliance or Horde factions, depending on which one you are. So if you get all 50 coins, that's a cool 2500 reputation for each of your main factions :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've found damn near every coin, since I'm an engineer and I wanted all the firework schematics. They're almost useless, really, but fun, so that's really the point. :) I was grabbing all the ones on Kalimdor I could find first, since I started with Darnassus and worked my way south. Had no trouble getting any of 'em, even in the Horde-controlled towns (though not TB or Org yet), until I got to Maraudon.<br /><br />To go for this coin, you need a healthy dose of masochism, lots of time, and a total lack of sanity. Unless you're a high-level rogue or druid, you WILL need a group that's willing to go to the VERY END. Yes, the very freaking end of the bloody instance. And it's a LONG instance, too. Whatever you do, do NOT fall/jump off of the bridge over the gigantic pond with the honking big crocolisk in it. Not only will you die a bloody and mangled death, you're gonna hafta run ALLLLLL the way back, avoiding respawns and the like, since you're too far away for the priest to rez your ass. And if you stealthed, well, you're doubly screwed. Go across the bridge and into the next room, and the light-dude is standing in there somewhere. SO...MUCH...HATE... Sneaking the ones out of Orgimmar and Thunder Bluff will take less time, hurt less, and be far more entertaining than Maru. Now 'scuse me as I huddle in the corner in a fetal position and whimper as I relive my THREE trips through there, thanks to two accidental deaths. *Shudder...*</div>

Quickest way was to go through backdoor, rush left (pray you don't get dazed), through the gate, take a right and you should see the Elder just before the Unforsaken boss.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TerribleAtGames</b></h3>As a <a href="/classic/race=3/dwarf">Dwarf</a> healing <a href="/classic/class=5/priest">Priest</a> I was surprised of how easier it is for Alliance on PvE-server to obtain all 50 <a href="/classic/item=21100/coin-of-ancestry">Coin of Ancestry</a> than it is for Horde, and all due to how fortified Ironforge and Stormwind are compared to the horde capitals. On this lvl 60 character I spoke with all elders.<br /><br /><b>Undercity?</b><br />Surprisingly not a single guard on my way in. Straight in, and left doorway. Not a single Horde bothered by my presence.<br /><br /><b>Freewind Post?</b><br />Heavily guarded. From what I observed from the top of the lift, I would be beaten to death as soon as I stepped forward. Big was the surprise when the Horde guards didn't cared about my presence at all. I must only assume that the Freewind guards are set to tolerate non-aggressive Alliance players during the Lunar festival.<br /><br /><b>Thunder Bluff?</b><br />Use the northern/back yard lifts. When up, dodge/avoid guards while heading eastwards over the bridge to the eastern 'isle'. <a href="/classic/spell=10901/power-word-shield">Power Word: Shield</a> and <a href="/classic/spell=10942/fade">Fade</a> with <a href="/classic/spell=10890/psychic-scream">Psychic Scream</a> as last resort.Got my <a href="/classic/item=21100/coin-of-ancestry">Coin of Ancestry</a> before I died. And again, no Horde players ganking an easy target.<br /><br /><b>Orgrimmar?</b><br />Western entrance. Plenty of guards to dodge on my way eastwards, but still miraculously none managed to knock me of my mount until I got past The Valley of Strength. Using the same strategy as in Thunder Bluff, and I obtained my fifth coin before being gangraped by <a href="/classic/race=2/orc">Orc</a> guards. And again, no interference from Horde players.<br /><br />I really must applaud the Horde's sense of fairness and understanding of my errand.<br /><br />Back home to Ironforge, and an unfortunate Horde is detected. Immediate gankfest, while I do my best to tell eveyone to let Hordes coming for their <a href="/classic/item=21100/coin-of-ancestry">Coin of Ancestry</a> to do their business in the same way we Alliance can obtain our coins in the Horde capitals.<br /><br />And to all ganked coin-collecting Horde players: I sincerely apologise for my fellow Alliance-players premature behaviour</div>
