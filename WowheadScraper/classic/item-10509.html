<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i simply can't believe the drop rates quoted here, perhaps they have changed since the data was compiled. i just had to kill nearly 80 elementals and i still need one more heart! still its almost taken me to level 47 :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got all 4 hearts in little less that a hour around Kalaran Windblade ..4 lava pits one up on hill at 42.34 drop 3/4 . Blazing Elem's</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have killed both types of elementals about a toatal of 200 of them died a bit too. and have only found 1! should be updated to 1%&gt; chance of drop</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it wasnt that hard.. got all under 10 min</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In order to get the Heart of Flame to drop you have to kill the elemental <b>inside a pool of lava!</b>. You can even pull them into one, just as long as you kill them while standing in the lava. Hope this helps...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got one from a 47 Blazing Elemental fought totally on land, about as far from lava as these things roam.&nbsp; I fought several in lava first and got nothing.&nbsp; It doesn't matter where you fight them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to where Thottbot data says they're the densest - in the bottom of the Cauldron.<br /><br />Not one Heart of Flame dropped. However, 2 Heart of Fire dropped, so I guess that's worth something.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>From 1.10 patch notes:<br /><br />&quot;- Magma Elementals in the Searing Gorge can now drop the Heart of Flame quest item.&quot;<br /><br />Woot?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can confirm two points:<br /><br />The Rock Elementals (Magma Elemental) Drop the Heart of Flame<br /><br />The Lava is the key - The Magma Elemental that Dropped a Heart of Flame for me was in lava.<br /><br />oh..&nbsp; and I was in the pit for all four drops<br /><br />Hope this helps...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I know things like this don't usually matter in WoW, but my drop rate was 100% (4 of 4) when the elemental was in the lava and 0% (0 of about 20) when it wasn't.<br /><br />I'm not saying they only drop in lava, just sharing my experience.<br /><br />Good Luck.&nbsp; Btw, a bunch can be found in the pit around 58,44.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is really hard for a fire mage, they resist most of the spells damage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just finished this quest, and I figured I'd give out a few tips...<br /><br />-All of the elementals I killed that dropped it started the fight in a lava pool, but were pulled out of it and died on normal ground.<br />-Only fire elementals dropped it for me, none of the rock ones did.<br /><br />Also, this quest really isn't that bad for fire mages.&nbsp; As long as you stick to only fire elementals, you can kill them no problem; keep Dampen Magic on yourself at all times (reduces all damage taken from the elementals), and cast Fire Ward on yourself right before pulling.&nbsp; From there, it's just a frostbolt pull then arcane missile spam - the fire ward will absorb everything, and you'll kill the thing before your ward runs out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've killed at least 20 of these things, &amp; only gotten two Hearts of Flame. They do not seem to be a 21-27% drop rate.<br /><br />Edit: Right after posting this, I killed two blazing elementals down inside the Cauldron itself, &amp; got two Hearts of Flame. I think it's probably better to go down into the Cauldron, as the elementals spawn more frequently down there, &amp; seem to drop the Hearts more often.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Apr 18 12:20:54 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>After I went down into the cauldron itself, I was able to get all four of the hearts of flame in about 30 minutes. But right after you go down into the cauldron, just beware that there are 3 walking humanoids in a group, 2 slavers and a taskmaster I think it is. About 45-48 that wander that area constantly where the hearts of flame drop.<br /><br />A note, I did this at 51 and got 4400 xp for it.<br /><br />Edited, Mon May 23 00:09:37 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been killing both Blazing and Inferno Elementals for the past two days and I haven't gotten a single one.<br /><br />I've gotten Coal, Heart of Fire, Elemental Fire, and the random green, but not a single Heart of Flame.<br /><br />The Golem Oils for the quest dropped off virtually every Golem and Magme Elemental, but I just can't get these Hearts of Flame.<br /><br />It doesn't help that these elementals aren't very common in the first place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>AS of 11/5/05 they do drop. the rate is nowhere near 25% thought. More like 10%</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am wondering if it is still working, not getting any hearts of flame, have gotten 14 hearts of fire. I have been hacking these elementals up for 4 hours over 2 days got tones of oil but no hearts of flame. I am about to give up and go try something else getting very bored killing these guys. This site lists the drops at about 20% from the blazing and inferno elementals. Using those statistics I should have gotten at least 1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Go for 39,47 . Nice drop rate killed 7 dropped the 4 .. in caulderon lava areas .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i had to kill 26 of the inferno elementals with the supposed 25% drop chance before i got one of these items. Real pain to get.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The elementals spawn on the lava but sometimes they spawn as the rock elementals so u might have to kill a few to get the fire elementals spawn in their place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this drop is like 0.00000000000000001 % killed liek hundereds and havent got ^&amp;*! but crap i dont want</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you go into the cauldron and kill them there, much higher drop rate than next to the quest giver. I got 4 in 4 kills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this quest and had an amazing 3 drop almost in a row. I'm now back for the third time trying to get the fourth to drop. I clear the entire chasm, from the ramp to the scaffolding, even killing the magmas in hope that a burning will spawn in their place. <br /><br />Very frustrating. If I didn't have rest experience (I'm getting from 350-480 xp per kill) I'd probably drop this quest -- although, I think it goes on a bit more, so I'll probably stick with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I didn't have a problem with this. I had about a 50% drop rate, couldn't have killed more than 8 or so to get all 4 hearts and 5 or 6 golems for the oils. I believe I got 3 of the 4 from Magma Elementals, and only one from the blazing, but the magma ones were more abundant so the drop rate may be the same for both, not as low as is posted above.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Mar 18th 2007 3:15am by Caleryn</i></div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
