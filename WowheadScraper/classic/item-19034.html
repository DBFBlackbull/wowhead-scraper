<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found it at 83 41 on that little island!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>when you open the basket it's empty. All that happens is thet it spawns three lvl 49 trolls. The first one you loot of them will carry the lunch, they don't drop anything else. I was able to solo them on level 48 with a druid, but if you want to be certain (since it was pretty close for me) to bring them down in one go you might want to bring someone with you</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Level 47 warlock... easy. DoT two of them and chain fear the 3rd, your warlock should be able to hold the two aggros w/o any trouble.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I soloed this quest being a 50 lock. Killed my VW and had to use one potion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just used FD as a hunter. hit it quick. no problems.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, I opened the basket and killed the three trolls, but it still says Lard's Lunch 0/1. How do i get the lunch and finish?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went after the basket again after killing trolls. Big mistake. The lunch is a drop on the trolls. Dont touch the basket again or they respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>46 priest completed.&nbsp; Just, vamp embrace, dot, Mindblast one right off the bat.&nbsp; Fear them all and killed just one.&nbsp; Looted him real fast, he had the lunch on him.&nbsp; Then let the other two kill me.&nbsp; Took a death but completed it simple as pie.&nbsp; I guess I got lucky with it being the first one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Done this as a lv45 BM hunter, put a freeze trap down before opening. Pet on one of them, one on me, and one in trap (and later also on me). Unloaded on the mob tanked by pet, then let pet aggro the other two. Looted and ran off. Didn't even need a pot, and pet didn't die either (poofed when I got out of range).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lvl45 Shaman - didn't know about the 3 things that popped up so I shat myself... frostshocked one, jumped in water - water walking on.... earthbind totem down...<br /><br />2 of em gave up at that point but the one I shocked came after me and I took that one out to get the lunch :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i solod it with my 46 hunter sent pet after one other 2 came after me n i used feign death and 2 left me and pet alone so me n pet ganged up on the 1....pretty easy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just did it as a barley 47 druid.&nbsp; 3 came up, went bear form.&nbsp; Roared n mauled.&nbsp; Let my rage build up, when i was at 1/4 I frenzied killed 1, looted got the lunch, then changed back, warstomped, healed, bearform killed a 2nd one . . .<br /><br />Really not hard.&nbsp; Thats why its *yellow* when you're 47.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>for us hunters ( woop ) we have it easy. put ur pet on passiv and when the 3 mobs come use feignt death then jst kill 1 of them when they go bk to the 3 corners on that little island and that 1 mob should drop it so as u c its not vry hard to do ( well for me XD )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stealthed as soon as it opened, cheap shotted the first one, slice n' diced, blinded the 3rd and blade flurried/adrenaline rushed the other two with evasion on, used a thistle tea but was possible at 46 combat swords. Berserking helped a bit. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've done it while i'm 46lvl hunter, i do it all alone, it was hard but you must kill 1 of them and loot him after your death. I died 3 times thank God my pet was do excellent work taking the agro of one of them and with Fake death i've done it.<br />Don't do it all alone before 48lvl</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Seriously, the ppl who said its not soloable as a rogue is stupid.. evasion, blade flurry and adrenaline rush and all 3 mobs are down before the cds runs out. so l2p stupi dnoobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just killd one, looted him and ran...very simple yet very effective...<br /><br />Rayau<br />49 UD Shadow Priest<br />Darkspear</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I soloed with my lvl 47 Hunter. Quite easy, fake death and they aggro my pet. Then with the help of some traps and stuff i was duable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finished this on a level 48 druid. Looted, popped into bear form before they came, popped frenzied regeneration and slowly took one down, then looted it, jumped intot he water, and cast water form to escape the other two. Was at about 50% health when I finished.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They appear to have lower health then normal mobs of the same level. Done easily by 46 BE Paladin. I just JoCru'd the first one and then SoCom'd him dead, looted,divine shielded and then repented one and HoJ'd the other, ran them off and made it home in time for dinner ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah I stumbled across this while I was on the turtle snapshot quest and thought it looked pretty neat.&nbsp; I had no idea what would happen if I grabbed it.&nbsp; Out jump the trolls, shouting something like &quot;Another fool falls for the trap!&quot;&nbsp; I just ran to the water and shifted quick to aquatic form and ran like &amp;^$@.&nbsp; They chased me until I was within an inch of life, but I got away.&nbsp; If there were any aggro mobs out in the water I would've been dead :P<br /><br />...just in case y'all were getting tired of the &quot;no sweat, I soloed this as a lvl 45 (insert twink here)&quot; stories : ))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a lv47 shammy,for this quest is very easy for shammy, make sure you take the ankh with you, and then you just use all the things to kill one of them, dunt worry if they kill you, coz you have the ankh, just waitting for them to go away, then rez, then loot, then hand in quest~!easy~!haha~!Shammy~!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>idk how a hunter with a pet lower than 45 did this, sure it should be easy, focus fire one, NP, cept my pet's growl got resisted EVERY SINGLE TIME. not to mention they dodge all my Wingclips, and don't bellieve my FD, im gonna try one more time and then call it quits til my pet dings a few more times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Gnomish Deathray ftw~</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just solo'ed with a 45 BE pally on second attempt. Used 1 superior healing pot, 1 heavy stone statue, healed myself with holy light twice. Didn't need to shield, although in hindsight I should have. Once the basket was opened, I hit the first troll with a judgement. I then jumped off the island and kept backing off. (Very important if you do it this way to not hit the other two with anything). The two other trolls lost aggro after a bit and I was left with the single to deal with. Fortunately for me, it dropped the lunch. Can't say if it dropped because it was the only troll left, or if I got lucky, but hey, I ain't complaining.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lol who said he did it with 46 hunter and that it was hard? I soloed this with my 44 hunter and it was a piece of cake just freeze trap one and hold the other 2 with the pet then just simply kill on of them loot him take the item and run simply doing it without a scratch</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>unless you explain the tactics used, you are just wanking if you claim you soloed this or any other quest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>located just NE from the waterfall on the coast of the hinterlands. be warned, after clicking the basket, three mobs will come at you. one of the three will drop lard's lunch.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jun 8 14:31:10 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>as a 47 shammy, I tried a few things. The only tactic that worked was to open the basket, spawn the 3 mobs, then throw everything I had at one of these mobs, put it down and loot the lunch fast from the corpse fast before the two others killed me. Went back to retrieve body - no mobs present - went back to Revantusk and cashed it in. 4550 xp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LoreMooster</b></h3>Solo'd this as a 50 warrior. Opened the lunch, burned down the first mob to appear, looted Lard's Lunch off the body, burned the others for a bit then used Intimidating Shout and ran out of there. Could have killed them all if I had a health potion. They have high resist, so use Piercing Howl or Hamstring to get away safely.</div>
