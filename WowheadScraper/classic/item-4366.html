Just drop them, let them die and loot it. It is about a 15% chance on a Fused Wiring from my experiences.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6998</b></h3>These are also great for taking on multiple mobs or elite quests. I've had great experiences with target dummies while duo'ing stockades as two pallies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maed</b></h3>To extend on what Falcore said, this is a very good way to get Fused Wiring, but be prepared to wait the cooldown of two minutes every time used. To help speed up the process try getting some friends or guild mates to help you out, as one of my friends did. Going through 200 of these is not too much fun. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9250</b></h3>In my experience, the drop rate of fused wiring on the cheap dummies is not different from the drop rate of the expensive ones, so this is the best thing to make if you're looking for wiring.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I finally had the cool down bug.&nbsp; It was because I was unable to loot the target dummy and it remained on the ground, therefore not initiating the cool down.&nbsp; After about 30 minutes, the target dummy remains, and its loot-ables, disappeared and restarted the countdown.&nbsp; The quickest way to solve this is to do what was said and log out. <br /><br />GM Petitioned.<br /><br />Also, the loot table of these might have been altered.&nbsp; I went though 25 of these before I hit a fused wiring.&nbsp; Might just have been a bad streek though.</div>
