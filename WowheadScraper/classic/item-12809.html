One week, you can farm 10 of them and sell them for 200g, the next week, you farm 10 and you sell them for 50g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>21874</b></h3>Farming these, as of the latest patch (2.0.12), is a pain. Either the drop rate has been dramatically decreased below Wowhead's ~18.9% drop rate or I am just unlucky. It took me 60 kills to get 1 stone and the elites that drop it are not a common mob that can be easily farmed back to back.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>25211</b></h3>I'd just like to share that farming 8 of these for my dodge enchant as a lvl 70 prot warrior took me 74 minutes (timed). So have fun! &gt;_&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can solo with no problem..<br /><br />I have a 60 hunter on silvermoon..<br /><br />Don't have beastalker or anything, best item is gorewood lol..just feign death if I cause too much aggro, heal my pet and pwn him..&nbsp; Frost trap behind you if ya get into trouble..and Bandage..<br /><br />Depends on the battle but I usually don't even let him kill my pet..&nbsp; But if he gets down to like 15% life w/ my pet killed I can melee solo..<br /><br />Just tips for Hunters</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got my cloak yesterday. These are piss easy as a druid. I am resto but I have a full feral set for soloing. Strategy: starfire, then root, then moonfire, starfire, root again, moonfire, faerie fire (bah, I know), dire bear (at 9k armour and 5k hp with my feral set), dem. roar, leave the rage for frenzied regen. If I get low on health bash, caster form, nature's swiftness, rank 10 healing touch, back to bear. Estimated time: 2 minutes tops. I am actually now farming these for muni and drops (stones sell good, cash drop is nice, even got an eternium lockbox a couple of days ago). And I can get my herbs while I look for these bastards. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Based on the comments by other Hunters, some about kiting, silly things like Wing Clip, excessive use of Auto Shot, blah blah, I think the way I kill these things takes a little over thirty seconds, and leaves me usually at full Health with my Pet at about 25%.&nbsp; First, find one, now move in back of it so that it's walking away from you, lay a Freezing Trap, then Aimed Shot just a moment before it gets out of range, as soon as the Shot hits follow it up with a Concussive Shot, then Multi-Shot, then Auto Shot until it gets too close, if you time it right, you can usually get off an Arcane Shot before it closes in on you.&nbsp; Now back away, and let it get caught in your Freezing Trap.&nbsp; Now, run backwards to Max Range, and repeat the steps, Aimed Shot, Concussive Shot, Multi-Shot, Auto Shot then Arcane Shot, except this time, after your Aimed Shot, send your Pet to attack.&nbsp; Now when the Guardian gets close, give it a Raptor Strike then Feign Death.&nbsp; It should now be on your Pet.&nbsp; Now back up to any Range, and begin Auto Shot and spamming your other Shots, usually it's down to about 40% by the time it even gets to attack me.&nbsp; If you see your Pet getting low on Health, call it back and use a Concussive Shot then finish the Guardian off at melee.&nbsp; Again, this whole process takes about 30-40 seconds once you get it down, and leaves you at very little risk.&nbsp; Happy Hunting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm just a 59 fire spec mage and can solo these in less than a min.&nbsp; Just frost nova them and run like hell with blink and cone of cold and other slowing moves until the cooldown on frost nova ends so u can freeze em then bomb them again.&nbsp; If things get outta hand just use a mana ruby, throw up your mana shield, and blink away.&nbsp; They seem to have a very slow move speed so its easy to play keep-away with them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok this is based on an above poster so credit there.<br /><br />I decided to check out the Curse of Doom / Banish strategy and as of patch 1.8 it works.<br /><br />so here goes:<br />You need vw - just for comfort.<br /><br />Send your vw at the guardian<br />Cast curse of doom<br />Cast banish (Rank 2) by calculation you can look at the cooldown for Curse of doom and figure when banish expires. Keep your vw tanking.<br />When first banish expires cast Banish (Rank 1) ASAP.<br />Keep your distane, let vw tank and enjoy the guardian loosing more than 33% of it's health i one hit a few secs after the second banish wears off. At this point just redo until it's dead. should take 3 banishes and no sweat. you can heal the vw if needed while the guardian is banished.<br /><br />Another note: if fighting one guardian, and another passes by, it does not aggro. good to know there's no reason to run or panic :D<br /><br />2 kills so far no stone - i'll go on - guess i can make a fortune on ah xD<br /><br />Edit: small update now up to 15 kills, 3 stones seems the droprate at around 20% - 1 pr 5 kills is correct. also had a thorium lockbox and a travelers backpack drop from these guys :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everyone brags around about how easy they find these mobs to kill, well if thottbot where a forum for kill tactics you whould be at the right place, but it isn't.<br /><br />For everyone elso who doesn't know how to find these guys: they are in Un'Goro Crater, they are lvl 60-61 Elite, neutral to everyone and can be found almost everywhere in the crater. Not very hard to spot, 'cause they're the only golems in Un'Goro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i solo these guys all the time. I take all the damage up front in bear form. idk i couldnt stand rooting, dotting, and starfire strategy. i go until i have 1/4 health, enrage and frenzied regen. when thats done i wait til i have a little health left and bash. during bash, i root em in place and heal and the go back to bear formin em. if they resist bash, i activate natures grasp adn hes instantly rooted so i can heal. these guys are the eziest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They are not hard to kill at all for a druid with decent gear.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I kill these in like 15 seconds as frost mage. now its just as fast if not faster with the water elemental. frostbolt, frostbolt, fireblast, frost nova if not procc'd, coc (let him hit you if you have the elemental) and if not, blink and finish it off.<br /><br />Literally seconds. =) Love mage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>for feral druids, these guys can be easily soloed without using bear form or even the long and boring root, starfire spam trick. just go up behind them and slap on a regrowth spell. Switch to cat form, stealth, use pounce on him and follow it up with shred and then just dps him. If you have decent gear you should be able to take off at least 1/3 of his health before you have to switch out of cat form and cast heals on yourself. Once you have your heals on you, go back to cat form and you should be able to take him down easily from there. As a druid with average gear (full LT. commanders set from pvp) i can kill these guys in about a minute, which makes farming the stones pretty easy :)</div>

After getting multiple epics and a really good shield I decided to go back and try and kill one of these things. As a protection warrior these guys are a joke to fight. They hit me for an average of 160 - 200 damage per swing if and when they can hit me.
