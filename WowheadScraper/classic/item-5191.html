<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1515</b></h3>Edwin VanCleef drops these at a resonable rate; it shouldn't take too long for you to get one of these beauties. For those who don't know, VanCleef is in the Deadmines, which is an Alliance instance (sorry Horde, maybe next time).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6984</b></h3>The sword is also great for warriors and other melee classes. It's not hard to get, and you don't have to be twinked to get this. You will also receive a choice of 3 blues afterwards from killing Vancleef as a quest.<br />Deadmines is at Moonbrook, a small village in southern Westfall. You will need about 5 lvl 18+ to run the instance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7293</b></h3>This one and Wingblade from the Wailing Cavern quest reward (and that IS Horde only) are very nice for a twink. Or then just Dual wield these if you want.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skitzosmeagol</b></h3>This is the most commonly seen twink weapon in the 19 bracket :) Its mods are amazing and its DPS amazing. With dual wielding these with some enchants tossed on it is a deadly combo. It drops of Van Cleef, who is on a giant ship surrounded by alot of people and also escorted by a few body guards.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7735</b></h3>Amazing sword for the level. As was mentioned, it is terrific for warrior and rogue twinks, especially considering that unlike the wingblade, it can be aquired by horde and alliance alike, albeit it can be difficult to get to deadmines on a horde character.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Rogue weapon only. Anyone who tries to get this who is not a 19 twink rogue( or maybe war or pala) is an idiot. It took me 30 runs to get this and blackened defias armour from VC on my 19 twink. If your planning on passing 19 then this is a waste of time. In the time it took me to get this(having a 62 mage run me through) anyone could easily grind from lvl 20-32. You will replace this sword to easily at 30 and using some green is way faster training.<br /><br />Btw rhe reason i said rogue only weapon, is because hunters cant Duel wield at 19....Most hunter twinks use twisted chanters staff, and a sword and shield isnt much fun for a warrior twink.<br /><br />My point is if you dont plan on twinking dont waste your time. Vc gives nearly no xp at 23 + and its just a waste. Stop carring about blues at a low lvl. You will replace them to easily.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The only defias leather worth wearing is the blackened defias chest. There are much better blues and greens available. Do some research with the advanced item search and open a whole new world to your view. <br /><br />And duel wielding cruel barbs with lifesteal and crusader are about as good as it gets for rogues. Do some careful analysis of what talent spec you can make use of--and yes, using a dagger has its advantages depending on what you want to do, so cruel barb may not be everyone's wet dream.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I suppose that I'm really lucky to have gotten this today, especially seeing all the sad stories on here, and that this was my first time running VC. The group I was with was absolutely fantastic, and the roll for the Cruel Barb was really close, with something like 4 out of 5 group members rolled, and everyone was in the high 70's to 80's on the roll. I won with an 87, yet nobody complained, seeing as how I'd only won about two other rolls in the entire run. I was kinda sad though, because I was wanting the Blackened Defias Armor, but oh well...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This sword is awesome! I LOVE IT! Unfortunatly, it took me forever to get it. I had to get two level 60's to escort me through the Deadmines, but when I got it, it was quite helpful!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farmed dm today with my rogue. In about 10 runs this dropped three times and the armor dropped twice. Dual wielding two of these... It kicks ass I tell ya</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Here's my sob story so far:<br /><br />Have now done about 15-20 runs for cruel barb since turning lvl 18. Didn't get one to drop for the longest time, then had one drop in three consecutive runs. Got outrolled by a hunter, a pally, and a 16 rogue. I never rolled less than 80. Both the hunter and the pally waited until the last second to roll need and then promptly left group and stoned out while i fumed (made it clear ahead of times in all groups that I would roll need ONLY for the barb and for nothing else, and everyone said they wouldn't roll against me).<br /><br />Since I haven't had anyone run me through, just doing pick-up groups got me xp as i kept running it, and now i'm approaching lvl 26. It won't be long before it's not even good enough for me. Just rotten luck i guess.<br /><br />Looking back I probably should've had one of my buddy's 60's run me through until it dropped. That way I wouldn't get it ripped off from me, and i would still be of a lvl to make use of it. I was hoping to earn it though, silly me.</div>

The blackened defias armor was dropped, but i ensured my team that they DIDNT TOOK IT, but what are you gonna do, a ninja took it and he said sorry i will give it back, he tryed then he understood how mad i was.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>heres wat happened 2 me:<br /><br /> I first had a 60 friend run me thru over 50 times for this thing. Didn't drop once. So then i decided to do a real run. I went thru it 10 times, and it dropped twice. Ok, first time i clearly stated in the beggining &quot;hey guys, ive done this so many times, cna i get cruel barb if it drops?&quot; and they all agreed they would let me get. At the end it dropped, i rolled need and i was so excited. Then, at the end, the pally rolled need and won, then left the grp. So that was annoying. Second time was even worse. So this run was me (im a rogue), a mage, a lock, a warrior which alrdy had 2 CB's, and a guildee which was a hunter. I toht for sure i would get this time. I rolled need, and then my guildee rolled need, won the roll, and left the guild.<br /> wat really sucks is that i wanted to be a 19 twink, but after all this runnin, i ended up being 20. =/<br /><br />ne ways, thats my story, i was so pissed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Taraezor</b></h3>Yes rogues. This weapon is for YOU.<br /><br />I cannot stress how very very powerful this weapon is for rogues. You <i>must</i> grind Deadmines until it drops.<br /><br />My rogue is at the stage of running Scarlet Monastery Armory. Along the way I have luckily had <a href="/classic/item=7714/hypnotic-blade">Hypnotic Blade</a>, <a href="/classic/item=9453/toxic-revenger">Toxic Revenger</a> and <a href="/classic/item=13024/beazels-basher">Beazel's Basher</a> drop for me. Juggling all four of these excellent weapons and it remains that my Cruel Barb wins every time in terms of the &quot;Damage&quot; stat for my main hand.<br /><br />(The Damage stat is the one you see when you mouse over Melee Attack -&gt; Damage on your character's paper doll )<br /><br />This is because the +12 to Attack Power is quite strong and in my case almost +4% of my base AP. I carry the other weapons with me so I might optimise for situational fights.<br /><br />Sadly, it took me about 20 runs of the second boss in Gnomeregan to secure my Toxic Revenger (mostly solo - easy for rogues) but it did not stand the test of time. My Cruel Barb from VanCleef lives on!</div>
