Azzinoth was a Doomguard commander whom Illidan slew 10,000 years ago. After looting the demon's twin warglaives he trained himself to use them. He has become exceedingly efficient with the weapons.<br /><br />These weapons are famous as GM weapons, and have been linked to in various datamining posts and in various videos taken from illegal servers.<br /><br />They are the only known artifact that might eventually be in the game, and whose stats are known.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Blades_of_Azzinoth" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Blades_of_Azzinoth</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4956</b></h3>GM weapon, spotted on early test servers around patch 1.2. Later datamined by the masses.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Carighan</b></h3>I would be more interested in the looks of these, tbh. I suspect the two blades Illidan wields, OTOH that might be a bit dull as a look.<br /><br />Although then again... Atiesh looks dull too, and still spiff because it is the Atiesh shown in WC3.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7047</b></h3>I've heard that this might be equivalent to the Eye of Rag dropping off of Rag. So, some super rare drop that you'll get off the next end game boss.<br /><br />Hopefully it will look as cool as the stats suggest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7315</b></h3>If they are going to add it as a player weapon they will adjust stats and damage on it, its way too powerful on a level 70 character. Not even 2 handers in BC reach that kind of DPS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7382</b></h3>Aye I agree that they'd nerf the stats, I mean they would have to, that's just crazy DPS &gt;_&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7440</b></h3>Definatly a GM weapon.<br />Anything with that much DPS would annihilate everyone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3471</b></h3>Hmm, I think it would be kind of odd for any player to actually get this in the expansion. I'm sure people aren't going to actually kill him (not unlike Kel'Thuzad). So the only way to get these are if he leaves them behind, but seeing that these are Illidan's main weapons, and he holds on to them all the time, it seems unlikely.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7517</b></h3>I believe these weapons were simply added to the game for GMs to show off, I doubt they'd be added to the game, at least in their current form.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7307</b></h3>This is totaly fake item. No one see it....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9110</b></h3>The funny thing about this weapon is when you combine them they get smaller but when you break them apart they regain their normal size.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>darkrebel08</b></h3>I would like to see this in the game, but as being an artifact it would be smart if blizz makes it very rare to the point where only a few people per server will have them. Just my opinion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10427</b></h3>If only...<br /><br />The resistances would make locks shiver and shake, plus mages would have to do something other than jump and spam arcane explosion in pvp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>18547</b></h3>Not practical, if this weapon did ever exist in the expansion for lvl 70's after a gruling epic quest; it would instantly become PvP/PvE over ballance. You cant put it in the game without totaly ruining the ballance of the game, and blizzard ist going to reballance the entire game, for the cost of one godly weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xukimonde</b></h3>I assume that we will not be seeing Aritfact items attainable by the community.<br /><br />Legendary items, yes, but something that Blizzard has deemed as an artifact is unlikely to ever fall into the hands of the players, regardless of what it's stats are. Even if something like this were indeed implemented, it would likely be &quot;downgraded&quot; to legendary status.<br /><br />There is no need for yet another ridiculous level of item rarity.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>21705</b></h3>If you read the whole items stats you'll notice thats its a one handed sword so you can dual wield with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8748</b></h3>This sword looks AWESOME! i wish i could port myself to lvl 70 and kill Illidan and use it...but i doubt blizz would ever let drop until Illidan dies for the 100th time its gonna be like the rarest drop ever dont even think that u'll get it. id just forget about getting it but just examining it. if it ever does drop tho...then everyone else who doesnt have it...... beware</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>15389</b></h3>you guys are kidding if people had this ingame and only a few people had them what would be the point in continuing the game at all, its so amazing amd i do hope it isnt ingame, think of what it would cause on pvp realms</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>18009</b></h3>MY theory on this weapon:<br /> I'm just guessing here but ill bet that this drops either from Illidan himself during battle, bodyguards/adds that he spawns, or other bosses in Black Temple to use against Illidan and make him possibly beatable... you'll either want to give this to your MT so he maintains aggro easily or to a sword rogue.... but he'll need to hold back quite a bit or he'll pull aggro and be pwnd instantly. none of this is confirmed but i thought about this sword: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22736">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22736</a> from pre-BC and when i saw it in the weapons list on thottbot i had the same reaction as when i saw this one... my jaw dropped to the desk!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>18009</b></h3>Thats what i was trying to say... you can only use this baby in Black Temple against Illidan... if you read the In Development Section @ <a href="https://www.worldofwarcraft.com" rel="nofollow">www.worldofwarcraft.com</a>... it clearly states you will be able to kill Illidan.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>35591</b></h3>This weapon surely a fake... For 1 simple fact, who can dual wield swords?... answer: warrior and rogue... I don't see them need +int for the start... If you guys still think that this sword meant to be hunter, is illidan a hunter? illidan is purely a melee class and dont use any bow or gun.. is he?<br />If someone wanna make a fake illidan sword... please at least consider it to be more realistic... :)<br />Dont ever think that this is a drop sword because it doesn't suit any class that blizzard ever make for this game... I haven't seen a GM wandering in the game using this game also and i dont know how they character played in the game... but the question is... what is the +int got to do with high dps melee class weapon...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>36774</b></h3>In my opinion the blades of azzinoth will PROBABLY drop from illidan but the stats will be reduced a lot</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Unholysergeant</b></h3>Quote from Blizzard:<br />&quot;You won't so much as kill him, but you'll more just get in his way&quot; Him being Illidan.<br />Why would some puny mortals be able to kill a powerful demi-demon with an even more powerful force on his side? Exactly.<br /><br />On to the blades:<br />If Blizzard put these in, do you know how much complaining they will be receiving?<br />Just because they look awesome, and you have fantasies about them, doesn't mean we need them. I'll admit they are cool, but think what it would do! If you really want it make a private server.<br />The ONLY way I can see these being implemented, is for the Illidan battle in Black Temple, which Shinu, is coming out in a near future patch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8763</b></h3>From patch 2.1 notes:<br /><br />His dominion over Outland remained unchallenged until the arrival of Illidan the Betrayer. The pit lord proved no match for the wielder of the Twin Blades of Azzinoth. Today Illidan occupies the temple, awaiting any and all who would challenge his rule.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html</a><br /><br />It's therefore possible that this item will be dropped by Illidan, or that he may unlock some sort of epic quest to obtain this item (or, an updated version thereof).<br /><br />This is all speculation though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK, I have been reading this thread for a while, and it is starting to piss me off about how little you all know.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The proc as described on this weapon IS in the .mpq files so this sword WILL be a drop from illidan, but I doubt that it will be as poweful as this.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>first of all, this does not exist nor will it. the people who say its not in yet but will be in expansion are probably wrong. it is not in existance, and if it was in this or the expansion it would ruin the game. those weilding it would just won everything, they wouldnt not curse themselvess by creating it. besides, the best 2 hand wep in hte game tops just over 80 dps, and im supposed to believe that a 1 hand has over 100? plus, even if u can kill illidan in the expansion, they woiuldnt have him srop an artifact. if u kill the current capital bosses...thrall and such, u dont get anything really special. just a lot fo honor. why would a class boss drop an artifact? it makes no sense in general</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Even if this weapon was made acquirable at some point in the game, I'm doubtful that it will keep the stats or speed it currently has (just like the ashbringer). So far it is just a GM toy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I see everyone arguing about it being a Hunter/Rogue/Warrior item and can't help but think that you are stereotyping the classes into rolls that wouldn't be used with this weapon. Look at it as a Shamy/Pally item and tell me if it doesn't fit better? What line on that weapon couldn't be used by either a shamy or pally? The stats &amp; item bonus combined work better for those 2 than any other class. Shamys &amp; Pallys can do more than heal. <br /><br />Just wish feral druids could use swords now...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, first of all this weapon is NOT the weapon Illidan has. If you want the Illidans crescent blades you have to dual wield the seperate warglaives. This weapon looks like a foursided boomerang(for those of you with limited imaginiations that also means VERY LAME!). Second, its not that great. after you've played with it for about 10 minutes you start to think: &quot;gee, i look like an asshat with this weapon&quot;. If you want Illidans weapon this is not it. You won't get Illidan's weapon either because its impossible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For all the people wondering why GM's have items - Generally and historicaly in other MMO's GM's have amazing swords - 1 item with amazing regen - 1 rez item - 1 item with insane stats <br /><br />This is because in most game they don't give GM's a command to kill. By doing that it opens up the potential of hacking a command to /kill a mob per say. <br /><br />So GM's have items like this for the case that say a guild is raiding. The server crashes and when it comes back up the zone has repoped - lets say the guild was fighting a boss when they come back into game they are /pwned by whatever boss - so GM can just kill mob and rez guild into same place with out making them eat spirit healer rez and all that</div>

Tasted like chicken.<br />Furthermore, if you are exalted with Bloodsail Buccaneers (yes, it is possible, the cat told my brother) and have this equipped, you get a spell that summons Illidan as your mount, which has 1000% running speed and lets you cast spells and fight while mounted, but only if you are in a group with a bald gnome with purple beard.<br /><br />LISTEN; it's true! A GM's hamster dont lie!</div>

If I had it definately would enchant with +30 spell damage...tho I'm assuming stats will change a bit before expantion.<br />For those that keep arguing about GM's and their items exist or doesnt exist, if they dont exist then how can they apear infront of you or talk to you in game? (even tho it is rare to see a GM in game) I'm curious in what all GMs do. I'm sure they just don't sit around all day taking care of player complaints or there wouldn't be a waiting time on the open tickets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah it's real. Allakhazam doesn't usually have fake crap in their database.<br /><br />Of course it is 70 and untill the burning crusade comes out will be impossible to get without as said IC commands of a server you have full access to. <br /><br />They are the blades that Illidan uses, he will be one of the hardest bosses in game come burning crusade, so GL getting it unless you are in a guild that has naxx on farm status and is making the legendary staff.<br /><br />As Thundrefury the much disputed sword is nto a drop and invloves two rare drops to start a quest, and over 1000 arcanite bars, it is most likely that this weapon will be from a very long chain quest involving many mroe then 2 extremely rare drops that only drop off extremely high end raid bosses, and probably rare items from skilled crafters in at least 3-4 professions.<br /><br />This weapon is real. It is in game right now and veiwable in wow reader and on private servers. And thus because of it's overpoweredness, it would seem appropriate that the previously mentioned difficulties of obtaining it are quite probable.<br /><br />No one will ever get this for a very VERY long time after the final boss in burning crusade has been downed... That is if you dont' need it to kill him in the first place.<br /><br />In that case, it will be a long time before we see the alst boss down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Illidan the ruler of outland has this weapon, he is also the last boss in BC. Most likely he drops something to start a long quest to ge them.</div>

GMs can make weapons when they are a 6th level of GM. Look up Martin Thunder, that is a GM weapon. If u7 wanna see how GMs work, go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">www.youtube.com</a> and search for World of warcraft. scroll throught the movies to see &quot;How Powerful Is A GM&quot; i think. its cool. i also think you should see &quot;Leeroy Jenkins&quot;.</div>
