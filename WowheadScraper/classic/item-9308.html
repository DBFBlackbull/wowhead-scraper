<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I had about 20 Grime-Encrusted Objects to clean and got some useful itmes. I got 3 Lesser Moonstones, 2 Jades, Tigerseye, Lead Ore, Rough Stones, and more. I also got a bunch of crappy items like pebbles and such.<br /><br />I plan to sell everything at the AH of course.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To get to the clean room (where these objects can be used) enter the &quot;front&quot; entrance, turn left at the intersection, take your second left into the dormitory, then immediately go right and down the stairs. There are lots of 30-ish gnomes down there, green to alliance, so I'm not sure how they'll react to the horde.<br /><br />I've had very mixed results, more bad than good. I just made a special trip in to get rid of the 5 that I had on me, spent 15s to wash them, and ended up with 3s worth of crap. Once I got a nice green item for a low-mid 20's that I gave to a guildie, but for the most part you'll get things like ore and other things that are really not worth it. If you're a gambler (or much wealthier than I am) go for it, occasionally you'll get something good. But for penny pinchers, it might be more worth it to sell the objects themselves for a couple silver rather than pay a few silver to get nothing most of the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>what i can do whith this?¿¿? im a in horde and only see aliance quests, sombody know something abot this?¿?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hi may i know what this item is used for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you can &quot;wash&quot; them off in the survivor city in underground Gnomeregan, in the &quot;Sparklematic 5200&quot;<br /><br />the object then becomes some random item, sometimes good, sometimes crappy :)<br /><br />I don't know of any other place to &quot;clean&quot; them, hence my coming here to look...but I know you can do it at least there. If anyone knows of another place in Azeroth where you can wash them, I'd appreciate a post. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, after cleaning most of the stuff is a bunch of crap, but i did get a Gnomeregan Band of Agility. Did about 20, this was the only thing worth while i got.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Codybold</b></h3>I wanted to get rid of the 15 Grime-encrusted objects I picked up from NPCs I fought. I found out how to redeem them in these posts. I had to fight my way down to the clean room as a lvl 43 paly. Got killed once, but as I followed the floor map, I found I could avoid many of the fights just by staying away from possible combatants. At one point, I jumped up on the safety wall and fell over to the level the clean room was on. One at a time, I bought a clean for each of the objects, which came back as a nicely wrapped package. I didn't get any remarkable returns, a few malachites, lead ore, iron, ore, small lusterous pearl, silver ore, moss agate, smooth pebble, tin ore. I could have done better on quests, dungeons, or raids. Almost a waste of time. The enemy NPCs, were at level 25+, all more than 10 lvls below mine, so I didn't gain any experience points. I did pick up some decent gear for sale. This run to the clean room is really meant for lvl 25-30 players in dungeon mode.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ricmortis</b></h3>Some of these directions are confusing. Get to the instance entrance. Once you walk through, go straight down the hallway past all the baddies who like to aggro mobs. At the intersection, turn left. Go past a bunch more baddies til you see the 2nd left turn. Basically, you you can go left or right once in the dormitory as it goes around. On the opposite end the path goes downward. Follow this til you get to the big room and go to the left. That is where the Dormitory is at.<br /><br />As far as worth, I turned in 15 of these &quot;Objects.&quot; All I got out of it was a single low level bullet, Rough and Coarse stones, 3 Tin Ores, 2 Lesser Moonstones and 1 Iridescent Pearl. Not worth battling to turn in.</div>
