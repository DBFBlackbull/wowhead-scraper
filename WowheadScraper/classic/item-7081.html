<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i killed one in tanaris and he droped it killed about 20 more and no drop it wouldnt be so bad but the spawn and the drop on this is rare so it sucks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I saw one once when i was lvl 40 in tanaris.. bgut i searched for over 3 hours and didnt even find ONE elemental.. <br />pretty sweet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well i killed 3 gusting vortex and got 2 breath of winds and i was merely passing by...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, I have been killing Gusting Vortex by the droves. So far have dropped 92 of them. Only found 2, count them &quot;2&quot; Breath of Wid's. So the percentage they have on them for Tanaris is way off. Its more like less then 2% then 45%. You would think that at 45% like it states above, I would have somewhere around 42-44 of them. Well, I have a whopping &quot;2&quot; of them. So this cant be correct. Not even in the same city much less the same ballpark.</div>
