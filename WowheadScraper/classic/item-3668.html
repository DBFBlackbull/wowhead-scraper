After going thru literally every page that has to do with this quest, (the item itself, the NPCs, ect) Both classic and retail versions to see all comments (can't see comments past BC on classic version and can't see classic\/other website comments on retail versions of the pages) I can, with 100% confidence, say that we, as a community, even after 16+ years, have 0 info on this item other than the fact that it EXISTS and what mob it drops from. The shear amount of time and effort I have put into this is nuts. I spent over 6 hours in hillsbrad\/alterac mountains hoping to find it, some times riding around to the spots they have been confirmed to be at when they spawn and using my true sight racial (human) I even marked the farmer everyone agreed to follow with a blue box so I always knew where he was at all times. I managed to get my fishing skill up from 270 something to 290 while here just fishing in pools I had come across, as well as max out most of my weapon skills (paladin) on turtles, murlocs, naga and critters around town. I filled my bags with so much leather I had to vendor some just to loot this thing when they DID spawn.\r\n\r\nI regularly kept track of how many people were in the zone with \/who for hillsbrad, at the time they did spawn, there were 4 total alliance in the zone, one being me, who had done all other quests in the zone prior. There was a 60 warrior in town as well as a 38 palli, and a druid somewhere in the zone according to my \/who at the time. I had gone AFK in the town center between the inn and the town hall to read memes on discord, but left my sound on, shortly after that I heard the sound of a male human die and instantly tabbed back to see the Crier was dead at my feet. I lept to my mount and spammed my target macro and instantly found assassins, they spawn out of stealth, in their set spawn points then enter stealth. The guards did not seem to attack them UNTIL they attacked others. I managed to get the tag on my first kill and helped the 38 palli get his in a group. In total I 'think' 6 died while I was there, 4 of which were from me. The drop rate is 100%, me and him both got our drops first kill. It says 80 something % on their page because you can't loot it after completing the quest.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if it was that druid out and about that was questing that spawned the event, if it was a HORDE quest that does it, (they already have a quest to spawn an elite in our GY) Or if it really is just on a timer. But seeing as how it times are not anywhere near something that would seem.. uhh, based on time, (mine spawned at 6:10 AM. My chat logs say the Crier had said \"Hear ye hear ye!\" at exactly 6:10:33. The times I seen from other comments also seem to be completely random. I assume it has something to do with a quest but not in town, perhaps when someone picks up the stack of papers in alterac by the syndicate on their table it starts the event? But the player whom actually did would not be in town at the time. Or maybe it is something the horde did. There were people on both factions questing during the 6 hours I was there, I saw a 25 troll priest by the farms, a 33 troll hunter farming turtles up stream, and many alliance. But I still could not tell you what made the event spawn. The only way I think we will truly find out is if you get together several accounts\/players and test it yourself, testing quests and other such things from both factions in a controlled experiment to see what may be the cause, or it might just have a random spawn early morning\/afternoon.
