What I mean by a lasting effect is that from a Titan you will for 2hours have 1.2k more health, and seeing that you will most of the time get heals, it lasts. Supreme Power adds a flat modifier to your damage and is sustainable. \r\n\r\nDistilled Wisdom on the other hand is a little less useful in most of the longer fights in the game. The reason for this is that when you start casting, you will continously use more and more mana and won't be regening up to the maximum amount unless you get an innervate or a mana break. If you are able to regen up to full while casting then the extra mana is useless simply because you regen faster then you use mana and therefore don't drop. Due to all this it's effect can be compared to a preemptive mana potion letting you cast for 2k more. \r\n\r\nThe times this flask will shine through is on mana intensive trash packs that allows you to regen between fights since you will continously regen the extra 2k mana. \r\n\r\nSince healers kind of lack a flask like titans for tanks and supreme for dps, we will in The burning crusade get a flask with 70 mana \/ 5 sec, which easily is more usefull in general.","date":"2006-12-06T20:50:00-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"''So bottom line is... if you are a healer who stays OOM... you need this potion, or at least I strongly recommend it.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7579</b></h3>When is this flask useful?<br />In many cases Distilled wisdom is of less use then Flask of Titans and Flask of supreme power due to it's lack of a lasting effect. What I mean by a lasting effect is that from a Titan you will for 2hours have 1.2k more health, and seeing that you will most of the time get heals, it lasts. Supreme Power adds a flat modifier to your damage and is sustainable. <br /><br />Distilled Wisdom on the other hand is a little less useful in most of the longer fights in the game. The reason for this is that when you start casting, you will continously use more and more mana and won't be regening up to the maximum amount unless you get an innervate or a mana break. If you are able to regen up to full while casting then the extra mana is useless simply because you regen faster then you use mana and therefore don't drop. Due to all this it's effect can be compared to a preemptive mana potion letting you cast for 2k more. <br /><br />The times this flask will shine through is on mana intensive trash packs that allows you to regen between fights since you will continously regen the extra 2k mana. <br /><br />Since healers kind of lack a flask like titans for tanks and supreme for dps, we will in The burning crusade get a flask with 70 mana / 5 sec, which easily is more usefull in general.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>izlude</b></h3>This is the worst flask of all.<br /><br />If you are looking to do great pve healing you need supreme power.<br />2000 mana more is a mana pot (all be it you have that 2k for each trash mob before the boss fight, but in pve ur worried about the boss fight.) <br /><br />if you have 7000 mana and drop a 300 mana heal at a 3.0 speed cast 149 spec per heal turns in to hugely more heal power then the 2000 mana could have ever have been.<br /><br />the only real use for this flask is a shaman/paladin to pvp with it on for crazy mana pool all the time. (though even then id take titans for pvp)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>31494</b></h3>As a pally running Black Morass, and being the primary healer/add killer for it. This has come in handy, with 18 total rift lords/keeper/boss's coming in a fast sequence of 6 then a break it was very handy havin 2k extra mana. Although I agree that a holy priest proably has better choices, for a pally it was a definite bonus in mana lasting thru the 6 boss's before respite in the Black Morass</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have seen it drop several times now a couple of times with my main charater wich isn't a Alchemist and with my Warlock who is, last week I won it for once and I am saving up the materials to make a shipload of these flasks so I can use a couple in MC/BWL and outlast the rest of the casters without using manapots and sell a couple I have seen these sell for +/- 60 gold on AH the material needed for one flask in total cost 45 gold on AH, so I can grind for the materials or just buy them on AH and still make a bundle of money.<br /><br />Server Bloodhof</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'd say this is the Rarest of the flasks. I have seen all the other recipe's on the AH, found a Supreme Power recipe at 50g, and Titans at 90g (Titans goes for 1500g on Bloodfeather). I also found a Chromatic resistance one, but it was at 950g bid, no BO. If you see this at a reasonable price as an alchemist, buy it without hesitation. MT healers need it badly :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm an alchemist/herbalist and make a good living that way. About a month ago, I was down to 52 silver because I used up what gold I had for repairs from Molten Core grinding over a few months. I was in the process of relocating residences so I only logged in for MC raids twice a week and nothing else. Repairs on epic gear eat your gold up fast. Anyway I now have about 900G with about 200G of wares in the AH. I have never and will never buy gold. You just have to not be lazy to make that kind of money. If I see the recipe for 400G or less in AH, I'm snapping it up. About two weeks ago it was on sale for 400G bid, 550G buyout, but I was just shy of 400G at that point.<br />:(&nbsp; &nbsp; I currently have the ability to make chromatic resistance and supreme power. If I get the distilled wisdom and titan ability, I'll be a much stronger asset to my guild.&nbsp; (Horde of Morrigan, Kilrogg server). Zug zug!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>2% droprate + the fact that Balnazzar is the last mob in Scarlet Strat = Hundreds of hours of painful disappointment.<br /><br />When and if this recipe ever drops for me....if I get ninja'd I might go Office Space on my computer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah i like to know that too. <br /><br />Anyone Exalted with Cenarion Expedition that can tell us if this baby can be traded away or sold on AH?<br /><br />It would be sweet to just have my main to reach exhalted once and then buy this stuff for my alcemist alt.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>400/475g BO<br /><br />There are 2 different recipes.<br /><br />1 you can buy &amp; use when exalted @ CE<br /><br />(you can not use this recipe when your not exalted @ CE)<br /><br />And one that drops from last boss in strat, in which case you do not need to be exalted to use it, but you do need lots of luck before it finally drops!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I won this on the AH last night for 381g and learned something useful about the bidding time in the AH:<br /><br />I happened to refresh available recipes and see the time left change from &quot;medium&quot; to &quot;short&quot; (no BO price was available), so I knew exactly when to bid to try to win this recipe without letting the other person have more than 1 minute to outbid me again.&nbsp; I bid at the right moment, but was outbid a second later.&nbsp; After a few rounds of us each bidding, I noticed the time left went back UP to &quot;medium.&quot;&nbsp; Apparently, bidding at the last second --&nbsp; or bidding multiple times once the time says &quot;short&quot; -- adds time to the auction and can push it all the way back up to medium.&nbsp; This is the 2nd time I have observed this, so I am sure I did not misread the time.&nbsp; Just FYI . . .</div>

As always it did'nt:). The normal going price on our server was 1200 gold bid and 2000 gold buyout. In October I managed to find it for 700 gold and purchased it. The only reason I payed was because it's the last one I needed. It would have not been so cheap if not for the Burning Crusade being on the horizon.</div>
