Aren't they the only class allowed to MT high end instances?&nbsp; Shouldn't they be restricted to main hand weapons and sheilds? But wait, warriors have a different spec that allows them to dish out phenomenal DPS with either dual weilding or 2h weapons.&nbsp; So if a warrior can feel free to spec themselves however they want, why can't there be a retro pally dishing out mass DPS in between heals? Or a hunter who choses to poison and debuff and wear down their opponents with range and then decemate them with melee?\n\nI've seen plenty of raids with players who tear through instances and high end bosses easily because they have all of their classes functioning at full efficiancy, with hunters and paladins doing their jobs [b] and [\/b] adding mass DPS.\n\nSure it might be nice to have this weapon before any other class does.&nbsp; And if your guild chooses to favor drops to one class at first that's for them to decide.&nbsp; But the endless bickering over which class gets what weapon is pointless, because all three classes can use two handed weapons to their full potential, and if someone feels that the weapon they'd like to roll on is better for their spec than the one you think they should have, they're most likely right, because they know their spec and play style better than you do.","date":"2006-09-22T03:06:34-05:00","rating":24,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"warmarrer","importedSubject":"Warrior vs Paladin vs Hunter"},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":2648799,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Anyone know any lore about this weapon?","date":"2006-09-22T03:06:34-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"This sword was the sword wielded by Lord Anduin Lothar during the first two wars.&nbsp; Thats why the initials A.L. are etched into the blade.","creationdate":"2006-09-22T03:06:34-05:00","id":1158702,"rating":4,"commentid":2648799,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"akkristor","importedSubject":"A.L"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"silverbeard11","importedSubject":"Anyone?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":14,"id":2648824,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Whoever said this is a hunter weapon over warriors is truly a retard.&nbsp; Sure, a variety of classes can benefit from a weapon.&nbsp; But, gear is always allocated by DKP or some other system to the class it is BEST suited for.&nbsp; Period.\n\nSo, no warrior would be given preference over a hunter for a good ranged weapon, even if they could use the stats, because hunters would make best use of it.\n\nLikewise, until BC this is one of the most uber 2-handers in the game, particularly since it's a sword, and the warrior sword talent gives a double hit proc, so when it fires both attacks give white damage, and therefore both generate rage.\n\nThe guy who said hunters should roll on this over warriors must never have raided in his life, because no guild that could get this would give it to a hunter over a warrior, and if anyone seriously suggested it they would be laughed out of the instance.\n\nI'm a warrior, and I happen to have a Blastershot Launcher.&nbsp; The only reason I do is all our hunters have better, and the DPS warriors and rogues rolled on it for the stats.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; No point in letting it go to waste.&nbsp; But I would never, nor would I ever be permitted, to roll on that over a hunter.\n\nWhenever I hear this crap about \"I can use it too so I should get it\", it's usually from someone who is either\/or a noob, selfish, immature, or a casual player with gear envy.&nbsp; Even if I'm in a pug, I won't roll on something that's obviously superior for another class, even if I can use it.","date":"2006-12-04T03:06:34-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"cutter44","importedSubject":"Give me a break"},{"commentv2":1,"number":15,"id":2648837,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"There are multiple references to Lothar in World of Warcraft.

Raptor Strike is a joke, I don't know hunters are so proud of it.\n[Chartreuse]Did I ever say that I was proud of it, ermm wait no I didnt.[\/Chartreuse]\nYou get a 20% crit with it?  Something dodges and a warrior gets 50% chance to crit with this, and yes mobs do dodge.  On top of that, the top end factors in heavily to a mortal strike, making it very useful to a warrior.  And for anyone who says warriors never MS in raids, it makes Ebonroc a much faster match, which will be done more routinely than a hunter will pull aggro off casters.  WTF is that, anyway?  Does your guild have Downs?  IF you ever needed a hunter to pull aggro, it would be so that they can kite something until a tank gets free, not so that they melee.  So you'd use distracting shot, as your PoS raptor strike is far inferior to whatever a mage, lock, or priest is throwing out to generate threat.\n[Chartreuse]Agreed we dont Melee but to say that we just sit there and \/shoot would be stupid I can tell that you have never played beyond your warrior to tell what the Hunter class can and does actualy achieve yet it wont change your mind since you think that every Melee weapon is a Warrior weapon[\/Chartreuse]\n\nIt's not a hunter weapon.\n[Chartreuse]Did I ever state that it was a Hunter Weapon?

Any melee weapon you use is a glorified trinket, and you know it.\n[Chartreuse]Thats why all Warriors never carry a Ranged weapon right, oh wait they do dont they sorry then would you call that a glorified trinket then?[\/Chartreuse]\nSo in your greedy mind, you're saying \"Well, I could just use Zin'Rokh which is still an awesome weapon as my trinket, or rather than allow someone use a main-weapon, I could say that this 2H weapon is an even better TRINKET for me, and say I need it.\"  Are you serious?  Rogues and fury warriors need critical strike, but they don't claim preference on ranged weapons that produce it.  That's the thing about a lot of hunters (not all) that gets to me -- you think everything that benefits you belongs to you.  Ashkandi is a hands down amazing melee weapon and should go to a melee class first, just as ranged weapons go to YOU first.  Itemization, just use two 1H's.\n[Chartreuse]I could say the same there are better weapons in the Game for a warrior, but this is the most DPS adding weapon there is for a Hunter there is not 'better' weapon than this for adding more dps that i can think of.[\/Chartreuse]\n\nI'm glad people like you will never see the end of Blackwing Lair, so it will never be a real issue -- and if you do, it's only because you had a really good guild who let you sit on \/follow.  So in my opinion, it should go to warriors first, and honestly I don't care if pallies or hunters get it after that.  If you want it that badly, re-roll.\n[Chartreuse]I feel sorry that you had to personaly attack me so i must of hit a sore spot ;) Merry Christmas[\/Chartreuse]\n\n[i][small]Edited, Dec 24th 2006  8:35am by Gestahlt[\/small][\/i][\/quote]\n\nI know there are lots of Fantastic and great Warriors out there (the majority are) and i do know that there are worst hunters but please atleast look at what it does for the hunter :P","date":"2006-12-27T16:00:51-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I'll answer your statements in the order that they are (in bold).\n\n[b]\nDid I ever say that I was proud of it, ermm wait no I didnt.

So the chances you see a Paladin with these weapons are greater then you seeing a warrior with this weapon.\n\nEdited, Fri Mar  3 14:04:10 2006","date":"2006-03-03T20:03:08-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I don't know what kind of raids you're in, but if you've actually looked at the warrior Protection Tree lately, you'll know that most of the talents beyond the third tier are generally not worth the investment.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7576</b></h3>This is a pretty good weapon for 3 classes in particular: Warrior, Hunter, and Paladin<br /><br />Warrior - The top-end damage on Ashkandi makes it a very powerful Mortal Strike weapon. The additional stats (33 STA, 86 AP) also are of great help to warriors. Definely one of the game's better weapons for warriors. <br /><br />Hunter - Weapon damage dosent exactly matter as much since Hunter's probably shouldnt be fighting melee battles. However, 86AP - especially since after 2.01 is a significant buff to their ranged weapon, and you can't go wrong with 33 Stamina. A good weapon for stats. <br /><br />Paladin - Seal of Command tends to like weapons with high top-end damage, so Ashkandi fits well into that. The melee attack power and extra stamina boost also make this a pretty good weapon for a Ret pally.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b> WHAT THE $%^&amp; </b><br /><br />Honestly, while I can understand how frusterated a warrior could be by losing this to a hunter or a paladin, there is no weapon that is bound to one class unless the item specifies.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ok, so your warrior is melee near 100% of the time.&nbsp; That does make it crucial to have a good weapon.<br /><br />Paladins can heal, but this does <b> NOT </b> mean that it's the only thing they can do.&nbsp; Paladins can have amazing DPS given the right spec, and in any solo PvP or PvE they also need a good weapon.<br /><br />Hunters have ranged attacks, and traps and wing clip, making it maybe a small bit less important for them to have a good melee weapon.&nbsp; However, hunters can often be forced into melee combat due to PvP or some PvE situations involving more than one mob.<br /><br />So given that it is important for all 3 classes to have a good melee weapon, what's all the #$%^ing fighting about?<br /><br />Warriors want first dibs, they do all the tanking, they should be rewarded.&nbsp; <br /><br />Paladins want a chance for a good weapon, as is often denied them under the arguements about what &quot;class&quot; an item should be or about whether or not paladins can DPS.<br /><br />Hunters want a good Melee weapon, which they are denied even more often for the same reason, and the fighting over whether or not a good hunter uses melee.<br /><br />The fact is, <b> ALL THREE </b> classes have a use for this, or any other melee weapon.&nbsp; Unless a melee weapon has a fairly class specific stat like +def (for tanks) or + ranged AP (for hunters) or + healing (for pallies), then it should be a tossup between the three classes which can utilize the weapon.<br /><br />I've heard arguements that people don't raid to outfit their players for PvP so pallies and hunters don't need these weapons.&nbsp; Then why do warriors need these weapons? Aren't they the only class allowed to MT high end instances?&nbsp; Shouldn't they be restricted to main hand weapons and sheilds? But wait, warriors have a different spec that allows them to dish out phenomenal DPS with either dual weilding or 2h weapons.&nbsp; So if a warrior can feel free to spec themselves however they want, why can't there be a retro pally dishing out mass DPS in between heals? Or a hunter who choses to poison and debuff and wear down their opponents with range and then decemate them with melee?<br /><br />I've seen plenty of raids with players who tear through instances and high end bosses easily because they have all of their classes functioning at full efficiancy, with hunters and paladins doing their jobs <b> and </b> adding mass DPS.<br /><br />Sure it might be nice to have this weapon before any other class does.&nbsp; And if your guild chooses to favor drops to one class at first that's for them to decide.&nbsp; But the endless bickering over which class gets what weapon is pointless, because all three classes can use two handed weapons to their full potential, and if someone feels that the weapon they'd like to roll on is better for their spec than the one you think they should have, they're most likely right, because they know their spec and play style better than you do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whoever said this is a hunter weapon over warriors is truly a retard.&nbsp; Sure, a variety of classes can benefit from a weapon.&nbsp; But, gear is always allocated by DKP or some other system to the class it is BEST suited for.&nbsp; Period.<br /><br />So, no warrior would be given preference over a hunter for a good ranged weapon, even if they could use the stats, because hunters would make best use of it.<br /><br />Likewise, until BC this is one of the most uber 2-handers in the game, particularly since it's a sword, and the warrior sword talent gives a double hit proc, so when it fires both attacks give white damage, and therefore both generate rage.<br /><br />The guy who said hunters should roll on this over warriors must never have raided in his life, because no guild that could get this would give it to a hunter over a warrior, and if anyone seriously suggested it they would be laughed out of the instance.<br /><br />I'm a warrior, and I happen to have a Blastershot Launcher.&nbsp; The only reason I do is all our hunters have better, and the DPS warriors and rogues rolled on it for the stats.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; No point in letting it go to waste.&nbsp; But I would never, nor would I ever be permitted, to roll on that over a hunter.<br /><br />Whenever I hear this crap about &quot;I can use it too so I should get it&quot;, it's usually from someone who is either/or a noob, selfish, immature, or a casual player with gear envy.&nbsp; Even if I'm in a pug, I won't roll on something that's obviously superior for another class, even if I can use it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There are multiple references to Lothar in World of Warcraft. What is assumed to be Lothar's sword, Ashkandi, Greatsword of the Brotherhood, makes an appearance in World of Warcraft as an extremely rare epic two-handed sword that drops from the boss Nefarian in Blackwing Lair - when the cursor is moved over the weapon, under all the stats it states &quot;The initials A.L. are engraved into the hilt&quot;. This would imply that Lothar was indeed killed at Blackrock Spire, for Nefarian is found at the highest point of Blackrock Spire, in the Blackwing Lair. There is also a World of Warcraft realm (server) named for Lothar. There is also a statue of Lothar in the Burning Steppes, south of Black Rock Mountain - another indication of his death.</div>

Its an fact that pallys just have to life with, as they should do what the Raid leader says. If he says dps hten go dps. Do he say heal/buff then Heal/buff. In my guild im about just under the most warlocks/mages and rogue's and hunters. But im also over alot of them. (in Damage done meter). The paladins are in the bottom.</div>

Barb of the sand reaver is easily the better hunter weapon as Harmaahapsi proved this before and i can't be bothered to reiterate. So can hunters stop taking all the good looking weapons just because it'll look impressive when there in the major cities? However after all warriors and maybe even paladins have got it then sure roll away :) lol,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>One thing I notice; most of those complaining have little to no knowledge of the Paladin class.<br />Honestly, having played a Priest, Rogue, and a Paladin to 60, I find the uses of any and every end of game weapon as good on a Paladin as it would be on a Warrior.<br />Most of these type of weapons are not even used in BWL/MC.<br />The highest DPS Warriors are usually Fury to begin with; Arms is merely used on Ebonroc and similar fights merely for the support of Mortal Strike. (Key word here: Support).<br />Likewise, most Paladins are used for Cleanse; (Another support ability) just far more frequently. Something they can do while being upfront meleeing and keeping Judgements up to maintain mana regen on spell casters and Hunters active (once again, another supportive move).<br /><br />Not saying Warrior damage isn't worthwhile, but that likewise, Paladin damage is also welcomed in instances that are down to farm status.<br /><br />Face it. You won't be DPSing as you make progression through a new instance, neither as a Warrior, nor as a Paladin.<br />You will be tanking and healing/cleansing.<br /><br />These weapons are mostly used in PVP.<br />In PVP, a Paladin with Reckoning and 2H Spec can easily match or even surpass a Warrior in terms of damage.<br />While you may see higher numbers as a Warrior due to Enrage; a Paladin can deal up to 4,000-6,000 damage with multiple Reckoning crits stacked under 2H Spec; all in a split second, for an instant one shooter.<br />This is, with a decent weapon.<br />Nothing like Ashkandi.<br /><br />You've seen damage like this from Enrage/Sword Spec and multiple crits as your Warrior I am certain?<br /><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5691789779502685227" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5691789779502685227</a><br />I am sure you have.<br />If you do happen to be as well geared and buffed as him, that is.<br /><br />Don't hate your fellow Paladins for spending well earned DKP on what they desire.<br />Learn to DKP and appreciate the efforts of others while maintaining a good sport's attitude in the race to highest DKP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">If your guild is relying on hunters to get aggro off of things, you won't be seeing this sword anyway. Raptor Strike is a joke, I don't know hunters are so proud of it.<br />Did I ever say that I was proud of it, ermm wait no I didnt.<br />You get a 20% crit with it? Something dodges and a warrior gets 50% chance to crit with this, and yes mobs do dodge. On top of that, the top end factors in heavily to a mortal strike, making it very useful to a warrior. And for anyone who says warriors never MS in raids, it makes Ebonroc a much faster match, which will be done more routinely than a hunter will pull aggro off casters. WTF is that, anyway? Does your guild have Downs? IF you ever needed a hunter to pull aggro, it would be so that they can kite something until a tank gets free, not so that they melee. So you'd use distracting shot, as your PoS raptor strike is far inferior to whatever a mage, lock, or priest is throwing out to generate threat.<br />Agreed we dont Melee but to say that we just sit there and /shoot would be stupid I can tell that you have never played beyond your warrior to tell what the Hunter class can and does actualy achieve yet it wont change your mind since you think that every Melee weapon is a Warrior weapon<br /><br />It's not a hunter weapon.<br />Did I ever state that it was a Hunter Weapon? Incorrect I didnt thats you trying to validate your claim over all melee weapons again...<br />A hunter can use it, yes, but never again try to validate that this weapon should go to a hunter first.<br />Again I never stated that this should go to a Hunter First maybe you should stop trying to hoard your weapons and look at what is being written<br />They do have hunter weapons in this game, they're called ranged weapons. Any melee weapon you use is a glorified trinket, and you know it.<br />Thats why all Warriors never carry a Ranged weapon right, oh wait they do dont they sorry then would you call that a glorified trinket then?<br />So in your greedy mind, you're saying &quot;Well, I could just use Zin'Rokh which is still an awesome weapon as my trinket, or rather than allow someone use a main-weapon, I could say that this 2H weapon is an even better TRINKET for me, and say I need it.&quot; Are you serious? Rogues and fury warriors need critical strike, but they don't claim preference on ranged weapons that produce it. That's the thing about a lot of hunters (not all) that gets to me -- you think everything that benefits you belongs to you. Ashkandi is a hands down amazing melee weapon and should go to a melee class first, just as ranged weapons go to YOU first. Itemization, just use two 1H's.<br />I could say the same there are better weapons in the Game for a warrior, but this is the most DPS adding weapon there is for a Hunter there is not 'better' weapon than this for adding more dps that i can think of.<br /><br />I'm glad people like you will never see the end of Blackwing Lair, so it will never be a real issue -- and if you do, it's only because you had a really good guild who let you sit on /follow. So in my opinion, it should go to warriors first, and honestly I don't care if pallies or hunters get it after that. If you want it that badly, re-roll.<br />I feel sorry that you had to personaly attack me so i must of hit a sore spot ;) Merry Christmas<br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 24th 2006 8:35am by Gestahlt</i></div><br /><br />I know there are lots of Fantastic and great Warriors out there (the majority are) and i do know that there are worst hunters but please atleast look at what it does for the hunter :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Also, this sword does basically the same dmg per hit with the Grand Marshal sword, however, in a 60 sec time span, it does 5238 dmg, and the grand Marshal does 4600 dmg. <br /><br />Stat wise, they are not too far apart. This sword has a equivalent of 43 strength, and the grand marshal has 26. But the grand marshal gives 1% crit and 13 more stam, and it's probably easier to get unless you count on the fact that once this baby drop, you guarantee to get it.<br /><br />In any case, my dream set armor + this sword will give me a 5100 HP, 5042 MP, 748 ATP, 11 - 12 % crit from gear ONLY, +5% base crit? <br />and I'm a paladin.

So warriors can do a higher dps without worrying about seals or w/e.<br /><br /> And Hunters, isn't there better DW axes or something that drop in BWL and MC?</div>

Don't make up your own rules; if something is equipable for a particular class it IS MEANT to be used by that class.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a hunter weapon as much as it is a warrior weapon. Hunters use it's stats 100% of the time, same as warriors. As far as the damage and whatnot goes, hunters are forced into a deadzone more times than not where raptor strikes critting for 1300+ won't be too bad. <br /><br />Bottom line, this item doesn't have a class requirment, therefore any class should be able to roll on it WHENEVER they want. Nuff said.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a priest weapon. Yah, look at those stats, they have healing all over it. If this went to a warrior before a priest i'd be PISSED!~!1!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I see people saying hunters dont need this cause in RAIDS they dont melee, so it should goto warrs/pally's okay.. I don't see too many warrior's 2handing swords in raids at all, and pally's well, if your using that to heal.. just /uninstall.<br /><br />Now, i agree this does benefit warrior's more PvP wise and whatnot, but hunters DO use the stats (In raid and not) also i find myself meleeing more times than not, crushing a mage with a 1300-1500 Raptor strike can't be bad.<br /><br />I'm happy to say i should be first to get this in my guild, cause no warriors want it, and im horde, so no pallies.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is Currently After patch 2.01 rated as the BEST DPS improving weopon to a hunter ..... yes better than Eye of Nerub, in that aspect. <br /><a href="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i179/razrok/hunterweapons.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i179/razrok/hunterweapons.jpg</a><br />That is cause agility = 1 ap now.<br /><br /> However the very important thing that makes this surely less usefull for hunters in RAids is the Improved chance to hit from all the added skills to ranged from Eye of nerub. However this should not be taken lightly and its obvious that hunters have a great deal of use for it. The calcutlation i think doesnt include crit chance from agility + weopons, however in raids you dont really want a high crit chance to reduce aggro pull. <br /> And Zin'Rok is Rated as the THIRD BEST WEOPON for hunters! Even Surpassing the Barb of The sandreaver in terms of raw base damage. And thats from the Easiest end game instance around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>r14 weapons are better for warriors now, and they are very easy to get (far easier then praying for this thing to drop anyway). Since most warriors will go for them, I think hunter's definitely have a claim to this weapon. As someone mentioned dkp is the main determinant anyways.<br /><br />Also, to the ignorant people who say hunter's only need ranged weapons; Hunter's in pvp are often forced to melee, and when you do it's nice to be swinging a slow, hard hitting 2 hander to get a few heavy hits in before you can gain range again (or use melee as a finisher).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As of the 2.0 update, any weapon with +Crit, +hit, +attack is going to be important for Warriors, Rogues, and Hunters. That stat bonus does not just apply to melee combat. It effects their ranged combat as well. Before 2.0, the only thing a hunter really wanted was Agility. <br />That has drastically changed. Any crit and attack bonuses a hunter can get their hands on is very valuable. <br /><br />Now, in most raids, that sword would probably get first dibs by the warriors or rogues, but it would be unintelligent to say that it would not also benefit a hunter. Depending on who you're raiding with, I suggest you discuss with your officers before the raid whether or not a hunter gets to roll so that there is no fighting in your raid chat. <br /><br />For most raiding guilds it comes down to DKP anyway, so if a hunter has the DKP, I would think he is fully entitled to bid on that sword.<br /><br />So any continued arguement about this is really petty and unnecessary. Take it up with your guild, not the people on this forum.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>When the changes to Attack Power with Instants go live with 1.8, this would be a very close second in DPS to Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros. This sword actuallt has a higher Base DPS, though Sulfuras' higher max damage just takes the lead. This is arguably a lot easier to get, too. Single Nefarian drop vs getting 13 Golemagg Drops for the hammer.</div>

Im a ret pally for pvp so i could make use of that sword when we get to BWL. If I have the dkp for it, im leading, and the warrior doesnt want it then i will spend dkp on it. <br /><br />SoC crits would be insane and I could use this indeffinatly. So, unless it says 'warrior' specific weapon on it, im using it. <br /><br />Sorry to all those pallys who are in guilds that wont let you play and 'actually' contribute other then cleansing. You are more usefull if you actually act like a hybrid and not a wannabe priest in plate. my 2 cents</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This weapon would do well in the hands of a Paladin or a Warrior. Most warriors that go on these raids are DEFENSIVE specced so they would make no use out of this weapon. The reason you see more paladins with these massive 2h weapons is because most warriors that attend BWL and gain a lot of DKP are defensive specced not arms/fury. Since there are more Arms/Fury specced warriors they don't attend as many raids because they are usually switched out so they don't earn as much DKP as a Paladin that goes. So the chances you see a Paladin with these weapons are greater then you seeing a warrior with this weapon.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Mar 3 14:04:10 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>iono if this has been talked about on this wep it probly has im too lazy to read but this is a hunter wepon. add +25 agilitly. its a slow sword hte only melee hunters use are isntant casts, theres the slow factor out of the way. +86 attack power, again for hunters. this is one of thos godly wepons that is not just for a warrior PEOPLE THIS IS A HUNTER WEPON LEAVE IT FOR HUNTERS.<br /><br />Iv had my rant and now hate warrios...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunters do RANGED u no understand? this is pure warrior wep so forget your better &quot;Raptor Strike&quot; just face it u do RANGED this is warrior we should roll on it not u hunters oh and palys u should only get it if a warrior dnt want it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fabi88</b></h3>I am a warrior and I have an upopular opinion - this is indeed primary hunter weapon.<br /><br />Because<br /><br />If you are raiding hard, are you going to give it to warrior just so that they can split more skulls in PVP? NO. You want to boost your raid dps as much as possible for smooth runs. So you give it rather to a hunter, who will be using it in raids.<br />Only when all hunters have it or better - then you can give it to warrs so that they can have fun in PVP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pikseh</b></h3>In terms of raw stats, this weapon is subpar for a hunter - you gain more crit and attack power by using 2 x <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18737/">Bone Slicing Hatchet</a> with +15 agility enchanted on both.<br /><br />However, due to the so-called <a href="https://classicwow.live/guides/1914/raptor-strike-and-you-a-detailed-analysis-and-guide-to-melee-weaving" rel="nofollow">Melee Weaving</a> playstyle that was discovered and popularized on private servers in recent years, using big meaty 2H weapons can be very beneficial to hunters, and can quite easily net you more dps than using &quot;stat sticks&quot; and just doing your ranged rotation from a distance. This playstyle, while a little trickier to pull off in Classic wow due to how batching has been implemented, still gives great results, and a min-maxing guild should consider giving this sword to a hunter.<br /><br />In fact, since dual-wielding is widely accepted as the best way to go about maximizing your dps as a warrior in PvE scenarios, a knowledgeable warrior would never have a particular need of this weapon in PvE (with the small caveat that 2handers are slightly better for doing aoe dps on trash mobs).<br /><br />A reasonable way of setting up a priority system on this item, if your guild uses a loot council, would be<br /><br />1: A hunter who has shown that they are capable of and willing to melee weave successfully<br />2: A warrior/paladin who has shown that they are currently ranking seriously (like rank 10+) but haven't quite hit rank 14 yet and don't already have <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17076">Bonereaver's Edge</a><br />3: Free for all<br /><br />The reason being that a warrior will not add dps to the raid by getting Ashkandi, as dual-wielding virtually anything in combination with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards">Edgemaster's Handguards</a> if you are non-orc/non-human will give you higher dps, whereas a melee weaving hunter <b>will</b> increase their dps by obtaining this weapon. But if none of your hunters are interested in melee weaving, then this should be free for all with a slight upside to warriors and paladins, as this weapon is very strong for PvP for both warriors, paladins and hunters.</div>
