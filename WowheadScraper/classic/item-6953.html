Usually it is easy to find a group and I doubt this is soloable in the low 20s. For the next part you have to pick up some ore in the elite ogre area in Loch Modan. This is very easy to do solo, you will probably only have to fight a few of the ogres to get to the ore which is sitting there right in the open. The next part is to collect a corrupted Kor gem. This can be obtained in BFD and it drops off Naga mobs. You don't even have to go inside the instance, just kill some of the Naga outside the instance until it drops. Finally it's best to save SFK for last as it is the hardest one to solo. I solo'd this at level 22. I fought my way to the room where the guy is held captive in the cell. At this point I ran down and opened the cell and died, the guy will still walk over and open the door even after your death. After that I made my way to the courtyard hugging the left wall. You will have to fight through a few mobs. If you have Consecration use that to easily kill the ghosts that spawn when you are cursed. Having decent gear also helps. The hardest part was taking out multiple elite mobs in SFK. One thing that helps is to pull them to the instance exit. Once you kill one of them run out, eat to restore your health and mana and go back in to fight the next one.","date":"2006-10-27T09:05:33-05:00","rating":70,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Definately a Super Weapon for the early stages of a Pallys career.

There is 20-22lvl elites in the start.i did it alone when i was 24lvl. just kill 1 and get the gem.then go back and complete the guest in AUBERDINE.\n\nthen you should have them all, i think :D\n\neasy guest if you don't wonder around the world and searching the gem in westfall.i tryied to tell the tips as basic as i can so everybody could understand.I hope that this helped some1.\n\nPS:plz dont judge my english, its my second language xD","date":"2006-06-11T17:20:54-05:00","rating":14,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"An excellent guide, except, you need to be wary of horde in BFD as well since it is in Ashenvale and it is contested.","creationdate":"2006-06-11T17:20:54-05:00","id":1166926,"rating":3,"commentid":2683137,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ThePotato","importedSubject":"Nice job"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Lejas","importedSubject":"Verigan's Fist for dummies"},{"commentv2":1,"number":23,"id":2683163,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"I just got it, and its amazing, the weapon speed could be better, but it far outshines gargoyles bite, normal weapon damage is in the mid 100's... can't wait to get into the battle grounds with it.","date":"2006-07-18T05:20:54-05:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Wonder if Horde Paladins will be able to get this.

You'll probably need a health pot to kill him, but he really isnt that tough without his adds. The rest of SFK is just about controlling your adds; with half-decent gear you can take on two Worgen, kill one and then bubble up and heal, then kill the other.

I just have to say that having this weapon makes a huge difference for a paladin. I was soloing level 30 mobs at 25 with it. I was level 23 when I completed the quest by the way. \n\nThe quest starts out in the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind. You get sent to Westfall to help a Mrs. Stilwell fight off some raiders. This part is easily soloable if you have a decent weapon (like the 2hander from redridge Tharil Zun) and the 22 holy light. Alternately you can wait for another paladin to wander through and duo it if you get beat down. It involves killing 3 waves of between 3 and 5 level 18 raiders that rush down to kill Stilwell. She helps a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. \n\nAfter you complete this you get sent to Ironforge to talk to her hubby. He gives you a list of 4 items to get and he'll give you a \"weapon\". This is verigans fist. \n\n1. Jordans Refined Ore. \n\nLocation - northwest Loch Modan. In thelsamar you talk to a miner who tells you where to find it. It is in the Mo'Grosh Ogre stronghold at the back behind a tree. It is not in a cave or anything. Just wait for it to be cleared by the groups here or clear yourself. The Ogres can be soloed so not really a big deal. Loot, return to miner in Thelsamar and turn in. Fin. \n\n2. Kor Gem \n\nIn Auberdine across the ocean there is a quest giver named Windweaver something or another that gives this quest. Get the quest then run south into Ashenvale to Blackfathom depths. The naga in here are soloable and have a decent chance of dropping the Corrupted gem you need to turn in. Grab a second person to make the fights go faster if you want. I didn't and got it in about 30 minutes. Run back to Auberdine and turn in. Fin. \n\n3. Jordans Smithing Hammer \n\nThis is probly the hardest part that is soloable. Shadowfang Keep is located in Silver Pine forest which is northwest of wetlands across Arathi Highlands. Note on the run there. There are several places along the road where you can get agro from level 30+ mobs when running through Arathi. Shield and run on if you get agro. You can time your run passed them so you don't get agro if you are careful. There is also a patrol of skull level undead that wander this road. Leave the road and let them pass. \n\nOnce you get to Shadowfang if you don't have a group you are in for some fun. I was stumped for a while lfg to open the courtyard door. You can take 2 of the mobs in here ok if you shileld\/heal and are careful. It's a pretty nasty fight though when you do get 2. The person that opens ths courtyard door is in a cell behind a solid 4 mob pull. Almost impossible for a 20 something paladin to solo. The mobs are all 18-20 elites. Fortunately you don't have to kill any mob in that 4 pull to open the courtyard. Heres how. \n\nYou can reach the lever to open the door from the top of the ledge above the 4 pull without agro. Once the door is open make sure both shields are refreshed. No repops so don't get hasty. Once they are refreshed shield 1 and immediately run into the room. Talk to the guy. Say \"open the door\" or whatever then book it for the entrance of the instance. Zone out. At this point you should have 3-4 mobs behind you waiting inside. They WILL be there when you zone back in. All is not lost though. Let your shield refresh and zone back in. 3-4 mobs will immediately attack you. Pop shield immediately, run into the next room and whatever your target is nail him with Hammer of Justice. Zone back out. The mob you stunned will return to spawn and you have 1 less to deal with then you zone back in. Let everything refresh, rinse and repeat until you have an easily soloable single mob in there. Kill it and wander upstairs. Courtyard door is now open. Kill the mobs along the left hand wall, should only be a single 2 pull. \n\nLoot hammer and hearth out. Congrats. You just soloed a hell of a quest piece. \n\n4. Whitestone lumber. \n\nJust grab a VC group in deadmines and loot it. No biggie here. \n\nReturn to Stilwell outside of Ironforge and turn in. He makes your hammer and you are done. Congrats. Go beat down some mobs several levels above you.

After the \"maiden rescue\" mission (not too hard) I joined an SFK group to get the first item, which is NOT on a log but just lying there on a crate just inside the stable area.  I joined another group for the Deadmines portion, no big deal.\n\nThe third part I did was the ogres -- get the generic ogre quest in Loch Modan while you're at it (killing four of three different kinds).  You don't have to enter any of the caves for the pally quest; the crate you're looking for is in one of the camps, easily located (there were some multiboxers there who killed the three mobs for me; all I had to do was run up and grab it).  Ran back to Loch Modan for the turn-in and that wrapped up the third bit.\n\nThe fourth in the tunnel leading to the BFD instance was actually a little more challenging; I had to kill 9-10 mobs until the gem dropped.  There's a \"rogue\" patroller who can pop up while you're fighting one of his friends so try to tackle him by himself, he can be detected if you're close enough to him.  Spellcasters further in should be line-of-sight (LOS)-pulled around the corner to separate them from their friends (body-pull or explosives\/rockets from an earlier Elwynn Forest quest).  Then I ran back to Darkshore for the turn in, then hearthed back to Ironforge for the final turn in and the reward, which also pushed me to level 22.\n\nI played a pure Retribution Paladin with Seal of Command, an uncommon level 20 two-hander with a dinky +2 damage enchantment, decent \"greens\" for armor (including all the uncommon mail you can build from the Blacksmith trainer plans), also lightly enchanted\/light-armor kitted, and just enough Engineering for Rough Dynamite for pulling\/AOE damage against multiple mobs.  Expendables used were Minor\/Lesser Healing potions, Minor Mana potions, Rough Weightstones, and low-level food to increase Stamina\/Spirit.

Have food for buffs, have water and most importantly, HAVE A GOOD WEAPON.\r\nI was Holy specced at this moment for Consecration which you will not be using either way, so you DO NOT need to have Seal of Command. A decent green with 18-19 DPS is more than enough. I personally was using Rakzur Club (18.3 DPS) and got by just fine. I can not stress how important a good weapon is, so don't go into this with a 10 DPS one-hand and a shield.\r\n\r\n[b]\r\n=======================================\r\nThe Whitestone Oak Lumber (Deadmines Solo)\r\n=======================================\r\n[\/b]\r\nI would consider this one to be the hardest, and I certainly recommend obtaining the quest early and doing it with a group, or having a friend help you. However, that's not what this post is about. We're here to solo it on Hardcore.\r\n\r\nFirstly, clear mostly everything leading up to the boss. You don't need to clear everything, mostly as that would be a waste of time (also be aware of respawn timer). Just enough so that you are able to cleanly run back to the entrance and zone out, should you need it. I advise taking it slow, and a good strategy for the Flamestrike-spamming Evokers is to move, and line of sight them. When they cast Flamestrike, it casts to where you stood when the cast begun, so by moving roughly 15-20 yards away from that spot you won't get hit at all, and moving out of LoS will ensure they won't immediately cast it again.\r\n\r\nThe hardest part of Deadmines Solo is the first boss, Rhahk'zor. He has roughly 4.5K health and hits for nearly 100 per auto attack. He can be especially deadly as he will knock you down which interrupts your heals, and he can easily crit you for 200 damage sending you right back to Elwynn Forest.\r\nHe has two guards, but these will not be important as we won't be fighting them at the same time.\r\n\r\nMy number 1 tip for this boss is to use Blessing of Wisdom. The mana sustain is incredibly important and will ensure your survival. This fight takes a while, and without it you will be out of mana before he even reaches 75%.\r\n\r\nWhen pulling him, make sure that he has patrolled as far away from the locked door as possible (towards you). If he is as far up as he can be, and you pull him with a careful Judgement, you won't aggro the two guards making this kill... actually possible. Once you're fighting him just make sure to heal yourself often (only with Holy Light) and get a few swings in here and there. As long as you keep yourself alive, he will eventually die.\r\n\r\nOnce he's dead, make sure to kill the patrol coming from behind before you pull the two guards and you will be just fine.\r\n\r\nOnce you're at the lumber room (the room with Sneed's Shredder), pull the first goblin to your left and you should get the lumber first kill. If not, try to pull a different one that you can get alone. The goblins attack very fast, making it incredibly hard to get a heal off if there are two of them on you, but it's not impossible. I pulled two myself and came out unscathed.\r\n\r\n[b]\r\n===========================================\r\nJordan's Smithing Hammer (Shadowfang Keep Solo)\r\n===========================================[\/b]\r\n\r\nThis one was honestly the easier of the two instances. It did require almost always pulling two mobs at a time, whereas with Deadmines you usually only have to pull one, but Shadowfang Keep doesn't require you to kill any bosses.\r\n\r\nFor every pull leading up to the first boss and the locked door to the courtyard, you will have 1 worgen \"Whitescalp\" and 1 worg. What's important to note here, is that the Whitescalp has Frost Armor which slows your attack speed and cast speed, and the Worg has a magic debuff which also slows your attack and cast speed. YOU MUST kill the Worg first, and then the Whitescalp, otherwise these two debuffs stack and suddenly your attacks and casts take twice as long and you're likely dead.\r\n\r\nAll packs leading to the boss are identical, always containing 1 of each of these, so it's just a simple rinse and repeat strategy. There can be times where you can manage to pull only one of each.\r\n\r\nOnce you're at Rethilgore, the first boss, you want to just jump down with a YOLO attitude. As there are 3 other mobs by the boss who will guaranteed pull, you can not solo kill these. Other strategies for this boss includes: dying. Not recommended.\r\n\r\nWhen you jump down you want to make sure that you land by the middle gate and lever. Pull the lever as fast as you can and talk to the Sorcerer inside the cell to make him open the gate. Once you've spoken to him, and ONLY then, may you pop Divine Protection and book it back out of the instance. Be sure to jump over the railing back at the first room to get down, as it forces the mobs to take a longer route to get to you. Once outside, make sure you aren't in combat before re entering.\r\n\r\nThis leads you to the courtyard which is far easier to manage. Pull carefully on the left side and pull all the mobs back up the staircase. The Worgens in this area will cast an anti-magic shell, so I advise to just use Seal of the Crusader here for damage output. While they're casting anti-magic shell, it gives you a perfect opportunity to cast a heal on yourself. Overall very easy to deal with. Clear down to the stable and then loot your hammer. DO NOT pull the horses.\r\n\r\n[b]\r\n===\r\nGG\r\n===[\/b]","date":"2023-09-24T06:56:40-05:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Check this vid: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JkO9QewOEGw There's also an evade spot above Rethilgore on some crates.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5016</b></h3>There are 4 parts to the quest to get this. The first is to collect the wood from Deadmines. Usually it is easy to find a group and I doubt this is soloable in the low 20s. For the next part you have to pick up some ore in the elite ogre area in Loch Modan. This is very easy to do solo, you will probably only have to fight a few of the ogres to get to the ore which is sitting there right in the open. The next part is to collect a corrupted Kor gem. This can be obtained in BFD and it drops off Naga mobs. You don't even have to go inside the instance, just kill some of the Naga outside the instance until it drops. Finally it's best to save SFK for last as it is the hardest one to solo. I solo'd this at level 22. I fought my way to the room where the guy is held captive in the cell. At this point I ran down and opened the cell and died, the guy will still walk over and open the door even after your death. After that I made my way to the courtyard hugging the left wall. You will have to fight through a few mobs. If you have Consecration use that to easily kill the ghosts that spawn when you are cursed. Having decent gear also helps. The hardest part was taking out multiple elite mobs in SFK. One thing that helps is to pull them to the instance exit. Once you kill one of them run out, eat to restore your health and mana and go back in to fight the next one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7901</b></h3>This is by far one of the best quest weapons in the game pre 60.<br />As it provides the more benefit for the longest period of time. So congratulations paladins. you've reached level 22 and your ready to start your Quest towards Verigan's Fist.<br /><br />The quest starts from the Cathedral in Stormwind City.<br />Duthorian Rall will give you the Tomb of Valor, which asks you to help out a poor farmer in Westfall defend her farm against a Defias Raiding Party. <br /><br />Off you run to Daphne Stilwell, who's farm is located near the exit point of The Deadmine's Instance.<br /><br />Once you locate her she will ask you if you are ready to help her defend her farm. Accept and waves of defias bandits will begin comings. 1st Wave = 3 Bandits, 2nd Wave= 4 Bandits, 3rd Wave = 5 Bandits. <br />Afterwhich should you be successful she will send you back to the Cathedral in Stormwind City to speak to Duthorian Rall.<br /><br />He will then give you Test of Righteousness. And send you to speak to Jordan Stilwell outside the Ironforge Gates.<br /><br />Jordan Stilwell will give you a list of items he requires to forge a mighty weapon ( Verigan's Fist ).<br /><br />Whitestone Oak Lumber - Drops of the Goblin Woodcarvers in Deadmines instance.<br /><br />Jordan's Refined Ore Shipment.<br />This you have to go to Loch Modan, and talk to Bailor Stonehand BEFORE you go and find the crate or you will not be able to loot it. The crate is then located in the NW part of Loch Modan just outside one of the ogre caves.<br /><br />Jordan's Smithing Hammer.<br />This is found in the stable area of Shadowfang Keep. Its extremely hard to solo at level 22 so if you attempt it at this level then you should bring help. Pretty straight forward to find.<br /><br />Purified Kor Gem.<br />You must first talk to Thundris Windweaver in Auberdine, Darkshore. Then he sends you to go to Blackfathom Deeps to kill the naga in the tunnel before the instance entrance. Any of the elite naga will do, they will drop a Corrupted Kor Gem, which you bring back to Thundris and he will give you the Purified Version.<br /><br />Bring back all those items to Jordan Stilwell and he will craft Verigan's Fist.<br /><br />Good Luck to you Paladins.!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7930</b></h3>Must have for all pally's as they level, not only is it a good weapon but the xp is great too. i used verigan until mid 30's then used frostblade until i got Witchfury at 39. SFK is possible to solo, you may die a few times but as long as you get back before the instance resets, your in good shape. hardest part is at the cells. i was able to jump over the stairs into the little space there to draw out one and then you have to take on the others at one time. after that, its not too bad, you just have to make it to the stable across the courtyard</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>47175</b></h3>Lol @ previous comment, where else would you use this weapon if not in WoW?!?<br /><br />But yeah, love this mace, getting it at lvl20 is awesome, no other 2hander comes close to matching this at that level. Very long winded the quest though, took me forever to trek around to all the instances...luckily I had a lvl70 warlock with me and we had a great time even with all the travelling about and when its finally done the sense of achievement is so much more than if you had just got a weapon from the AH.<br /><br />So enjoy this quest guys, wish there were more long drawn out quests like this, with a really nice reward at the end of it of course.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ookluh</b></h3>Definitely a viable weapon until the early 40s, at which point it's still basically equivalent to the greens you'll find at that level (for those of us who have this as our first toon and can't always afford all the blues). The earlier you can get it, the better.. though you'll most likely need help in some areas. I had trouble soloing SFK at 27 (though I eventually did), though apparently it can be done sooner.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well there seems to be a little bit of confusion and i cbf reading all the posts above so heres wat i did<br />first of all....you must have completed the previous quests ie. the one where you have to protect that chick in westfall froim the waves of defias<br />then you get this quest<br />i did this at lvl 22 or something with another paladin<br />so first:<br />loch modan...if you haven't been there then your silly but yes its in mo'grosh stronghold IT IS NOT A DROP so killing everything will get you nothing but xp and prove the soloing ownage of the paladin but thats a different story<br />it is a CRATE near a tree in the middle area of the compound (i think can't recall precisely) so just mouse over anything, it is a brown box so just search around and you'll find it, this is probably the bit people have most trouble with so dont stress, maybe do the chok sul and mercenaries quests from town while you're at it<br /><br />then off we go to deadmines <br />groups are easy as hell to get so yeah just get one and either go for the whole thing if you need items or drop out after the goblins, it dropped first goblin for me so yeah not hard to get at all <br /><br />then shadowfang keep<br />this is the biggest !@#$% to get to coz you'll most likely have to run all the way from loch modan or menethil harbour(this is when num lock for auto run is useful)<br />anyway run along and either have another paladin like me or if you're extra lucky find a hunter friend lvl 40 or above who can aspect of the pack and protect you to get there a helluva lot easier :)and faster<br />or you can get a shadowfang group obviously and its impossible to go wrong to get there although i've been there once and it was very confusing after the courtyard with the hammer<br />so yeah get ur way to shadowfang (in tirisfal glades for all you who dont know) and go foward, rescue some mage guy and into the courtyard where excorcism comes in handy :)<br />and its in the stables<br />if you have a high lvl friend or a group kill the horses to get a 10 slot bag but dont otherwise<br />on a crate, theres a screenshot of where it is somewhere around so yeah easy as pie<br /><br />blackfathom deeps or w/e<br />easy to get to..menethil: should have been there by now so take the boat (right pier) and then to auberdine <br />then get down into ashenvale (south) and after you enter make a right or west (coz ur coming from the north) when u can and u will find a path like thing<br />its easy enough to get to, just ask some of the locals if you're having difficulty<br />and from recollection there is a quest in auberdine which gets you some nice mail bracers which is very easy to do so thats a good pickup<br />so yeah just kill some things in outside the instance and it should drop <br />and before you head off make sure you get the quest from the guy in the house just left of the inn where the pier goes into so you can get the gem lol and return it once found to get it enchanted<br />then back to ironforge with an excited expression and get your very brand new nice ownage weapon and then get it replaced in gnomer :)<br />best weapon in the game considering its level, nothing at that stage can beat it i dont think<br />so yeah thats about it<br />if you wanna start a paladin go on stormreaver and whisper Arantalin (thats me) of Sorrow (great tabard) and ill come and help you grow into a nice big paladin who kills lots of smelly horde<br />happy hunting<br />pallies ftw!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this mace when I did the paladin quest at level 21 and I must say it served me well. I used it until level 39, because I couldn't find anything better. Every paladin should get it as soon as they can do the quest.<br /><br />The quest line, was fun and moderately easy. <br /><br />- The ogres in Loch Modan weren't hard to kill and the crate sits outside near a tree in the compound.<br /><br />- Lumber from Deadmines was a piece of cake, just find a deadmines group, get to the goblins and one of them will drop the lumber. You can do this quest along with all the other DM quests so you don't have to keep running DM over and over again.<br /><br />- The gem from BFD was a bit harder. You can kill the naga just outside the instance (below the ground in the caves) and one will drop the gem. While the naga were tough for me at level 21, my 3rd kill dropped the gem.<br /><br />- The toughest part was finding a group for Shadowfang Keep, so I finally had a level 60 guildmate run me through to the stables. <br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the quest and got this great weapon, I highly recommend all Paladins getting it as soon as you hit early 20's. Like I said, I had it until 39 and loved it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With out this weapon a low lvl pally will never be able to see how good the pally has gotten. For example if a pally is lvl 20 and has verigans fist and has gone down the retribution tree he would have the opportunity to use seal of command which would boast the damage effects on npcs and in pvp and that is one of the main reasons why pally's are donomaint in pvp between lvls 20-29.With seeing the effects of the masly 10 pionts in one tree can boast the effectiveness of a pally,a pally at lvl 40 should have Blessing of kings (protection), Seal of command (retribution), and Consencration (holy). With all these and a decent blue weapon a pally would be a unstoppable force in pvp. Thus making the best pvp tree for lvl 40. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is an ideal weapon for Holy or Retribution paladins from 22-30 and very nice for Protection Paladins to have available.&nbsp; It is excellent for DPS, healing, or offtanking.&nbsp; Its stat benefits&nbsp; make it a decent choice even over Aku'mai's sword from BFD and even Thermaplugg's Arm from Gnomeregan.&nbsp; It is still very useful to Protection paladins in the 22-30 range if your 1h/shield set is lagging and you are unable to hold aggro.&nbsp; However, Prot Paladins should be investing more heavily in a good shield and 1-hand weapon.<br /><br />After level 30, it is still good for all paladins have Verigan's Fist in the bank for the purpose of backup healing.&nbsp; Until you can get access to +Healing weapons/items from RFK and SM, hold onto this mace for the +INT benefits.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im lvl 29 and havent done the q because 1; i; too lazy and 2; since i got a rare wpn tht does more dmg then fist and has a effect, no xtra spirit, stamina , etc though. So i dont really see the point of doing it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>(from easiest to hardest)<br /><br />Lumber- really easy, you just go into the Deadmines in Westfall and it will drop from one of the goblins in the goblin shredder room.<br /><br />Ore- Also easy, you go to Loch Modan-Thelsamar by griffin or walk there from Kharanos. You speak with the dwarf(entering thelsamar, the 2nd house on the left), and he gives u the quest thing and then you run/swim across the loch to get to the Mo'grosh Ogre Compound. Once there, you kill the first 4 or 5 ogres in the way and there should be a box laying beside a large tree. The golden wheel will appear, so click on it and get it. Depending on you level, u should probably have a companion with you. <br /><br />Kor Gem- this is not the hardest one, but it takes forever to get there. You walk through the Wetlands to Menethil Harbor(you should see signs on the way). Once there you go on the ship docked there going to Auberdine, Darkshore. FIRST, YOU HAVE TO TALK WITH THUNDRIS WINDREAVER IN AUBERDINE OR ELSE THE GEM WILL NOT DROP!(many people forget this and become very frustrated.)You then walk south down the beach or down the trail. You should see the meeting stone for BFD and a bunch of ruins. You walk into one of the ruined areas down the steps and in the water. Swim down and across and kill the npc's u see in the tunnel. <br />You should get the Gem dropped on the 1st or second drop.Then take it back to Thundris in auberdine, and he'll purify it for you.(You'll want a partner with you on this one probably over lvl 30 to help u out.<br /><br />Smithing Hammer- You go through the wetlands past arathi and find a high lvl to help you. (lvl 40+) They'll take you to the Shadow Fang Keep and the hammer should drop&nbsp; within 10 minutes into it. The drop is next to 3 horses in their sheds. Unless you're a rogue(it's a pally quest) and you can stealth past guys, youll defenitely need a compaanion. <br /><br />That's it.<br />It'll take a while and a lot of patience, but it is defenitely worth it in the end. Upon completion of getting the items just fly back to IF outside of the front(where many people duel) and you'll see him there.<br />Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i now have the fist in my hands and it took like 5-7h to get it.its great pally weapon indeed 25dps and with seal of command it makes nice holes to my enemies.so i started to get it 24lvl and i get it in 25.it's not that hard to do.here is some tips for those 4 items.<br /><br /> 1/4 the whitestone oak lumber:&quot;GROUP&quot; just get some group to DEADMINES with you.at there, the woodroom where is the robot boss you just kill those elite-goblins. the lumber should drop of the first 3 goblin,no need to rekill this room.<br /><br />2/4 Jordan's refined ore shipment:&quot;ALONE&quot; you have to talk to the dwarf (Bailor Stonehand) in THELSAMAR to get the quest. Then, you swim across the lake to the MO 'GROSH STRONGHOLD.there is 20-22lvl elite mobs so be carefull if you are lower than 22lvl . Near the cave entrance there is 2-3 boxes next to the tree.1 of those is the shipment.<br /><br />3/4 Jordan's smithing hammer:&quot;GROUP&quot; this is the tricky 1 because the SAHDOWFANG KEEP instance is on horde territory. you could go alone there (18-20lvl elites), but i got killed there many times because all those nice and lovely hordes just didnt felt comfterful that i walked there. So, bring some friends whith you. i did it with 33lvl pally easily.in the instance there is these humanoids with theyr wolfs.just kill the wolf first and then focus on the humanoid.you soon realize that the main gate is closed,so go to the little door near the gate and there should be a prison. so kill the humanoid who guars the prisoners,heal,get mana, and then open the cells.first 1 of the cells got undead boss (24lvl if i remember correctly) and he is a badass.just kill him quick and move to the last cell.there is another humanoid but not boss.then at the middle,there is a mage who will open the door for you if you talk to him.as soon as you open the door you will see huge mass of elite humanoids.just go agenst the wall and you should fight just 2-3 of them.atlast there is the stables, 1 humanoid inside and then in the middle the hammer is on the box.but just 1 more thing:DONT ATTACK THE STABLE HORSES! if you do, they all attack you and you WILL die.<br /><br />4/4 Purified Kor Gem:&quot;ALONE&quot; this 1 is on night elf land,so take a boat-trip to there.you arrive in AUBERDINE where you must talk the THUNDRIS WINDWEAWER to get the guest. then, find you way to the BLACKFATHOM DEEPS. There is 20-22lvl elites in the start.i did it alone when i was 24lvl. just kill 1 and get the gem.then go back and complete the guest in AUBERDINE.<br /><br />then you should have them all, i think :D<br /><br />easy guest if you don't wonder around the world and searching the gem in westfall.i tryied to tell the tips as basic as i can so everybody could understand.I hope that this helped some1.<br /><br />PS:plz dont judge my english, its my second language xD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just got it, and its amazing, the weapon speed could be better, but it far outshines gargoyles bite, normal weapon damage is in the mid 100's... can't wait to get into the battle grounds with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was able to solo Jordan�s Hammer in Shadowfang Keep fairly easily at lvl25.&nbsp; I�m sure that using this technique lower levels could do it as well.&nbsp; But no lower than level 23.&nbsp; I did this PvE.&nbsp; I know that PvP there are going to be other complications (like getting there safely) so maybe those people will still need help.<br /><br />Here�s how:<br /><br />First clear the building you start in.&nbsp; If you are careful you should not be fighting more than 2 enemies at any one time.&nbsp; They are levels 18-20.&nbsp; Take your time.&nbsp; Practicing is easy since this task is the first in the instance and you can get easily get your equipment patched-up next door in Pyrewood for another try (but it is a long way to come from the cemetery). Free the prisoner who then unlocks the door.&nbsp; Go to the doorway and look out.&nbsp; No-one will attack you.<br /><br />You will see the stables directly across from you.&nbsp; There are 3 archway entrances.&nbsp; In between the courtyard is full of bad guys and it looks impossible to fight your way through.&nbsp; Here�s the trick. You have been to the AH and bought yourself Lesser Invisibility Potion. You must be level 23 to use this.&nbsp; It will give you 15 seconds of invisibility. In 15 seconds you can run clear across the courtyard and into the rightmost archway.&nbsp; Go into the back corner and spin around.&nbsp; As you reappear you may pull a single nearby attacker.&nbsp; Take him down.<br /><br />The box containing Jordan�s hammer should be in view.&nbsp; This is a one-way trip.&nbsp; Get the hammer and hearth-out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I solo'd this entire thing between lvl22 and lvl24 except Deadmines (but who has a problem getting a DM group?), not difficult at all if you do SFK last. The only hard part to solo is Rethilgore in SFK, but all you do is pull him to the instance gate and then zone out. Zone back in, kill one of his adds (2H DPS required) and zone out. You'll probably need a health pot to kill him, but he really isnt that tough without his adds. The rest of SFK is just about controlling your adds; with half-decent gear you can take on two Worgen, kill one and then bubble up and heal, then kill the other. It is possible, and it isnt hard, just concentrate and be *very* aware of aggro radius. If things go @#$%-up make sure you know your escape route, because if you die it's a long walk from Southshore.<br /><br />With regards the weapon itself, it is perfect for any Paladin; even Prot Paladins need DPS to level, and this weapon provides enough of that to last beyond lvl30. It's better IMO for Ret-specs because of the high max damage, but no Paladin should miss getting the Fist.</div>

The human female mobs, I think it was a Haunted Servitor, casted a curse on me which would last 8 mins and pop an undead level 20 mob(Haunted Spirit) every like 1 min (only 50hp on them).

Got myself a Hellslayer Battle axe and, sadly, had to sell the mace... the bloddy merchant only pays 74s for it.<br />My advice is get it as early as possible and there will be no need to upgrade until ur lvl 35. When I was lvl 34 I used it to beat tha crap out of lvl's 35-38 and even some 39's... we were fantastic toghether (cries)... of course having Seal Of Command did help a lot.<br />Trust me, its worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Poached from <a href="https://www.graffe.com/forums" rel="nofollow">www.graffe.com/forums</a> written by klietus <br /><br />Just thought I'd share my experience as it is kinda unusual and might be useful for other pally's out there. <br /><br />So the quest was my level 20 hammer, Verigans Fist. I just have to say that having this weapon makes a huge difference for a paladin. I was soloing level 30 mobs at 25 with it. I was level 23 when I completed the quest by the way. <br /><br />The quest starts out in the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind. You get sent to Westfall to help a Mrs. Stilwell fight off some raiders. This part is easily soloable if you have a decent weapon (like the 2hander from redridge Tharil Zun) and the 22 holy light. Alternately you can wait for another paladin to wander through and duo it if you get beat down. It involves killing 3 waves of between 3 and 5 level 18 raiders that rush down to kill Stilwell. She helps a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. <br /><br />After you complete this you get sent to Ironforge to talk to her hubby. He gives you a list of 4 items to get and he'll give you a &quot;weapon&quot;. This is verigans fist. <br /><br />1. Jordans Refined Ore. <br /><br />Location - northwest Loch Modan. In thelsamar you talk to a miner who tells you where to find it. It is in the Mo'Grosh Ogre stronghold at the back behind a tree. It is not in a cave or anything. Just wait for it to be cleared by the groups here or clear yourself. The Ogres can be soloed so not really a big deal. Loot, return to miner in Thelsamar and turn in. Fin. <br /><br />2. Kor Gem <br /><br />In Auberdine across the ocean there is a quest giver named Windweaver something or another that gives this quest. Get the quest then run south into Ashenvale to Blackfathom depths. The naga in here are soloable and have a decent chance of dropping the Corrupted gem you need to turn in. Grab a second person to make the fights go faster if you want. I didn't and got it in about 30 minutes. Run back to Auberdine and turn in. Fin. <br /><br />3. Jordans Smithing Hammer <br /><br />This is probly the hardest part that is soloable. Shadowfang Keep is located in Silver Pine forest which is northwest of wetlands across Arathi Highlands. Note on the run there. There are several places along the road where you can get agro from level 30+ mobs when running through Arathi. Shield and run on if you get agro. You can time your run passed them so you don't get agro if you are careful. There is also a patrol of skull level undead that wander this road. Leave the road and let them pass. <br /><br />Once you get to Shadowfang if you don't have a group you are in for some fun. I was stumped for a while lfg to open the courtyard door. You can take 2 of the mobs in here ok if you shileld/heal and are careful. It's a pretty nasty fight though when you do get 2. The person that opens ths courtyard door is in a cell behind a solid 4 mob pull. Almost impossible for a 20 something paladin to solo. The mobs are all 18-20 elites. Fortunately you don't have to kill any mob in that 4 pull to open the courtyard. Heres how. <br /><br />You can reach the lever to open the door from the top of the ledge above the 4 pull without agro. Once the door is open make sure both shields are refreshed. No repops so don't get hasty. Once they are refreshed shield 1 and immediately run into the room. Talk to the guy. Say &quot;open the door&quot; or whatever then book it for the entrance of the instance. Zone out. At this point you should have 3-4 mobs behind you waiting inside. They WILL be there when you zone back in. All is not lost though. Let your shield refresh and zone back in. 3-4 mobs will immediately attack you. Pop shield immediately, run into the next room and whatever your target is nail him with Hammer of Justice. Zone back out. The mob you stunned will return to spawn and you have 1 less to deal with then you zone back in. Let everything refresh, rinse and repeat until you have an easily soloable single mob in there. Kill it and wander upstairs. Courtyard door is now open. Kill the mobs along the left hand wall, should only be a single 2 pull. <br /><br />Loot hammer and hearth out. Congrats. You just soloed a hell of a quest piece. <br /><br />4. Whitestone lumber. <br /><br />Just grab a VC group in deadmines and loot it. No biggie here. <br /><br />Return to Stilwell outside of Ironforge and turn in. He makes your hammer and you are done. Congrats. Go beat down some mobs several levels above you. Solo a few dragons .. well .. the whelps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Finally got mine last night! Went to BTD with my lvl 34 rogue friend (I'm 24 btw =p) to get the Kor Gem. The toughest part of that was Ghamoo-ra, that big turtle mob. After that is when the Naga start poppin and the Gem dropped off the first one. After that we headed to SFK, this time it was the rogue and my other friend, a 35 mage. We swept though the zone fairly easily and got the smith hammer in the stables after the large courtyard. We decided to see how far we could get. We got to the end, wiped, came back in with more health pots and demolished the boss. My rogue friend got a Meteor Shard off of him. I also got a Phantom Armor drop off one of the mobs in the zone. <br /><br />Before we did that, days before actually, I did the other two parts quite easily. I went to DM (22 or 23 at the time) with my lvl 24-25 warlock friend. Single pulled our way down there pretty easily, only hard part was that ogre guard. After that, went all the was to Sneed's room where the gobbies are, wood dropped of the first one. The ore shipment was by far the easiest. Same party as DM, we went to Loch Moden, wandered through the ogre caves, I spotted some boxes on the ground, noticed one was clicky, and it was the ore. We killed only 3 or 4 ogres to get there and in all honesty, you really could get to that without drawing any ogres out to fight.<br /><br />And this hammer kicks some major dps butt! I can't wait to pwnz with this now!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Don't be like me and skip this Quest! You can use it from lvl 20 to almost into the mid 30's if you decide to keep it around. Its a mistake to not get this weapon, like me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I started the quest for this hammer at 23, and got it at level 24.<br /><br />Had help from a lv. 23 elf hunter with Daphne. Had the 23 elf hunter with me to get the Kor Gem.<br /><br />Ore quest. No biggie here. Lots of people to help you if want as well. There's a Wanted Poster Capture in this area. Get the quest in Thelsamar and earn a ring for your pinky while you're in the area.<br /><br />Just joined a group going into the dead mines to get the lumber. <br /><br />Hammer - As a lot of other people are saying - &quot;The Hammer was tricky&quot;. One, you have to run for what seems like days to get to this area. Then when you get there, you are in Horde territory, and there's not really any alliance members around Silverpine Forest to get help from. I tried soloing this, but too hard for a 23-24 when two elites are attacking you at a time. So, finally, I made Southshore in Hillsbrand Foothills my hometown. I asked for help for a bit. (not too hard to beg for help as this hammer is before the instance). A level 33 Paly who didn't even know about this Quest gave me a hand. He tanked and I served as healer, and I still wouldn't call it easy. But we both grabbed the hammer.<br /><br />I highly recommend stopping in Southshore while you are running to Silverpine. You have an inn you can hearth back to, and you can add it to your flightpath for future reference.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Haven't gotten it yet but I will try to get it as close to 20 as possible. But no way is it worth ussing past 28. A corpsemaker would crush that mace by then. Hit 28 and start doing RFK. Good luck getting a group together though most alliance avoid it like the plague for some reason. Opting for Gnomer or BFD.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KlausKerner</b></h3>For the renewed wow classic my story of getting this item:<br />1)Did the first part with protecting the girl from 3 waves of mobs at lvl 21 with a full group after running deadmines<br />turned the quest in, got sense undead and the nice shield - Bastion of Stormwind<br />2)Took the follow up which led to collecting the 4 items for the Hammer:<br /><br />-) ran deadmines to goblins (got the quest wood drop from 2nd gob) did it at lvl 21 as a tank was super easy, kept going up to smite and got the <a href="/classic/item=7230/smites-mighty-hammer">Smite's Mighty Hammer</a> drop too after 5 runs this was the first time I saw it drop ;) <br />-) next stop was thelsamar for the ore shipment, did it at lvl 21 (still) with my leveling partner that is a rogue, also did the 2 elite killquests Mercenaries, and the named ogre, he was a little bit harder as he came with 1 additional add, but we managed it by using all our cds<br />-) so now the hardest part, I thought, was shadowfang keep, but I got super lucky a warlock was looking for a tank for the dungeon, I got an invite even though being still lvl 21 at this point, so I was portet there right to the entrance ;) and dinged within the first couple mobs right before reaching the stables for the hammer... we finished the run (we were 3 paladins in the group btw :D) and I also got the shield from springvale (<a href="/classic/item=6320/commanders-crest">Commander's Crest</a>) and the sword from the butcher (<a href="/classic/item=6633/butchers-slicer">Butcher's Slicer</a>) *woohoo<br />-) so with lvl 22 smite's hammer and fully motivated I got to BFD and found out that only the naga's outside the instance drop the gem, killed a couple of the naga casters, 3x tide priestess(lvl 20 to 21) and 2x oracles (both lvl 22) each single pulls, it was easily doable with seal of the crusader judged and seal of command active, wait for HOJ cooldown and use it when they try to heal, to finish them off with SoC Judgement when they're stunned. The gem dropped by the 4th naga tide priestess, easy going<br /><br />only problem there were a horde party going into the instance chasing me off at first, but then a rogue got me when I ran up, so had to do 2 corpse runs, one bc of the rogue and 1 because there were respawn after I got the gem to get back outside. Returned to the questgiver to convert the gem and will do the turn in today in ironforge (had to log off bc was late yesterday) -&gt; one happy pally :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KnightTime</b></h3>These are the type of quests in Classic that make the game so much more fulfilling than what &quot;retail&quot; brings to the table.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Quineloe</b></h3>Whitestone Oak Lumber: <br />Drop from Woodcarvers Deadmines from Sneed's area. Trivial at level 20 due to large number of DM groups<br />Jordan's Ore Shipment: <br />Doable at level 20 with occasional groups for Mercenaries and Chok'Sul quests in Loch Modan<br />Jordan's Smithing Hammer: <br />Shadowfang Keep Stables, item pickup The hardest part since Alliance groups are hard to come by for a horde territory dungeon. Don't be a retrinoob diva, play healer or tank and LFM in Wetlands, right now there are enough players in that level range on classic. Later on you might wanna beg a 60 to help you. Otherwise level 24+ is a good time to attempt this.<br />Purified Kor Gem:<br />Drop from Naga in- and outside of BFD. Reasonably easy to solo at level 24. Groups more likely to get than SFK as well. <br /><br />result is an ilevel 31 weapon, essentially the Paladin's Whirlwind Axe if you get it early enough. At level 20 this weapon feels like an Epic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Serraphine</b></h3>I just finished soloing most of this quest at level 21 thanks to everyone's detailed instructions on here. I'd just like to add that while getting a group for the DM part is easier, it can be soloed if you can't find a group and want to get it over with. I soloed this part at level 22. The hardest part was the ogre boss and it was very close. I ended up using a greater healing potion, lay on hands, and a heavy wool bandage to get through it. I did have a Searing Blade with the fiery enchant, without which I don't think I could have pulled it off. My only other blue piece of gear were the pants you get for turning in VC's head. Everything else I was wearing were greens I bought off the AH. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gangfire</b></h3>I started the chain at early level 20. After the &quot;maiden rescue&quot; mission (not too hard) I joined an SFK group to get the first item, which is NOT on a log but just lying there on a crate just inside the stable area. I joined another group for the Deadmines portion, no big deal.<br /><br />The third part I did was the ogres -- get the generic ogre quest in Loch Modan while you're at it (killing four of three different kinds). You don't have to enter any of the caves for the pally quest; the crate you're looking for is in one of the camps, easily located (there were some multiboxers there who killed the three mobs for me; all I had to do was run up and grab it). Ran back to Loch Modan for the turn-in and that wrapped up the third bit.<br /><br />The fourth in the tunnel leading to the BFD instance was actually a little more challenging; I had to kill 9-10 mobs until the gem dropped. There's a &quot;rogue&quot; patroller who can pop up while you're fighting one of his friends so try to tackle him by himself, he can be detected if you're close enough to him. Spellcasters further in should be line-of-sight (LOS)-pulled around the corner to separate them from their friends (body-pull or explosives/rockets from an earlier Elwynn Forest quest). Then I ran back to Darkshore for the turn in, then hearthed back to Ironforge for the final turn in and the reward, which also pushed me to level 22.<br /><br />I played a pure Retribution Paladin with Seal of Command, an uncommon level 20 two-hander with a dinky +2 damage enchantment, decent &quot;greens&quot; for armor (including all the uncommon mail you can build from the Blacksmith trainer plans), also lightly enchanted/light-armor kitted, and just enough Engineering for Rough Dynamite for pulling/AOE damage against multiple mobs. Expendables used were Minor/Lesser Healing potions, Minor Mana potions, Rough Weightstones, and low-level food to increase Stamina/Spirit. It really helped in the final two parts to heal once or twice during each little battle. (I'm VERY glad I upgraded from the level-14 two-handed sword I previously had; I couldn't have done the last two parts without the level 20 uncommon weapon.)<br /><br />Verigan's Fist was a 23% DPS improvement from my level 20 green two-hander, and will beat almost any uncommon-quality weapon you might find until about level 33, at which point you want to start thinking about upgrading if you haven't found better already.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hyrhere</b></h3>Solo'd at level 25 in Hardcore Classic with relative ease!<br /><br />I won't be explaining the Kor Gem or the Ore Shipment as these two items are not a challenge to obtain even in the slightest, you should be able to solo these even at lower levels and they don't require going into an instance.<br /><br />But if you're like me and can't get a group for Deadmines (no one wanted an overleveled paladin, sadge) or Shadowfang Keep (Alliance L, no quests), then this guide is for you.<br /><br />Here's what you should do:<br /><br /><b>Prerequisites</b><br />Obviously I didn't go into this unprepared. Have food for buffs, have water and most importantly, HAVE A GOOD WEAPON.<br />I was Holy specced at this moment for Consecration which you will not be using either way, so you DO NOT need to have Seal of Command. A decent green with 18-19 DPS is more than enough. I personally was using Rakzur Club (18.3 DPS) and got by just fine. I can not stress how important a good weapon is, so don't go into this with a 10 DPS one-hand and a shield.<br /><br /><b><br />=======================================<br />The Whitestone Oak Lumber (Deadmines Solo)<br />=======================================<br /></b><br />I would consider this one to be the hardest, and I certainly recommend obtaining the quest early and doing it with a group, or having a friend help you. However, that's not what this post is about. We're here to solo it on Hardcore.<br /><br />Firstly, clear mostly everything leading up to the boss. You don't need to clear everything, mostly as that would be a waste of time (also be aware of respawn timer). Just enough so that you are able to cleanly run back to the entrance and zone out, should you need it. I advise taking it slow, and a good strategy for the Flamestrike-spamming Evokers is to move, and line of sight them. When they cast Flamestrike, it casts to where you stood when the cast begun, so by moving roughly 15-20 yards away from that spot you won't get hit at all, and moving out of LoS will ensure they won't immediately cast it again.<br /><br />The hardest part of Deadmines Solo is the first boss, Rhahk'zor. He has roughly 4.5K health and hits for nearly 100 per auto attack. He can be especially deadly as he will knock you down which interrupts your heals, and he can easily crit you for 200 damage sending you right back to Elwynn Forest.<br />He has two guards, but these will not be important as we won't be fighting them at the same time.<br /><br />My number 1 tip for this boss is to use Blessing of Wisdom. The mana sustain is incredibly important and will ensure your survival. This fight takes a while, and without it you will be out of mana before he even reaches 75%.<br /><br />When pulling him, make sure that he has patrolled as far away from the locked door as possible (towards you). If he is as far up as he can be, and you pull him with a careful Judgement, you won't aggro the two guards making this kill... actually possible. Once you're fighting him just make sure to heal yourself often (only with Holy Light) and get a few swings in here and there. As long as you keep yourself alive, he will eventually die.<br /><br />Once he's dead, make sure to kill the patrol coming from behind before you pull the two guards and you will be just fine.<br /><br />Once you're at the lumber room (the room with Sneed's Shredder), pull the first goblin to your left and you should get the lumber first kill. If not, try to pull a different one that you can get alone. The goblins attack very fast, making it incredibly hard to get a heal off if there are two of them on you, but it's not impossible. I pulled two myself and came out unscathed.<br /><br /><b><br />===========================================<br />Jordan's Smithing Hammer (Shadowfang Keep Solo)<br />===========================================</b><br /><br />This one was honestly the easier of the two instances. It did require almost always pulling two mobs at a time, whereas with Deadmines you usually only have to pull one, but Shadowfang Keep doesn't require you to kill any bosses.<br /><br />For every pull leading up to the first boss and the locked door to the courtyard, you will have 1 worgen &quot;Whitescalp&quot; and 1 worg. What's important to note here, is that the Whitescalp has Frost Armor which slows your attack speed and cast speed, and the Worg has a magic debuff which also slows your attack and cast speed. YOU MUST kill the Worg first, and then the Whitescalp, otherwise these two debuffs stack and suddenly your attacks and casts take twice as long and you're likely dead.<br /><br />All packs leading to the boss are identical, always containing 1 of each of these, so it's just a simple rinse and repeat strategy. There can be times where you can manage to pull only one of each.<br /><br />Once you're at Rethilgore, the first boss, you want to just jump down with a YOLO attitude. As there are 3 other mobs by the boss who will guaranteed pull, you can not solo kill these. Other strategies for this boss includes: dying. Not recommended.<br /><br />When you jump down you want to make sure that you land by the middle gate and lever. Pull the lever as fast as you can and talk to the Sorcerer inside the cell to make him open the gate. Once you've spoken to him, and ONLY then, may you pop Divine Protection and book it back out of the instance. Be sure to jump over the railing back at the first room to get down, as it forces the mobs to take a longer route to get to you. Once outside, make sure you aren't in combat before re entering.<br /><br />This leads you to the courtyard which is far easier to manage. Pull carefully on the left side and pull all the mobs back up the staircase. The Worgens in this area will cast an anti-magic shell, so I advise to just use Seal of the Crusader here for damage output. While they're casting anti-magic shell, it gives you a perfect opportunity to cast a heal on yourself. Overall very easy to deal with. Clear down to the stable and then loot your hammer. DO NOT pull the horses.<br /><br /><b><br />===<br />GG<br />===</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HeliosActual</b></h3>So I came on to WOTLK Classic this week and used my boost to make my paladin at 70; I don't have any desire to re-live BC, but I missed Wrath and was excited to jump in. And especially to be able to do a quick solo Verigan's Fist run--I love this quest, loved this weapon back in Vanilla.<br /><br />Lo and behold, it looks like my 70 boosted toon can't pick up the quest--the NPC doesn't have Tome of Valor for me. He DOES have the Charger quest (even though my chargers were given to me by Blizz's level boost). I submitted a ticket but haven't received a human response yet. Anybody else run into this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GamerGilgamesh</b></h3>Season of Discovery:<br /><br />This weapon is extremely good even at the level 25 cap. It is equivalent or better to the 2-Hand raid weapons for ret paladins. It is definitely worth it for quick leveling and level 25 content.<br /><br />I started the quest at level 20 and finished just after level 22 because you have to run DM and SFK. You also have to fight some elites in Loch Modan and near entrance to BFD dungeon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>keaticus1</b></h3>Awesome Paladin weapon for the level range you’re able to get it. Quick guide:<br /><br />1. At level 21 look for the blue ? In the cathedral of light in Stormwind and pick up the Tome of Valor quest. Then immediately speak with the same guy again to get Test of Righteousness. <br /><br />2. You will be sent to a farmhouse in deep Southwest of Westfall (just south of the Deadmines exit) and defend a woman from 3 waves of Defias. <br /><br />3. She will send you right outside Ironforge’s front gate to speak with Jordan Stilwell who wants to make you a reward mace by collecting 4 components. <br /><br />4. <br />For the ore you talk to a guy in Thelsamar, Loch Moran and he sends you to the ogres in the Northeast Loch Modan to pick up ore from a box. At level 25 I walked right past them all without aggroing any but be mindful they are ~18 elites. <br /><br />For the lumber it drops from the Goblins in the woodcutting area in Deadmines.<br /><br />For the gem you must speak to a night elf woman in Darkshore, Auberdine and then go down to Northwest Ashenvale and kill a couple naga to get the corrupted gem. Then take the gem back to the night elf woman to purify it.<br /><br />Lastly, the hammer is located in the stables in the courtyard of Shadowfang keep. You will have to kill Rethilgore (the first boss) and have the prisoner open the gate to reach the courtyard. <br /><br />Take all these things back to Jordan outside Ironforge gate and receive your mace!</div>
