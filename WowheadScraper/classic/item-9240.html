<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6710</b></h3>I wish this would count as a key but then again when do I ever go to ZF as a 60?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>djtez</b></h3>Once I had picked up the mallet from on top of the Altar of Zul I got three lv60's from my guild including a Warlock to run/ride up to the altar as they didn't aggro any of the mobs. They then summoned me and let me create the Mallet of Zul'Farrak. <br /><br />This saved a huge amount of time fighting all the way through Jintha'alor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Orik</b></h3>Bring a party, there are a lot of elites. As said, go to Jintha'Alor, this quest is extremely hard, but the reward is awesome. <br /><br />Jintha'alor is hard, so bring a good party.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7901</b></h3>Fairly easy to get, especially if you have stealth capabilities.<br />First you have to defeat the dual elite casters at the top of the Altar of Zul in The Hinterlands.<br /><br />At that point you will have the sacred mallet. which you then need to bring to the altar at the top of Jintha'alor. For a non stealther you will need a group or you could try your luck at mounting and running past all the mobs on the way up. For a stealther just stealth all the way to the altar. and you can generally stealth right up to the altar and use the hammer before you are hit by the 51 elite guardians.<br /><br />For a non stealther you might have a bit more issues using the hammer quickly and getting out of there. But one death is worth the hammer i believe.<br /><br />Good luck getting the hammer!<br /><br />Hammer is used to summon Gahz'rilla in Zul'Farrak for the Electrified Scale which yields you a Carrot on a Stick ( +3% mounted speed). <br /><br />Pretty Easy fight, just clear around the pool, and watch out for when he flings you into the air as it hurts coming down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3693</b></h3>Soloed this as a 52 mage, but could have done it a couple levels lower if I weren't so careful. Killing the two Keepers on the altar was easy once I figured out to use Greater Shadow Protection Potions, one for Qiaga and another for Morta'gya after I looted and popped the sheep. Stripped and rode all the way to the top of Jintha to the open area to the west right in front of the cave to Sharpbeak. Killed a few wolves to get close to the altar, then sheeped the elite right next to it while the priestess walked back into the cave. As long as you can handle an elite your level and somehow cc the elite for a few seconds (sap, freeze trap, seduce...) you should be able to pull it off.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>30936</b></h3>It may be the hardest quest that I have ever done. It was probably because we weren't careful, but I died close to 10 times.<br /><br />But it's worth it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lormus</b></h3>Soloable at 50+.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lollersk8r</b></h3>Soloed Qiaga and ran from the second for the mace as a 49 enh dw shaman. Clear the stairs and pull, keep grounding totem up and los as much as possible. Jumping onto the rail will los the two casters, took a while but it's doable with knowledge of how to los. As to the second part at Jintha'alor, just ride up and die until you make it to the altar, use the mallet, being hit doesn't cancel the cast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>45288</b></h3>Soloed as a 52 rogue.<br /><br />Killed Qiaga the Keeper and Morta'gya with Adrenaline Rush, Evasion, and Blade Flurry... <br /><br />Then stealthed to the altar at Jintha'alor, sapped the 51 elite named guardian, blessed the Mallet, vanished, walked a bit aways, and hearthed out.<br /><br />I did this while waiting to find the last person for the ZF group I was in.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Qiaga the Keeper drops it at the Altar of Zul in the Hinterlands. <br /><br />It says this : &quot;Use at the Jintha'Alor Altar to create the Mallet of Zul'Farrak.&quot;<br /><br />After that you have to go to Jintha Alor and use it on the altar there.<br /><br />Jintha Alor is just east of the Altar of Zul and it is a fairly large region with Elite trolls level 47-52 all over the place.<br /><br />You have to run trough a maze to get to the altar. Just go up whenever you can and you'll get there someday. If you have a cave entrance in front of you, don't go in ! Just turn around and go back a bit. This isn't the right place for this.<br /><br />The altar is just a big stone block in the middle of a &quot;coliseum/arena/staduim&quot;. There are wolves all around the place but only 1 troll close to the altar.<br /><br />Just sap the troll, use the mallet (it takes around 10 seconds), vanish and get out of there (on foot or with your Hearthstone).<br /><br />It takes a long time to sneak around these ruins but it still is a lot shorter to do it that way than assemble a party and kill everything.<br /><br />Besides, it is fun to do as a rogue. You can pickpocket over 100 guys on your way....and kill some too :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I read this from an &quot;ancient tablet&quot; that I got on a drop while in ZF. It said:<br /><br />&quot;The Mallet of Zul'Farrak<br /><br />To create the Mallet of Zul'Farrak, one must first travel to the Altar of Zul and Obtain the sacred mallet from a troll keeper.<br /><br />Next, one must bring the sacred mallet to the altar atop of the troll city of Jintha'Alor.<br />Using the sacred mallet at the altar will infuse it with power, and transform it into the Mallet of Zul'Farrak.&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Best part about this suicide run is that once you get to the top pof jintha'allor to enchant the mallet, the altar is surrounded by elites and the enchant has a 3 second cast time.<br /><br />heres the thing.<br /><br />damage doesnt interrupt the cast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If u are rogue, this is easy... stealth and go altar spot (tloc 59,77). Right timing is the key here. There is patrol and wolf in altar or nearby, when they leave, just sap that one Aman'zasi Guard, then use that mallet thing. Be sure that you stand on altar. After you have that Mallet of Zul'Farrak just vanish... <br /><br />sry my bad english :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soloed it as level 45 NE rogue! :)<br />(Elvorian, Grim Batol server)<br /><br />Went up to altar in stealth.<br />Waited till priestess hex go into cave..<br />Successful sapped guard near altar.<br />Made Mallet :) it has casting time about 5 sec to make it.. (same as Disenchant time I think) if you're alliance dont worry about troll lying on altar he won't attack you.<br />I was far enough from wolf so he didn't aggroed me :D<br />Vanished after (sap works on red mob so short&nbsp; so I got attacked after I made mallet ).<br /><br />Never died :D<br /><br />If you fail sapping mob try vanish and wait 5 min until CD go off and try again ;P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How to get this! First, go to the Hitherlands. Next, go atop the Alter of Zul. There should be 2 keepers. Keeper is in the name, it shouldn't be to hard to find them! There at the top. Kill one and loot a sacred mallet. Next, find your way to that HUGE troll city Jintha' somthing. (Also in Hitherlands! Look at map!) However you can, get to the very top, just keep looking for stairs and go up. There should be a boss girl around the center of the top floor. With an elite guard and dog.... However you can Jump on the little stone table and right click sacred mallet. The magic will enfuse it and it becomes Mallet of Zul'farrk! YAY! This mallet alows you to ring a gong in Zul' Farrk the instance and a boss comes out. Happy hunting!<br /><br />Real name: Nicole<br />Char Name: Erowin<br />server: Tichondruis<br />lvl: 48<br />Class: Night Elf<br />Guild: Gnomish Climbing League</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Mallet can be used over and over...no need to re-do the mallet quest ever.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>... is under <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2770">Gahz'rilla</a><br /><br />Use the Mallet to ring the gong at the deep end of the pool in Zul'Farrak and summon Gahz'rilla. Both Horde and Alliance can do this quest, which is obtainable on the Gnome side, at the Racetrack in Shimmering Flats, Thousand Needles.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Nov 25 02:07:37 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Easiest way of course is to just stealth up to the altar carefully passing all guards. When you reach the altar there is one elite that stands right in front of it and Hexx. Thankfully Hexx takes a walk and gets far enough for you to sap the guard, use the mallet and vanish out of there. Very easy doesn't quite covers it. Actually the hardest part is moving at 35% the speed around a big city as Jintha'Alor :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>how do u do this quest?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How can i get The mallet where dos the quest begins</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you go to zul'farrak or whatever its spelled, and you right click it and click on the gong.. then a lizard comes out</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There's enough help already on getting the Sacred Mallet from Qiaga the Keeper. The more extremely difficult part is using it to create the Mallet of Zul'Farrak itself. <br /><br />Now, you can fight your way through the troll city, or you can do things the easy way. Have you and your party members (you'll need at least one other person with you), remove all of your items with durability (everything but necklesses, trinkets, etc.). Get on your mount (you can mount inside the city), and just run up to the top. After exploring a little you should find the altar, which is in an outdoor auditorium of sorts with a cave behind it. At the entrance to the cave is Priestess Hexx. On the altar itself is a Horde NPC. Now, once you find this area, just let the mobs of the area kill you. After you run back to your corpse, have your friend respawn and gain agro from all the nearby enemies, then respawn and stand in front of the altar and right click the Sacred Mallet in your inventory. Wallah! You have the Mallet of Zul'Farrak. Then you can just repeat the process for the person who took the hits for you. Gahz'rilla awaits!<br /><br />Oh, and there is no quest for this. Just find and fight Qiaga the Keeper and the Sacred Mallet will drop (everytime I believe, and can be picked up by all party members from one corpse). Then take it to the troll city, as previously mentioned.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Feb 25 03:42:49 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just did it and it's not real difficult if your a rogue with Master of Deception. You have to walk 5 flights of stairs. Lot of 46-48 elites along with non-elite dogs that you have to watch for. when you get to the top of the last flight of stairs hang a LEFT and go into an outdoor colliseum. Get up close and wait. When hexx walks away sap the elite by the altar. Make your mallet and fade away.<br /><br />If you do not have stealth. Then either do a Leroy to the top floor and run back to your body to rez or get a good group and fight your way there.<br /><br />All this #$%^ for a &quot;Carrot on the stick&quot;. No wonder no one wants to get the dang thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just did this today with my 45 Warrior, solo.<br /><br />Did a nekkid corpse run to the alter, took another death there. Backed up to a safe spot to rez, equipped my tanking gear and then bandaged myself back up to full health. From there, I ran at the alter in defensive stance and popped shield wall.<br /><br />The mallet only takes about two seconds to channel and isn't interrupted if you get hit. Granted I died after shield wall fell. Took a spirit rez and hearthed.<br /><br />Getting the actual Sacred Mallet was a different story though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>That was a perfect guide, takes a times dying and such to get all the way to the altar. Took I'd guess ten minutes with the dying and running. Just make sure every time you rez, its in a safe place where you can heal up...and mount up.<br /><br />Just a few side notes...the Colliseum is the top-left portion of Jin (if you were facing it head on.) You need to be actually standing on the lower portion of the altar, can't just be near it.<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">The mallet only takes about two seconds to channel and isn't interrupted if you get hit</div><br /><br />That is the key part, its a quickie, only death interrupts you doing it and it can be done in combat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just an FYI for those wondering; you ARE create the mallet while protected by Divine Shield :D<br /><br />/dance Just finished it on my 46 pally with ~5 deaths total :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Coldbear</b></h3>Solo created at altar as 48 rogue, just wait for Hexx to walk away, sap the guard and click the mallet. Got attacked by a wolf but getting hit did not break the casting of the creating the mallet. Vanish, done. Booyah.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>eclipsespider</b></h3>ALL YOU NEED TO DO is solo 1 lvl 50 elite priest that has 2~ or so mobs as bodyguards. then use the mallet it drops at the top of the temple WHEN THE PRIESTESS PATS AWAY FROM THE SACRAFICING TABLE. THAT'S IT<br /><br />solod it on my 49 warlock</div>
