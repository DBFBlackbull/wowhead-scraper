It became quiet....<br /><br />I thought, I'm there... Oh.. Hold on.. What's that... Elite camp around Lake Mennar... I ran as far as I could and died because 3 elites (skull) just wouldn't stop bashing my brains in (dazing me) I died right next to the giant that 'guards' the road to Jubie and Blimo's cabin.<br /><br />Oh well.. The next part was easy... Walk down the swirly road.<br /><br />After buying one the second respawned after just 10 minutes, the thirth after 20 minutes.<br /><br />This will make my engineer very happy :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a 28 Tauren Shaman and I just made this run from Orgrimmar up the coast. I only died once and that might have been avoided. The only thing I saw were high level passive turtles until I got very close to the vendor. Then a large unknown level sea monster came cruising by. I stood on the bank and should have taken off up the coast. I stood and looked at him swim by...bad plan. As a wisp, I got to try to find the path out of the water. Find the barrel in the water (if you are swimming) and go to the left or right of it. There are a couple of shallow slopes up. The location coords are right on the money. I bought two Helmet plans and a Dragonscale armor plan from her husband (General Supplies). I just went upstairs and lay down (felt like Goldilocks in the bear's bed). I will wait for the respawn a few times and hearth back to Crossroads. It didn't take 10 minutes to make the run. Do it...but just not on my server please...lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you could do this as a level 1 anything!<br /><br />repair your armor, bring all yer money, and clear out your bags since these DO NOT STACK!<br /><br />i came in from south of ogremar. go east before you get to ogremar and head towards the coast. follow the shoreline north until you see the passive turtles, ugly crawfish, and the 3 headed dragon thingy. now, suck it up and die! be mindful to get as far north as you can before you meet yer maker though.<br /><br />when you appear as a ghost in the grave yard, take your ghostly self towards your corpse. find the hut at the base of the cliff and find slope near the barrel to get out of the water while your still dead. once you know where you'll be going, walk your ghostly self into ressurection range BUT DON'T RES YET! back up. you want to be as close as you can to the hut and as far away as possible from your corpse before you res. this should minimize the chance that the monsters will see you when you res. hell, if they do see you when you res, just run closer to the hut while you're still alive! when/if you die a second time, your corpse should be close enough to the hut so you can res on dry land away from the monsters. easy peasy no matter what your level. <br /><br />now LETS GO FARMIN'! yeah, it takes a while to farm this one. grab one, walk just outside the door, set to afk, and log out. set the countdown timer on your cell phone for 11 minuntes and log in again. be sure to talk to both vendors and get the &quot;1 of&quot; plans every time. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i'm a little lvl 16 tauren hoardie shaman.. i wanted to farm some $$$ and this goes for around 5g on our AH.<br /><br />I had ABSOLUTELY no problem getting here and getting the schematic.&nbsp; I didn't even see a mob, much less have one attack me.<br /><br />HOW:&nbsp; I flew to orgrimmar and ran north along the coastline until i had to swim.&nbsp; I then swam north until I hit Ashara.&nbsp; Once you get into Ashara, it won't be long until you see the little house on the hill where the helmet schematic lives...<br /><br />Here's the tricky part.&nbsp; Just remember it can be done!&nbsp; before you hit the barrel in the water there are some rocks you can jump up on.&nbsp; It will put you into a little V rock groove..&nbsp; I just hopped my way&nbsp; right up that V onto flat land.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hung around and got me 2 or 3 more helmets and hearthed back to the AH for my 20g payoff!&nbsp; No mobs, no fighting, no work.&nbsp; woot!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For all you people buying it out there for fun and profit...&nbsp; <br /><br />Bought one 7-5-06 2:28 AM<br />Bought one 7-5-06 2:38 AM<br /><br />Respawn time = 10 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hi there, im a lvl 35 warlock on the server Twisting Nether called TheDoggy.<br />i dont know but.. is there a chance to get there as alliance? i know theres 1 for horde but..<br />if so tell me :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay, I didn't have a problem traversing through Horde territory.&nbsp; There is no need to go through the valley of trials, just take the boat from Booty Bay to Ratchet and jump off the boat when you're close to Durotar coast.&nbsp; You'll be in the fatigue zone, but that won't last long once you start swimming towards Durotar.&nbsp; Reach the shore, mount up and travel towards Ogrimar, staying off the road (there are patrols).&nbsp; When you get near Razor hill you can go to the right of it (the humans at the Tiragarde Keep there are friendly to you)m go up the hill behind Razor Hill and take that route to avoid all horde until you get up to the North East corner, east of Skull Rock, you can walk on teh shore for a ways, then jump in the water and swim a ways.&nbsp; You'll eventually encounter&nbsp; a couple high level mobs, humanoids.&nbsp; You can go around them and get as close to the hut as possible (you'll see it).&nbsp; There is NO WAY up to the hut where the engineering plans are from the water.&nbsp; At the time of this writing the game is at patch 2.0, so this may have been fixed.&nbsp; It's simple, DIE... this isn't difficult at all, it's hard not to die if you get close to the shore near the hut, a murloc killed me (though it was a close battle).&nbsp; I am level 44 and his level was a skull to me, so I was proud to have reduced his health to 600 or so. ;)<br /><br />Anyhow, you'll rez north of that spot, just ghost run to the path that leads down to the hut and rez on top of the cliff, enter and buy your plans (30s for me at this time).&nbsp; Much cheaper than the 2G+ people were asking in the AH, so worth the trip.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just completed the trip and was able to jump out of the water up to the hut.&nbsp; The jump point is at the &quot;V&quot; just south of the barrel in the water.&nbsp; You have to keep jumping but eventually you can make it up to the hut where the schematic is sold.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The vender is located 45.90 in Azshara</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>does enyone know were tiragarde keep is</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I made this swim as a lvl 24 rogue without dieing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you can get this by swimming from durotar to azshara .<br />to get on the land you need to jump a bit from the southern part of the little &quot;island&quot;.<br /><br />you can get it at any lvl cause there are practically no mobs on your way there specially if you swimm parallel to the land.<br /><br />it needs 230 engineering.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>you are able to get to this hut by land or water (incase you wanna swim there)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>..around the coast where this is sold, a lot of high level mobs roam.<br /><br />For one:<br /><a href="/classic/npc=6349/great-wavethrasher">Great Wavethrasher</a> with some murloc oracle and some of those lobstermen things.<br /><br />So yeah, if you're getting here via water, you will probably die at least once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>45,91 of azshara</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>samuelvvv</b></h3>It IS possible to to get up on the shore by their hut without having to do a rez, at least if you have a mount or some kind of speed boost. After getting on my mount I was able to jump from one ledge to the other and then jump up. Died once getting there though, from the mobs in the water. Just rez as close as you can to the hut and keep swimming toward it.</div>
