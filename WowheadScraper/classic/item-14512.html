Mindsurge and Truefaith are very simular robes. They both offer Stam and mana reg. The 2 sec fade thing is pretty worthless to me. However I will say the +73 to heals is huge for a heal bonus on the other end mindsurge offers more mana reg. So here is my final take on Truefaith. I really don't think its worth the time or the money to make it in the long run. I have used both the robes listed above and a few others and I think mindsurge is a very underrated robe. This could be because for the most part I use a heavy mana reg build.

The longer the fight, the better manaregen is. This is very good for those. +healing helps save mana, it also get's better and better the longer the fight is.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks to my guildmates, Avowry, for helping me get this and the mats. The mats weren't so bad because we have a lot high levels. (Dam 10 mooncloth!) It's very cool looking, all white with black trim. There may be a couple better robes out there, but I like it much more than a Devout Robe, so I'm very happy.<br /><br />Yes you need to be a priest at lvl 60 with 300 tailoring. And like the robe of power, once you make it it's bound to you.<br /><br />Hemkara - Cenarius</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was in a 5-man Stratholme run lastnight on the Proudmoore Server, and the epic Truefaith Vestments Pattern dropped from Balnazzar.<br /><br />I am a lvl 60 holy priest with 300 tailoring so naturally, I rolled. The mage in the party misread that it was a priest only pattern and rolled also. The mage won the roll, but claims that he didn�t receive the pattern in his inventory, even though the log says &quot;Player received loot: Truefaith Vestments Pattern&quot;. He was very apologetic and swears that he didn�t receive the item.<br /><br />The corpse was still lootable for me, however nothing was showing up in the loot box - even after looting several times.<br /><br />It appears that the pattern isn't BoP even though the actual item it creates, is a class specific BoP epic item. Is there a known bug where it disappears for players who recieve the pattern who arent a priest?<br /><br />I logged a GM ticket as soon as it happened, but havent received a response as yet.</div>

I'll give Devout the slight edge in my opinion because it offers more stats overall. I left mooncloth robes out for a reason...<br /><br />So you say mana reg &gt; INT in long heals. I dont disagree with you, which is why I linked Mindsurge robes.<br />Mindsurge:<br />+12 Stam<br />+13 Int<br />10 Mana every 5 sec<br /><br />Ok so basically it comes down to this. Mindsurge and Truefaith are very simular robes. They both offer Stam and mana reg. The 2 sec fade thing is pretty worthless to me. However I will say the +73 to heals is huge for a heal bonus on the other end mindsurge offers more mana reg. So here is my final take on Truefaith. I really don't think its worth the time or the money to make it in the long run. I have used both the robes listed above and a few others and I think mindsurge is a very underrated robe. This could be because for the most part I use a heavy mana reg build. I also have nice INT gear but I tend to like the mana reg set better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The pattern and the robe isn't worth the effort. Get some higher rank playing BG and buy a nice chest for less than 10 gold.<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=38054">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=38054</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=40133">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=40133</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The lack of int means nothing here. The manaregen really takes care of that. As someone said, a 5 minute fight will give you the same mana as 20 int. Many boss figths take over 20 minutes, that's some 100int to get the same amount. The longer the fight, the better manaregen is. This is very good for those. +healing helps save mana, it also get's better and better the longer the fight is. Fade is golden in fights with many adds, like razorgore. Stamina is very important for a priest as you can't allways avoid damage. 200 hitpoints can be the difference between living or dying after a big hit, and it needless to say that a priest dying in a boss fight is not good!<br /><br />The int only helps in fast fights that the easy instances are full of like strat,scholo,ubrs etc. But If you can't manage without 20 int on robe, then you probably won't make it with that either :)<br /><br />More I'm conserned about lack of spirit, it's far more useful but hey, you can't get everything and the 2 reduction on fade cooldown is really unique, you can't get it from anything else. And it can save your life! Other stuff are full of int,sta,spi,manaregen,+healing etc. I'm going to make it for myself, even though I Have 4 pieces of prohepecy allready(not the robe)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>for those of you calling others noobs b/c they AH'd the pattern, and you're telling them the pattern is bop....YOU are the noob.&nbsp; the pattern is NOT soulbound when picked up.&nbsp; the robes ARE soulbound once they are made.&nbsp; read it again you noobs.&nbsp; so..NO, you do not have to be a priest and 300 tailor just to pick up the item, yes it would make more sense to give it to the 300 tailoring priest if they are in your group when it drops, but it is possible for others to pick up this pattern and sell it.&nbsp; who wouldn't want a few hundred gold?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I Dont think your missing anything, it dropped for me at lvl 57 with about 260 tailoring. I dont think you need anything special for it to drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its under a 2% drop rate. YOu haveing killed him 11 times and not seeing it drop is normal.&nbsp; I have killed the Golem Lord prob about 30 times and havent seen the second wind drop once for me even being a 20% drop rate.&nbsp; Its just bad luck man.&nbsp; Gl with it though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>haha someone sold pattern to me with 70G.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This pattern dropped and i won the greed roll for it.&nbsp; The priest in the party later /w me and said &quot;i'll give you 40g for that.&quot; i was thinking, &quot;LOL.&quot;&nbsp; After 10 minutes in the AH, it sold for 600g. used that to buy my epic Green mechanostrider mount ^.^ And if the priest wanted this he should have rolled need damn it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just bought the pattern in the AH today for a buyout of 136 gold. It had a bid for 106 gold but I didn't want to risk missing out getting this for less than 150 gold. I'm shocked someone said it sold for 400g and even 700 gold. There is always at least one of these patterns up for sale at around 150 gold. Time to start farming pearls!<br /><br />Uscbaritone<br />60 priest<br />Cenarius</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>About a week or so ago, this dropped and I won the roll for it.&nbsp; I've been holding on to it though.<br /><br />Our guild leader is a priest and one of our mages bought this off the AH for 300g to give to him.&nbsp; So technically it's the first tiem that it is dropped for our guild.&nbsp; I didn't want to sell it just encase we pick up another priest that is dedicated to the guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It just costs a bit much. I looted mine luckily, but I wasn't able to craft it for 3 weeks. You can easily do it if you run a lot of Live Strath though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This now goes for 10-30g on my server. A guldie even vendored his after he couldn't sell it for 2 months @ 25g. DO NOT PAY A LOT FOR THIS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The posted .56% drop rate on this is quite innacurate. The way this pattern works is, if you are a priest that is a tailor the pattern has somewhere around an <b>8% chance </b> to drop. For all you priests that desperatley would like this, dont worry, you just have do do Strath Living a lot and you will get it, the pattern is<i>not that rare</i>. If you are a priest, but not a tailor, the chances of this dropping are reduced quite a bit, probly reduced to 0%<br /><br />If the .56% drop rate was accurate, 3 priests in my guild wouldn't have them. Look at it this way, if you are a priest tailor, this epic pattern has the same drop chance as an uncommon regular drop<br /><br />Edited, Sun Jun 19 05:35:25 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>pattern doesnt bop, only the robe does when you make it. this one drops for any grp regardless of whether you have a priest in it at all, or whether he is tailor. drop rates arent affected by grp size/composition. this pattern can be rolled upon and looted by any class with any profession.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>PRIEST TAILORS should have a priority roll for this. PRIORITY. If any other class rolls when the priest is a tailor and still needs the pattern, then you deem yourself as an idiot. The pattern may not be BoP but the robes are only useful when a priest crafts them then priests have to buy the pattern because they keep losing the rolls?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Mine dropped off Balnazzar in Stratholme, which is what Grand Crusader *something* (the boss of scarlet side of Stratholme) turns into during the fight. The recipe is bind on pickup, the robe is priest only and the robe is bind on pickup, so dont roll if you arent a tailor priest :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can confirm that only a priest w/ 300 tailoring can even see this pattern when it drops, so no worries about non-priest, non-tailors looting it.</div>

Granted that <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16690">Devout Robes</a> only have a 6.84% drop rate, but thats more than 2x the rate on these and a lot more people (at least on my server) are running for their chest pieces out of UBRS...<br /><br />Edited, Tue Apr 18 00:55:45 2006</div>
