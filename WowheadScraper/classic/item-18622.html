<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The drop rate stated by thott may be wrong.<br /><br />Because I think only warlocks can get it and that drop rate is prob based on other classes killing them too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As far as I know, all the demons are underground. Entrance is 35.58 (or right above the &quot;N&quot; in jaedenar on the map. Not to many of them, and the essence have not dropped for me yet (after 8 kills or so)&nbsp; Its hard to solo at lvl 51 btw, so bring a few friends if you can.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have killed everything in that jaedenar camp and in both caves i have not seen any<br />im i at the right place?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Do the quest Rescue from Jaedenar while you're grinding for this essence.&nbsp; Starts here: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5202/a-strange-red-key">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5202/a-strange-red-key</a>.&nbsp; I can solo it at 55.&nbsp; The end of the quest spawns 3 Legions.&nbsp; Mine fell off one of them.&nbsp; Even though I failed the quest first try b/c the NPC chick elf died...<br /><br />Sheridan<br />Burning Legion</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I soloed this warlock quest at level 51.&nbsp; Here is some tips on how to do it.&nbsp; First, you have to find a Legionnarie, I found one in Shadow Hold next to the caged Night Elf.&nbsp; There was a level 54 warlock sitting next to him with an imp.&nbsp; Since the Legionnarie is a demon, I banished him and took out the warlock.&nbsp; Now after the warlock was gone, I banished the Legionnarie again again and rested.&nbsp; When he came back, it was easier to take him out without any other mobs around.&nbsp; As for the Dark portal and the Azshara ones Fel Essences, they patrol alone.&nbsp; Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you go during &quot;rush hour&quot; you will find groups in the cave at 35,58 doing other quests.&nbsp; I followed one in until I got to the Oozes then worked my way back to a large mob room, then back towards the Oozes until I got one.&nbsp; I'm a demonology build and used the blue guy to tank.&nbsp; I probably killed 10 legionaires before it finally dropped.&nbsp; It was tough but well timed soulstones and runecloth bandages got me through.&nbsp; Also, just ran out with a VW sacrafice and healthstone.&nbsp; Found a quiet place to die and just soulstoned back in.&nbsp; Found this one easier then the Dark Portal one (which I gave up on for the night)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>about 10 kills so far hasent dropes very badly desined quest&nbsp; soloing at lvl 51 demonology spec there not teribly hard but they kick you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The best way to get this I found was to do&nbsp; <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5954">this quest</a> at the same time. This chick will go to the bottom, and on the way out, legionares spawn all over. Instead of just 3 there will be 12+ to kill, good chance you will get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is always somebody that is lucky and get the drop on their first or second kill, and you always hear about their luck on these forums but the fact is in most cases it will take alot off time before u get the essence. There is only 6-7 Legionair in the whole <u><b>Shadow Hold</b></u> and u have to kill alot of trash mobs to get to them and have to wait on respawns. Sadown Hold is the cave to the far north in jadeanar not the first one.<br /><br />The quest is optained at lvl 50 but is impossible to solo at lvl 50. I suggest u get a freind lvl 60 to help u. Or wait until u are lvl 53-54 urself.<br /><br />A good advise it to take the Quest: Rescue from Jadeanar. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5203">ESSCORT QUEST</a> Becouse 6 Legionaire will spawn on the esscort. (3 at the time) and they can also drop the essence.<br /><br />Good Luck.<br /><br /></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>15 kills no drops</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got mine on the Second drop and im level 50. I had my 55 Pally friend with me so dont know if that might have helped or not.<br /><br />Mensha BE Lock&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Tortheldrin)<br />Volmire Troll Shammy&nbsp; (Magtheridon)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was depressed reading all this, couldnt even find a legionar* found one and killed him thx to a 53 pala ally (im horde) and got it! first drop woohooo!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>51 lock<br />first kill first drop<br />a 54 tauren warrior was doin the escort quest<br />so i helped him kill mobs and when the 55s attacked, killed them together with the warrior.<br />got the loot :) easy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went right through the cave to the very end where the elite is....there is bridge that has 2&nbsp; Jaedenar Legionnaires that are guarding the approach to the elite, if you don't get it off these 2 then move into the centre of the bridge and wait for respawns, rinse and repeat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this is really easy! farm there till u get the red key. then begin the escort q with th elf. u will face 6 legionaires on the way. kill them! then abandon and start again! constaant fleguard supply!<br /><br />BTW: to kill a grp of three, enslave one, banish another and kill the last. banish is off u kill. then dismiss the pet and kill!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got it off the guy shown above the second time i killed him....but the that might of been good luck idk</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Found that if u have a group an u start the escort quest in the cave, That there are alot more legionaires</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Terrible drop rate for me.<br /><br />Spent four hours killing these guys . . finally One Dropped- probably my zillionth kill. Even picked up the quest inside- which causes several Legionaires to spawn. No luck.<br /><br />Glad this one is over with.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>took about 20 kills maybe if that</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I solo'd this at lvl 54. I cleared the cave down to the room where the water and oozes are, then I kept moving back and forth through the length of the cave killing respawns. I finally picked up the essence off a legionnaire down in the room by the water on my third pass through. <br /><br />If you make good use of Banish and Enslave, clearing out this cave isn't tough. Just be aware of what is behind you because the Legionnaire will knock you back through the air a couple of times before he goes down. Once you aggro him, you might want to position yourself so a wall is behind you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I went at lvl 51, killed all down to the water and up again.. <br />but no essence.. Took some time but its doable, guess i need to take another<br />trip there. The other two essence's droped of first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped off the first mob I killed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've killed 2 dozen legos and still no drop....the other 2 gems I got right away. I will stay with it until it drops. I hope it doesn't take to long</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>detleth</b></h3>Just did this quest today. The Jaedenar one dropped on the first kill...</div>
