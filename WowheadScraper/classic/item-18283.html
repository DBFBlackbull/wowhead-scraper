<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the fact is that when u are gonna make / use this probably on a big epix ranged, this mean your guild is running some 40man istance, and u alredy have many items that give u chanche to hit so maybe u wont really need this if u have +4%-+5% from gear</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On Molten giants/destroys and firelords and all other trash in mc I have missed more then once and not just auto shots ive had a few missed aimed shots which it makes 3% chance to hit Majorly worth while cuz you never know if that aimed shot that missed was a 2k crit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On boss mobs, you have an 83% chance to hit. On level 60s, you have a 95% chance to hit. Yes, you need a whopping +16% chance to hit to max out on boss mobs. This scope is better for everyone using a ranged weapon, but is in no way worth it for a melee class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wow, surprised no1 has said this yet.<br /><br />your miss rate increases with the level of the mob, up to raid bosses (which are classed as level 63)<br /><br />to get a 100%hit rate you need 8.66%hit in total.&nbsp; any more than this is pointless and uneeded.&nbsp; This value is easier to round up to 9%.<br /><br />weapon skill gives 0.25%hit (and 0.2%crit) per point over 300 I think, if any1 is interested (not 100% sure on this though)<br /><br />now, as im sure alot of you are aware we shoot tranq shot on a few bosses, missing = bad news, so you should aim for 9% hit so that you are reliable as possible(tranq can still fail)<br /><br />this scope is better than a +7 scope if you are lack 2 or more +hit (i.e. if you have 7 or less)<br /><br />also, dont forget, slower weapons offer better dps, BUT +7scope on slower weapons offers a smaller dps increase.<br /><br />so you chooce, yes it is expensive but also very useful if used correctly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Above poster is incorrect.&nbsp; In order to test this, I leave a combat log up that only records misses.&nbsp; I don't have a screenshot of it, but with +7% to hit I ran all of AQ40 up to and including Huhuran, and all of BWL up to and including chromaggus.&nbsp; My combat log&nbsp; did not record a single miss.<br /><br />Also, 1 weapon skill = .04% to hit and +.04% to crit, per point above the target's defense skill.&nbsp; Therefore, the miss rate on a level 63 mob should be 5.6%.&nbsp; I haven't had much time to test this, mostly because my +hit gear is integral to my build and I dont feel like gimping myself in raids.<br /><br />Though without a saturated +hit rate, the +3% is better, but only if you're at +2% hit or below.&nbsp; Anything higher wastes the bonus, and most likely makes it inferior to the +7 damage scope.<br /><br />Also, I don't use the Accurascope, I use the +7.&nbsp; Why wouldnt they just give hunters a 1% crit scope?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For all the noobs here who think its useless, @ 1600 shots in MC my Hit rate was 94.8%, and that is with great gear. +3% chance to hit is great, not only on Magmadar but all hunter will think about our great Aimed shot miss rate in PVP aswel.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i dunno what happens in melee and honestly i dont care but stop being useless to ppl who come here to get some info.<br /><br />After 40 days played with 9-14%hit my RANGED attacks, ranged dmg spells and ranged debuffs havent missed not even ONCE in pvp and pve. <br /><br />---there is no such thing as 98% or 99%cap---<br /><br />Bosses need a minimum of +9%hit and even 1%miss is noticable on a 2hour run, a 2%hit is noticable almost on every single boss fight you'll engage at.<br /><br />HOWEVER: the scope isnt useless, especially on slow weapons like the smiting xbow where as you can see here --&gt; url=<a href="http://www.elxdraco.net/wow/huntercalc" rel="nofollow">http://www.elxdraco.net/wow/huntercalc</a> a +7dmg scope adds almost nothing. But when you are on a high end raiding guild, when you wear your fire res gear or nature res gear or in 1.11 your frost and possibly shadow res gear and you wont have your standard +hit tier 1or2 +hit items on, that 3%hit scope is FAR from useless.<br /><br />and stop reading guides, look around you and see whats really happening</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This would be good for a good gun for a class that doesn't use guns or bows as their main form of attack. Like, i'm a rogue, so I stuck this on my gun, which I crit for like 330, I often use my gun to try and kill them damn alliance that like to run away when their near death; +3% chance to hit would be a big deal as compared to +0% chance, its that +3% that I will kill someone instead of losing them to running.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This scope is FAR from useless.<br /><br />The 3% hit applies to melee as well as ranged weapons. With the lifting of the cap on +hit% to offhand weapons, rogues would LOVE this scope.<br /><br />Blizzard removed the spawn for this recipe, so ONLY expsting players can make it. I'd probably pay the 700-1000 gold for one, if I could find someone on Hyjal that would make it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A very useful tool for a few hunters.<br /><br />In AQ we use a meat shield approach for nature soaking, while tranqing.<br /><br />Using full NR gear we lose alot of +Hit and this gives us a nice option on a spare weapon for that hit regain. I use on my Fahrads Repeater.<br /><br />This +Hit is only for ranged. Which is a pity since there are no enchants for ranged weapons that can help melee users. Such a shame it was modified, but no use crying over spilt milk...<br /><br />The mats required for the making are stupid though, most guilds who will start needing it will be AQ/Naxx and wont be going MC on a regular schedule. Bit of a pain.<br /><br />although they are easily obtainable from some MC runs.<br /><br />Anyone looking at using this on their standard weapon, I strongly suggest you not waste materials on a venture. Hunters can easily get +9 hit from zg enchants, a few rings, and talents, not to mention the +hit already on our set pieces.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Sorry to break it to you. Hunter accuracy rate is around 98%<br /><br />+ 7 scope is better than this PoS</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This scope is pretty badass. People who think otherwise don't know what they're talkign about. Hunter missrate is about 95% or so, so this would help a decent amount. +15 bow or guns with gear would mean you'd have that same missrate vs a lvl 63. It'd be nice to lower that miss rate to 2% that way you're almost sure you wont miss tranq shot. Add voone's vice grips 2% to hit gloves and a tarnished elven ring, and you've got 101% if it is in fact 95%. You'll sacrifice a bit of dps, but it'll be way worth it in the end.<br /><br />This has to be the ultimate rogue scope by far though with their missrate. PCB or Satyr's Bow + 3% hit = &lt;3<br /><br />Edited, Tue May 10 03:20:49 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To DrizzTiaN: who said &quot;So you ppl that say you have over 99% hit chance are either lyers or just plain stupid...&quot;<br /><br />You have obviously never played a hunter to 60 with good gear. With talents and gear I have up to 17% to hit. Though I usually only wear about 8% (+3% from talents) = 11%<br /><br />Out of my last 31266 Autoshots, I've only missed twice. that's a 0.0% chance to miss. If you don't believe me. Here's the <a href="http://img316.imageshack.us/my.php?image=tohit3un.jpg" rel="nofollow">screenshot</a>.<br /><br />I also have this scope, but I'm waiting for Crossbow of Smiting from BWL to equip it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dasbaum</b></h3><b>In case you are wondering what the status of the attachment <a href="/classic/item=18283/biznicks-247x128-accurascope">Biznicks 247x128 Accurascope</a> is in classic wow:</b><br /><br />Some earlier posts from 2005 mentioned this to work for melee hit and the 50+ rated <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18283/biznicks-247x128-accurascope#comments:id=4612">post here</a> explain really well how it was changed to only affect ranged hit in Vanilla:<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">This item used to effect melee swings and was one of the most saught after enchantsments by rogues and warriors alike. It was nerfed to only ranged attacks and made to be a balanced part of the game.<br /><br />It was also taken out of the loot table for a long while until they fix it for ranged only. So, many engineers that had the pattern before they removed it from the loot table got to price gouge all they wanted as many servers only had a handful of people with it.</div><br /><br />WoW Classic is running the last Vanilla Patch 1.12. Meaning that we play on a version of wow. Where the scope has been already changed to work only with ranged attacks.<br /><br />This is also underlined by the item tooltip: &quot;Use: Attaches a permanent scope to a <b>bow or gun</b> that increases <b>its</b> chance to hit by 3%.&quot;<br /><br />The grammatical structure is mentioning that only the bow or gun is affected.<br /><br />The <a href="/classic/item=18290/schematic-biznicks-247x128-accurascope">Schematic: Biznicks 247x128 Accurascope</a> started dropping with the Dire Maul Content Patch mirroring the &quot;fix&quot; time in Vanilla.<br /><br /><b>If</b> this were to work for Melee it would be super cheap, better even than <a href="/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman">Drake Fang Talisman</a> and absolute must for any Melee. Since it's <b>not working</b> for Melee you won't find it on any Melee BIS List.</div>
