<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Two dropped last night on a guild LBRS run. Irony was we had to pick up extras cause not much the guild was one. Other warlock got one i was unhappy to say the least, then the next kill another one dropped. Randomly i am noticing crazy stuff like this. 30 minutes after that happended two devout belts drops the same way further down the instance right before the spiders.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>bunch of crap.. was worth 25 S at vendor.. did the quest in felwood so it was totally useless. Easier way to get it too, run from here to there.. own some elite, done</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you don't want to grind madly 4 it just do the quest. But have a party with you to help you kill Kroshius cuz he is elite.<br />But 6% chance is not so low... you should get one fast even grinding.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone have a strategy that could make farming this thing a bit easier? Its hard enough to find a LBRS raid, and having to spend 2 hours in the instance just to farm the first 10 minutes sucks (and no I cant just quit the raid after all the warlocks are killed, I would be hated by the entire realm)</div>
