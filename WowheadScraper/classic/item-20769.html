It's cute and attracts a lot of attention. Plus the greenish aura makes lots of people stop to cure me from poison or disease. There's one disadvantage people should know about though: this pet is very noisy. The constant, bubbling sound is cool at first but becomes a real pain later. In raids or in cities, be prepared for complaints from people standing nearby.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4289</b></h3>Disgusting Oozeling is one of the most rare and special pets in game.<br />The only pet that have a buff effectthat turns the user green when you bring up the pet it also emitts a slimy sound around you.<br /><br />Oozeling all over the world at higher levls have 10% chanse to drop a oozeling bag with random items in. There is a 1% chanse that this pet appears in that bag, this makes the pet have a 0.1% drop chanse from oozeling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8661</b></h3>I love this little guy. :) He's my precious oozy and I loves him.<br /><br />Go to BRD and get the Ale, and then throw it at oozy and see what happens :) He emotes!!! &quot;Disgusting Oozeling guzzles the ale&quot; and then he burps! Oh he's so funny. <br /><br />However, I can't take him on a guild run because of the debuff. Originally the debuff stayed on you the entire time, but now it fades off and on the whole time you have him out. Also, if you accidentlly throw the ale where he can't get to it, like on a ledge... he will sit there and spam his emote until the mug disappears. He won't even follow you any more, just sits there and spams chat for a good 3 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hi peeps.<br /><br />I got my oozeling by killing a RARE ooze which lies under the swamp in Felwood. Its called Blood Venom Falls. I think once every 24 hours there is a rare spawn. It is a grey ooze you should be looking for and not the greens which are harder to drop I think. My first kill on the rare spawn and I got it. <br /><br />Try and good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Going on 6 days of farming.&nbsp; About 4-18 hours per day.&nbsp; I've killed hundreds upon hundreds of those damned slimes.&nbsp; I've gotton an epic, 5 rare drops, countless greens, and even a double bag drop.&nbsp; No oozeling...<br /><br />I've gained level 55, 56, 57, 58, and working on 59 ALL ON OOZE EXPERIENCE.&nbsp; Its maddening.&nbsp; I'll dump my weekend into getting it...&nbsp; Maybe I can snag 60 on them.&nbsp; Only need 1020 or so to get to level 59, and I'm over halfway there now.&nbsp; :\</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got mine today (7 april 2006) :)<br /><br />Been farming for maybe 3 days, getting my dark whelpling was harder imho.<br /><br />Tips if you don't wanna be bored is to have a good guild with a funny guild chat, makes time fly away, this is what made me forget how boring it was when I was hunting for my dark whelpling :).<br /><br />Another tip is to read a web comic from the beginning to the end while you'grinding. I read pvponline.com while hunting for my oozeling, but you can also check out machall, gucomics, penny-arcade and ctrl-alt-delete. This only works for meele classes like druid, shaman, hunter, warrior and rogue. Maybe warlock can do it to with a little wanding.<br /><br />Podcasts is also nice :) Listening to &quot;The Dawn and Drew show&quot; while grinding Timbermaw rep :)<br /><br />Just shift your attention to something else other than the thing you're killing and it feels that it goes much faster :).<br /><br />Vote for me, cause these tips must be spread to the people :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got mine off an Ooze in Un'goro Crater. I'd never heard of it before I got it. I'd killed only about 50 or so Oozes, so I guess its really down to luck if you get one or not.<br /><br />Now how much to sell it for ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I started off with 30 or so free spaces in my bag when I began grinding for my oozling. When I filled my bags I decided to call it quits and went to the vendor to dispose of my trash items. Between coin loot and vendor trash, I made 25g. All in less than two hours. I'm a rogue though so I didn't have any downtime really.<br /><br />The Tainted Oozes tend to drop a lot of Bulky Mauls, Tapered Greatswords, etc. The items that sell to vendors for almost 2g.<br /><br />Just figured I'd let you guys know. It's an easy way to make money and you just might get a Disgusting Oozeling as well.<br /><br />edit: I forgot to mention that I also had a Basilisk Bone drop which I vendored as well since I couldn't DE it and it's a crappy blue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Drops where</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just a side note, since everyone here said they got one within hours or just a couple days of farming, and since it is fact, this little critter has a much better drop rate than the whelplings. You can farm for weeks or months and not get a whelpling since the highest drop rate they have is 0.09 (Don't ask me how I know, it nearly makes me cry after a month of farming. -&gt;My whelpling was an AH drop for 105g&lt;-). The drop rate for these little boogers is 1.87, making this a much better drop rate. I'm suprised we haven't seen more of them, and with such a good drop rate, we should be seeing the price of them go down as more people find out about them and start farming......</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was farming for one of these for about a week straight and gave up. I've been checking the AH ever since, seeing it up there once or twice for &gt;300g, which I wasn't about to pay. Saw one up last night for 75g and got it. (Mal'ganis horde)</div>

The pic of the oozeling here shows him black. Instead the one on WoWWiki shows him green.

If that doesn't sell, I'll make the cute little guy into the guild mascot.<br /><br />These things are really rare. I'm surprised that other people aren't trying to gouge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Best Pet Evar!<br /><br />Thank goodness I am a hunter. How many classes can farm something 5 lvls higher than themselves? Saw one that an Undead Warrior had. Asked him where did he get it. He told me, &quot;If I told you, I would have to kill you&quot; =( What a meanie. Hope to get mine soon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>2.5 hours killing (Felwood) &quot;tainted Oozes&quot; ( Loc. 41,47 ). Got my Oozelin inside 8th bag.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Feb 15 12:07:40 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farmed Tainted Ooze´s in Felwood for like 5hours, 100ish bags, no oozeling. A friend of mine farmed the recipe for Greater Nature protection potion meanwhile in WPL, he found one so i bought his for 130g.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, Sagecat, you may have gotten your wish - sort of. I have 3 toons with the ooze pet and it's officially broken with patch v1.12. For some reason the debuff turns off and on in semi-regular intervals - like 5 seconds on 5 seconds off. The trouble is that your toon goes from green to normal to green to normal... You get the idea. My guess is that blizz was trying to pulse the ooze disgusting aura so that it would take effect when you mount or shapeshift. Pre-v1.12 the green effect would disappear for good the first time you did either. Well, until you dismissed and resummoned your pet again. Regardless, it's a wee bit irritating right now. :( <br /><br />Gm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ronnburgundy</b></h3>Confirmed for classic wow : The oozeling no longer provides any visual &quot;aura&quot; on the user. The debuff &quot;aura&quot; is still however a thing, obviously. Very disappointed =/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vDeej</b></h3>If anyone is wondering how to mute the pet sounds in classic you need to make these folders:<br /><br />&quot;World of Warcraft\_classic_\sound\ambience\water&quot;<br /><br />then a file inside the water folder called &quot;greenslimeloop1.ogg&quot; you can make this file as a notepad then save as a .ogg file. Enjoy the silence</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kurji</b></h3>The -20 Defense component of <a href="/classic/spell=25163/oozelings-disgusting-aura">Oozeling's Disgusting Aura</a> emitted by this oozeling does have some niche uses. For example when you're stacking on effects that trigger damage to your target whenever you are struck in combat, it's beneficial to have less defense, because then you will be struck more in combat. The rare, but very interesting item <a href="/classic/item=12588/bonespike-shoulder">Bonespike Shoulder</a> will also proc more when used together with the oozeling, as having a lower Defense value means you'll be crit more in combat.<br /><br /><b><a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-set/damage-when-hit-warrior-169624">Here's</a></b> an example gear set that would benefit greatly from using a Disgusting Oozeling.<br /><br />A lowered Defense value can also be of minor benefit for Paladins with <a href="/classic/spell=20182/reckoning">Reckoning</a>, Shamans with <a href="/classic/spell=29065/eye-of-the-storm">Eye of the Storm</a>, Priests with <a href="/classic/spell=14774/martyrdom">Martyrdom</a> and/or <a href="/classic/spell=27816/blessed-recovery">Blessed Recovery</a> and Warriors with <a href="/classic/spell=16492/blood-craze">Blood Craze</a> in specific situations.

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
