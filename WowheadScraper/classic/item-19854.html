It's bonuses are good for a hunter but will be better used by an arms spec warrior. However I am usually allowed to bid\/roll on items like this for the following obvious reason.\n\nMy guild is a pvp guild that runs ZG and AQ20 for weapons & armour. I acknowledge that if a hunter is meleeing in a pve raid there is a serious problem (lava surger fights in MC are an obvious exception) and we are well aware - as some of you feel the need to remind us - that we are a range orientated class. However, everyone and their dog knows this, so what do they do in pvp against a hunter? You guessed it, do everything in their power to engage him\/her in melee or in case of casters get inside his\/her range.\n\nAlmost every hunter in our guild uses the 5\/5 LR + scatter shot build (21\/30\/0 build) as it maximises your survivability in melee which is usually where you will take the biggest beating. Kiting is all well and good, but eventually a good opponent is going to get inside your range (I spend about 30% of my combat time in BGs meleeing and I'm warlord rank so I've been doing it for a while). You have scatter, feign\/freeze trap & deterrance\/counterattack to get out again (which is almost always the right decision). But when they are on cooldown or fail you will be locked in melee and without a decent melee weapon you will be killed.\n\nBefore I go any farther I'd like to say that I now use this weapon and was the 4th person in my guild to recieve it (passed twice, asked and was denied third time, asked and was given 4th). My RS crits are at 44% and crit 1400+ on cloth, 1100+ on leather and 700+ on plate (varies on opponents gear obviously). My aimed shot crits go for 2000+, 1500+ and 1000+ respectively. Anyone that can take a 1000+ raptor strike and tell you a hunter is useless in melee has a shaky grip on reality.\n\nIn duels I easily out-melee shamans, and with deterence and AoM a rogue finds it very hard to land a strike, while taking a decent amount of punishment. Warriors will beat you 1 on 1 but in pvp you will have wounded him before he finally gets you locked in melee and then your melee weapon decides whether you live or you die. \n\nThe cloth crits speak for themselves, the wounded mage that blinks into you to do the standard nova, sheep, AP, fireball + PoM Pyro + Fireblast combo will not kill you if the raptor strike he walks into takes off 1400+. The crits are even big enough to entirely remove a priests PWS in a single attack. Go on and tell me thats not valuable?\n\nNo, a hunter is not a melee damage specialist. No, a hunter should not be meleeing in raid pve (unless the fight actually requires no ranged damage). And in my personal opinion, a 2h weapon which a warrior and a hunter both desire should usually go to the warrior...\n\n- (although if you use the same argument that some warriors in pve use against hunters, warriors should always be either tanking with 1h and shield, or dpsing as a plate rogue with 2 awesome 1 handers, so what do you need the weapon for? PVP and solo pve I hear you cry? Same thing as us then. The whole \"it doesnt help the raid as much by giving this to a hunter instead of me\" argument doesnt work unless you are a designated dps arms warrior in the raid, which if you are then by all means take it, you are the #1 priority for such a weapon and should get slow 2h high end damage weapons such as this) -\n\ncont... BUT, anyone that says a hunter does not need such a weapon does not have a hunter himself\/herself. No hunter I know only does raid instances, and outside of them a good melee weapon is not only beneficial, it is frequently the factor deciding whether you are collecting the allies fallen head, or he is taking yours.\n\nPoint being: Stop saying hunters dont need melee weapons. Everyone that can wield it needs a weapon like this in pvp and solo pve, warriors hunters paladins and enhancement shamans (obviously not this particular weapon in the case of the latter but you know what I mean).

I've got a all three that can use this weapon warrior\/pally\/hunter.  A paladin would have to burn way to much mana to make the DPS actually noticeable.  For PvP yes this would be a decent weapon, but I think as far as raid priorities a paladin shouldn't be able to roll\/bid on this period unless all hunters and warriors passed.\n\nSecond I wouldn't get this on my warrior unless I only wanted it for PvP.  A DPS warrior thats actually good with this weapon using it to the full capability that it has would rip aggro off a tank in a matter of seconds, being that he has no aggro dropping moves, thus ending up tanking with a two hander which requires way more healing which can also cause aggro problems.  \n\nThird i've always been #1 on the DPS meter on my hunter, sometimes #2 just behind one of our good rogues.  Rogues can fient which reduces aggro, and also vanish which puts them back at 0 aggro.  A good hunter can blast out 5000 Dmg after 3 sunders and Feign death putting him at 0 aggro.  I aquired this weapon recently on my hunter and no one in my guild questioned me period.  +25 agility on it puts me at a +122 AP which is huge! not to mention the +308 hp.  So it all depends on your hunters really.  sh*tty hunters will never be able to fully use the capability of this weapon(which is about 90% of the hunters out there).  There are plenty of fights that require melee DPS as a hunter and this weapon if used correctly is great for it.  A good hunter can raptor strike a Surger(MC)or a Berserker(ZG) when they do the random charge near them and go back to the tank, then continue range dps.  But some hunters just suck and won't ever be that quick.   A paladin....well I hope you pvp alot and I feel sorry for your teammates that need heals while you are DPS'ing LoL.  \n\nThe epic hunter staff is also terrible unless your in Winterspring soloing demons in Darkwhisper.  Something which almost 95% hunters probably will never be able to do.  Or for tanking Ayamiss in aq20 and a few encounters in aq40.  As far as warriors or rogues rolling on MC\/ZG\/AQ bows that is how it should be.  A hunter in MC that rolls on a ZG or MC bow is stupid and just waisted dkp or an upgrade for a warrior\/rogue.  The epic bow is by far better than anything you might find until the latter fights in BWL, AQ40, and Naxx.  \n\n[i][small]Edited, Aug 22nd  2006 at  3:42am EDT by Zarkullen[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-08-22T07:18:26-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Anyone else who reads this, pay attention.

Now if you factor in enchants (+25 Agility on Destroyer) and (+15 on each sword) The Hakkari war blades end up with more attack power, more crit. This is for those ranged eat people alive hunters, where as Destroyer is for hunters who like lots of life and high raptor strikes :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>46466</b></h3>For all those people saying it's a hunter weapon, last time i checked it was a melee weapon, and I don't believe a hunter's Prime source of damage is melee. Now, with that said, If a Warrior doesn't want it, then by all means a hunter should take it, a great weapon but definetly more of a Warrior weapon for the simple fact that Warriors don't go taking Bows and stuff over hunters, so Hunters shouldnt take Melee weapons from warriors, but then again, none of this matters anymore since it is now rather worthless</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, all I ever see on a 2 handed thread post is how a hunter got this and had no right to even roll/bid/exist.<br /><br />First off I'd like to say I would not bid on this without speaking to the warrior class officer (horde side so need to ask about pallies) for permission to bid/roll. It's bonuses are good for a hunter but will be better used by an arms spec warrior. However I am usually allowed to bid/roll on items like this for the following obvious reason.<br /><br />My guild is a pvp guild that runs ZG and AQ20 for weapons &amp; armour. I acknowledge that if a hunter is meleeing in a pve raid there is a serious problem (lava surger fights in MC are an obvious exception) and we are well aware - as some of you feel the need to remind us - that we are a range orientated class. However, everyone and their dog knows this, so what do they do in pvp against a hunter? You guessed it, do everything in their power to engage him/her in melee or in case of casters get inside his/her range.<br /><br />Almost every hunter in our guild uses the 5/5 LR + scatter shot build (21/30/0 build) as it maximises your survivability in melee which is usually where you will take the biggest beating. Kiting is all well and good, but eventually a good opponent is going to get inside your range (I spend about 30% of my combat time in BGs meleeing and I'm warlord rank so I've been doing it for a while). You have scatter, feign/freeze trap &amp; deterrance/counterattack to get out again (which is almost always the right decision). But when they are on cooldown or fail you will be locked in melee and without a decent melee weapon you will be killed.<br /><br />Before I go any farther I'd like to say that I now use this weapon and was the 4th person in my guild to recieve it (passed twice, asked and was denied third time, asked and was given 4th). My RS crits are at 44% and crit 1400+ on cloth, 1100+ on leather and 700+ on plate (varies on opponents gear obviously). My aimed shot crits go for 2000+, 1500+ and 1000+ respectively. Anyone that can take a 1000+ raptor strike and tell you a hunter is useless in melee has a shaky grip on reality.<br /><br />In duels I easily out-melee shamans, and with deterence and AoM a rogue finds it very hard to land a strike, while taking a decent amount of punishment. Warriors will beat you 1 on 1 but in pvp you will have wounded him before he finally gets you locked in melee and then your melee weapon decides whether you live or you die. <br /><br />The cloth crits speak for themselves, the wounded mage that blinks into you to do the standard nova, sheep, AP, fireball + PoM Pyro + Fireblast combo will not kill you if the raptor strike he walks into takes off 1400+. The crits are even big enough to entirely remove a priests PWS in a single attack. Go on and tell me thats not valuable?<br /><br />No, a hunter is not a melee damage specialist. No, a hunter should not be meleeing in raid pve (unless the fight actually requires no ranged damage). And in my personal opinion, a 2h weapon which a warrior and a hunter both desire should usually go to the warrior...<br /><br />- (although if you use the same argument that some warriors in pve use against hunters, warriors should always be either tanking with 1h and shield, or dpsing as a plate rogue with 2 awesome 1 handers, so what do you need the weapon for? PVP and solo pve I hear you cry? Same thing as us then. The whole &quot;it doesnt help the raid as much by giving this to a hunter instead of me&quot; argument doesnt work unless you are a designated dps arms warrior in the raid, which if you are then by all means take it, you are the #1 priority for such a weapon and should get slow 2h high end damage weapons such as this) -<br /><br />cont... BUT, anyone that says a hunter does not need such a weapon does not have a hunter himself/herself. No hunter I know only does raid instances, and outside of them a good melee weapon is not only beneficial, it is frequently the factor deciding whether you are collecting the allies fallen head, or he is taking yours.<br /><br />Point being: Stop saying hunters dont need melee weapons. Everyone that can wield it needs a weapon like this in pvp and solo pve, warriors hunters paladins and enhancement shamans (obviously not this particular weapon in the case of the latter but you know what I mean). We all get the same amount of dkp from a boss, and we all take the same time to kill it. Any hunter that chooses to use his dkp on this should be understood exactly the same way any rogue or warrior bids on a ranged weapon and not get the passionate class bashing which makes me ashamed to admit I also have a 60 warrior. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did and lastly the words which appear in our Guild Message of The Day constantly.<br /><br />&quot;Remember its a game lads, and we'll all get on fine.&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>SoC is based entirely on weapon damage range, and thus the only way a pally can get decent damage is a slow hard hitting 2 handed weapon like this one, it's also why nobody uses the arcantite champion, even though it is a great sword for warriors now that they put in the normalized attack power.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This COULD be used by Hunters. BUT Hunters are a ranged class. This might be useful if you are switching out weapons for melee, but you should be trying to get away, not killing someone. You just aren't effective at close range, Survival specced or no. BSL + two 15+ agi = 56 agi, 112 RAP.<br /><br />Even with ZdoW 15+ agi, that is only 102 RAP, and RAP does not figure into dodge, crit, or parry calculations. ZdoW is what you want if you go into melee to kill, which is not a good place for any Hunter to be... unless you are hoping they will take a look at this enourmous sword and just run like hell. BSL combo with agi enchantment would be what you want to equip when you are forced into melee and want to escape back to range.<br /><br />edit: You may consider the added STA as an offset to decreased dodge parry calculations.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Nov 8 11:18:03 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have one but just got me a Drake Talon cleaver. I choose to use that over it even though auto attack hits dont seem to be quite as hard. I would recommend this sword to all warriors firstly. It is a great mortal strike weapon and can take you to the end of MC/into BWL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok first off guys paladins don't deserve this weapon unless it has been passed to them. I've got a all three that can use this weapon warrior/pally/hunter. A paladin would have to burn way to much mana to make the DPS actually noticeable. For PvP yes this would be a decent weapon, but I think as far as raid priorities a paladin shouldn't be able to roll/bid on this period unless all hunters and warriors passed.<br /><br />Second I wouldn't get this on my warrior unless I only wanted it for PvP. A DPS warrior thats actually good with this weapon using it to the full capability that it has would rip aggro off a tank in a matter of seconds, being that he has no aggro dropping moves, thus ending up tanking with a two hander which requires way more healing which can also cause aggro problems. <br /><br />Third i've always been #1 on the DPS meter on my hunter, sometimes #2 just behind one of our good rogues. Rogues can fient which reduces aggro, and also vanish which puts them back at 0 aggro. A good hunter can blast out 5000 Dmg after 3 sunders and Feign death putting him at 0 aggro. I aquired this weapon recently on my hunter and no one in my guild questioned me period. +25 agility on it puts me at a +122 AP which is huge! not to mention the +308 hp. So it all depends on your hunters really. sh*tty hunters will never be able to fully use the capability of this weapon(which is about 90% of the hunters out there). There are plenty of fights that require melee DPS as a hunter and this weapon if used correctly is great for it. A good hunter can raptor strike a Surger(MC)or a Berserker(ZG) when they do the random charge near them and go back to the tank, then continue range dps. But some hunters just suck and won't ever be that quick. A paladin....well I hope you pvp alot and I feel sorry for your teammates that need heals while you are DPS'ing LoL. <br /><br />The epic hunter staff is also terrible unless your in Winterspring soloing demons in Darkwhisper. Something which almost 95% hunters probably will never be able to do. Or for tanking Ayamiss in aq20 and a few encounters in aq40. As far as warriors or rogues rolling on MC/ZG/AQ bows that is how it should be. A hunter in MC that rolls on a ZG or MC bow is stupid and just waisted dkp or an upgrade for a warrior/rogue. The epic bow is by far better than anything you might find until the latter fights in BWL, AQ40, and Naxx. <br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 22nd 2006 at 3:42am EDT by Zarkullen</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunters here so funny so i had to sign up here to comment it its defently more a pally or warrior weapon. Hunters go play with ur bow :)<br /><br />And its a bit more pally in my opinion. As its a 2h<br /><br />Prob wont get a good anwser but i try again.<br /><br />So how dose a Pally weapon look like ? I mean its not STR/STA and not when its AGI or Defence. So whats your opinion. <br /><br />I see alot of this in our guild as soon something have int its a caster but not pally (same if it have increas healing done by XX) Defence and Stamina its Warrior. Even tho i as a pally tank the core hounds just as good as a warrior :). Agi its hunter or Rogue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Not to popular with Warriors for long. Much better can be achieved in 40 man instances, and if you are running ZG you most likely will be reaching far in 40 man zones.<br /><br />This is usually between a Hunter and a Paladin. A Hunter would take for stats, but may not because using the two hakkari blades with enchants in slightly better.<br /><br />Paladins can get a lot of 2h after warriors or before or at the same time. A smart hunter would get one with decent stats, such as this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>OK about this sword.....<br /><br />Its not as useful for Hunters as it is for Pallys or Warriors. Hunters mainly use their range for DPS, not melee, even if they can do it sucessfully. Paladins and Warriors require melee to do any sort of damage and in that sense, this sword is more attuned for them with Warriors have priority over all other classes. This weapon is great for Retrobution Paladins because they gain so much more of a bonus that any type of Hunter would.<br /><br />Hunters do need the attack power but most of them DE this weapon after they get their epic staff from quest line. Hunters using this are probably in a guild that uses DKP and probably outbidded a warrior to get it. Most guilds who use rolling to win items in ZG dont allow Hunters to roll on it for the fact that they get better off of 1hd axes, or 2hd axes such as Dawn's Edge and other such weapons that give agility as the main stat.<br /><br />I really dont care if Hunters have it but Hunters dont deserve to roll against the melee classes or Warriors and Pallys because they need it a lot more that hunters do.<br /><br />Have fun raiding in ZG =D</div>

So hunters before you yell at your raid 72ap omfghunterlewtftw ore some gibbersish like that spare a thaught for the warriors who your depriving of perhaps the most beautiful melee weapon in the game and one that was clearly made just for them.<br /><br />and incidentally im a warrior im prot most of the time but i go arms at weekends to take in the pvp and my god this sword is fun if your an arms warrior .. critting for about 1000 damadge with my whirlwinds ;) and more with my ms's.</div>

(weapon shoulder gloves belt boots legs)<br /><br />btw protection pallies are dumbasses unless they belong to a PVP guild and prolly every PVP guild do raids.<br /><br />but a holy/ret pala with a shield is not a noob after spending 40 gold the best talent builds for PVP and PVE is 33/05/11<br /><br />now to move on to why palas dont last long in pvp to kill most enemies<br /><br />firstly they have to learn combos<br /><br />here is the pwnage combo<br /><br />SO crusader --&gt; judge imediately --&gt; SO Command + a 2 hander --&gt; holy shock --&gt; hammer justice --&gt; judge again --&gt; rebuff SO command and repeat.<br /><br />rule one: when fightin against a caster or shaman its best to use up half your mana to cause dps then save the rest. heal when nessessary and use bubble if in emergency. when they are out of mana u have the advantage of plate armor defense. now wipe them out.<br /><br />rule two: dont solo a lock most will kill you in a large number of ways from DOTs to DOTs fear to DOTS charmed to DOTs and DOTs etcetc.<br /><br />rule three this applies to hunters mages and wars. these guys slow palas down. a pala has no ranged attack so if the movement sped is slowed the other classes can pick him off. have blessin of freedom in your bar at all times it could save your ass especially from those 3 classes. <br /><br />rule four: many rogues boast they can kill palas easily. this is only because most palas dont know how to fight rogues. a rogue typically ambushes u stuns and rips u to shreads. but a rogue your level cannot kill u very fast it will take at least 10 seconds. the minute u lose 1/4 hp start healin holy light. he will prolly stun. then once out of stun start healin again he will stun again with a different ability. at this stage a rogue will do two things. he may run like a chicken if he knows whats gonna happen to him next. o he will fight which will be his end. at this stage a rogue will have some abilities on cooldown. so he will do moderate damage over time rather than the full rip and kill multi combos. now u have 2/3 mana left plently to kill a rogue. enjoy your kill and use blessin of freedom. if your a human paladin your kill may get wise and atempt to run. the miunte u notice hes tryin to get away and he has 1/3 of his hp left then stun him. if this aint possible use your racial perception ability and take him out when he stealths. if your a dwarf then hope he doesnt get wise and try to run. <br /><br />a rogue does better in pvp when gangin people if ure the target of a rogue its likely another enemy is watchin the stealthed rogue waitin to attack whatever target the rogue attacks so when this happens and u have more than one enemy near you its best to use divine shield. but remember it's cooldown. <br /><br />sorry about the spellin mistakes try to guess the words.<br /><br />written by Hyperion Hakkar Europe Paladin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have a tank spec'd Pally and find that I always do more damage than the Warriors.<br /><br />Warriors should use one-hander + shield because they can handle the damage for longer and can hold threat essentially giving all the other players time to deliver group damage. Meanwhile the Pally is /assisting the warrior with the big two hander and can dish out some serious damage. <br /><br />Im pretty sure that this combination will acheive more damage and a better result. Why have the pally with a 1 hander + shield because a good warrior will hold threat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First of all, I don't see any text on this weapon that says 'Class: Warrior'<br /><br />I am a paladin myself and paladins are backup healers in raids. ofcourse.<br />Though when it comes to this weapon it could go either Paladin, Warrior or Hunter and it wouldn't even make much difference! Like paladins are healers in raids, warriors are tanks in raids. A warrior that uses a 2h in a raid is like a paladin that goes DPS in a raid.<br /><br />If you want DPS, go get another rogue or mage or lock inside, don't get a 2h warrior! And all warriors should always use a 1h + shield because there are always trashmobs to tank or adds to tank. At bosses you always need to make sure aggro is being hold or you have to back the MT up if he loses aggro!<br /><br />so this 2h weapon is just as useless to a warrior as to a paladin in a raid.<br />It is a very good weapon in pvp though, but since pvp is a whole other story, I think this weapon should go to ANY paladin, warrior or hunter no matter who needs it most, they got equal rights and should go on dkp</div>

Every one fighting over this sword plays the game a little to much and need to take a break go for a walk in the park or something. The reason Im going to try to get it for my pally is because I use seal of the crusader the +40% attack speed at the cost of some damage helps out alot. Every wep I used that with my dps went up by at least 9 but I plan to get the sword and use it alot. Im one of the pallys that will jump right into the fight and dont complain about it I was going to do a tanking warrior but I wanted the extra protection and some healing to keep myself alive. but great wep for anyone who can use it. Oh theres one thing I gotta say .....why does every single person use the same exact equipment/build I wanna see people mixed up a little more do random things.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Id definately say this weapon is equal for both Warriors and Hunters. It has a pretty awesome look too =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this sword is probally the niceset sword i have ever seen as the first person says look at the fuking thing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>All that say it isnt good for a hunter, here are the facts: lots of war only weapons that give str that are easier to get from mc/aq20. Too much competition involved in getting core hound tooth, warblades and fang etc. Last of all if a pally is meleeing and AP is so vital then he should just reroll warrior or stick to dispelling. <br /><br />Im a 0/21/30 hunter and this pops out 129.5 AP with LR and +25 agi. If your guild lets you have it then go for it. Luckly for me we had all prot wars and pallies werent allowed it so i got it first time i killed hakkar( think first or second time it ever dropped for guild)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Oct 22nd 2006 at 12:24am PDT by teladaa</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Grats on that, shame to see it on a Paladin as it's clearly a Hunter weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Someone even did an extensive test to prove it. Swords with the same stats as axes did more damage over time and more burst damage taking everything (weapon stats, deep wounds) into consideration.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>True, there are much better weapons for W/Pala out there for guilds completing MC. Many also wait for their spinal.<br /><br />While it is true that hunters (try to) rarely use melee; we use them for our ranged stats. And they're definitely nice. I'll just pray the bubbleboys and W pass on it, wouldn't roll against them though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I Hate to argue, but seeing as most people are quite retarded on these forums. this is a 2H weapon. So any class that can use a 2H weapon is eligible for the weapon. no class gets this in preference. Warriors can use it, Pallies can use it and Hunters can use. So keep you mouthes shut and stop with the stupid arguments.<br /><br />M</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hakkar dropped it two nights ago for my guild. If your guild is worth anything there won't be any arguing over who gets it. One of the hunters in my guild ended up getting it, and we were all pretty damn happy for him. Let's face it, this game, especially end game instances, is about teamwork and camaraderie.. there shouldn't be any fight over who gets it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ofc this is an awesome MS warrior weapon. But as in my guild all warriors already have something better (rank 14 sword or untamed blades) I got this for my hunter. Great for pvp ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>hehe, sorry, always wanted to say that:p<br /><br />Im going for this sword because its awesome in stat and it LOOKS awesome. <br /><br />Yes I run 40 man instances, I have full might now.<br /><br />Yes I know there are swords with better stats..<br />I just love these looks.<br /><br />Seriously, how can anything compete to a sword thats called &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;? <br /><br />Whats that you got there?<br />Oh this? nothing its just the DESTROYER OF WORLDS.<br /><br />bwahahaha. Hakkar, I'm coming for you!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am troubled with the Attack power of this weapon. Strength will be multiplied with buffs in a raid, where Attack power is not.<br /><br />when you devide the attackpower in 2, you get the strength it would do, but it wont be multiplied. So its 36 strength, but not multiplied by the Gift of the wild.<br /><br />Therefor i think this weapon is not so good for a warrior. I have the Manslayer of the Qiray, which has 35 strength and i think its better for PvE</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hunter first, then Warrior, then Pally. There are better weapons for the melee classes but this is the best 2hander for hunters in game.<br />Warriors get real. +power is clearly a hunter stat and along with +sta they are some of the most important things a weapon can give them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think this is great for any class that can get thier hands on it ie Warriors, PAllies and yes hunter's (oh yeah shammys for the hord i think) most of you ppl who say Hunter weaponf ZOMG of Warrior FTW probalby think i'm an idiot cuz well i don't agree with either of you. The attack power any class can use adn the stamin well every body loves stamina case closed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay jeez...<br />Pali... prolly not. <br />Warrior definitely<br />Hunter definitely...<br /><br />That added attack power goes into Ranged too...<br />so just having that thing equiped means a hunters arrows do more damage... stfu noobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would give this to a pally ONLY if the MT or any other warrior does not need it or want it. Or course it would go to the warriors first, not even a question.<br /><br />But of course, if the warrior has Ashkandi, which is basically the same as this weapon, just better, this should definetly go to a pally or another warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To the nub who thinks that hunters are crit dependant...do you play a hunter? I got this sword the day I hit 60 on my hunter...very nice...72 ap with a +25 agil enchant makes for some serious ap. Um...as far as Lok'Delar...it's actually not as good as Zin...if it were they'd give it to hunters on the test realms...but they dont. Hunters usually get Zin because of the AP and +25 agil chant. Luckily for me it was a non dkp run that I got it on...it isnt cheap</div>
