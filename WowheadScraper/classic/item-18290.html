Hunters need a higher hit % chance than that however to ensure their tranq shot hits Magmadar every time (and also just handy in general for boss fights). It is indeed 9% needed as the miss chance increases by 1.2% per level&nbsp; above 60 (i forget where that comes from tbh..)&nbsp; and Magmadar is set at lvl 63 (3x1.2 =3.6,&nbsp; 3.6+5=8.6 so safer to be at 9%). \n\nIt's possible to get 9% even if you've just started doing ZG\/AQ20 as if you manage to get a Zulian Tigerhide Cloak that gives 1%, Fahrad's Reloading Repeater from The Perfect Poison quest gives another 1% and if you have 3 out of 4 pieces of the Black Dragonscale set (which you would ideally be using in MC for the first steps in there) that gives you another 1% to hit. That leaves you another 1% to aim for and I'm just going by what I have personally been equipped with so far.

It dropped once on a normal farm of MC ( Molten Core ) And i was over the moon when i saw it in the Raid chat! :D<br /><br />It's really good to make for a hunters bow or gun, Not really that much use for any other class. Unless you have the gold for the mats, or the time to farm them. The mats are very expensive and hard to come by. But i would seriously recomend that every hunter has this scope attached to a DECENT ( Over lvl 55+ ) weapon!<br /><br />The Average price of this scope can vary from 400g - 600g, Some people might even charge more. And it will cost on average for the mats around 300g - 350g to make one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7024</b></h3>Unless you are low on +hit gear this scope is pretty much not worth it (infact it would be cheaper to get you more +hit gear then to make this scope). Sniper scope is far more feasible to have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>amita</b></h3>I have this on my xbow and my bow, It works great since before I use to miss 4x in BWL. Besides that it's expensive to make.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Golemagg in MC.&nbsp; Dropped tonight (06-27-06) on Twisting Nether server... no posts on here, and didn't say where it dropped.. so thought I'd say.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is going to cost over 350g on Frostmane for mats. This is for your last weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dropped for me this weekend from Baron Geddon - being raid engineer, I got it (and only 5dkp, so not really breaking the dkp bank either).<br /><br />Crazy materials, really. The only real reason you'd use this is to show off I guess. +3% might be nice, but is it really worth all those materials?<br /><br />Maybe with some of the very VERY high-end ranged weapons... but not until.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, I'm trying to understand if a +3% increase in hit is even that great, I mean.... I assuming hunters would be the most likely to use this item, but yeah... I guess it's better than +7 damage. &gt;&lt; How much do you guys miss...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think its better then the 7 dmg cause ...you know its just 7 :P dosent matter THAT much, but with 3% hit you cannot practicaly miss a thing, maybe once a year but still its very good. And to think when you miss youre aimed shot -.- thats soo annoying. For the mats....eh...you rly need a good epic ranged weapon and its worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, i've seen some real mathmatics on this issue. Can +7dmg scope at 3G be better or worse then a +3 hit at around 400G be worth it. I mean i'm about to put the biznicks one on my gun, but can anyone give me a reason why i shouldn't (besides the costs of the cores ((we run MC cores are nothing to us)), can you prove either way on eiher scope for truth. Come on work out the math skills and make everyone understand it. If were wasting our time on these stupid scopes, let everyone know. Here's your chance to be a hero.<br /><br />Mychael NE Hunter<br />Garona<br />Bad Mojo Guild</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, this schematic isn't new to MC or World of Warcraft. It was existant from the very release of the game, but then removed by the developers, because the +hit was affecting melee attacks too, what never was intended by the devs. Now that it's back, i wonder whether they changed something with it or found it to be fine.<br /><br />Some confirmed-data-based answers would be fine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>more accurate calculation than the one shown above is if you take into account the hunters special abilities. a hunter doing the aim-multi-cycle will have <br /><br />avgdps=(basedps+aim+multi)/time<br /><br />each term must take into account modifiers such as crit%, speedfactors, +dmg and talents.<br /><br />basedps = (weapondmg+bonusdmg+attackpower/14)*speedfactor*(1+crit%*Mortalshot)<br /><br />bonusdmg = ammobonus+scopebonus<br /><br />ammobonus can be for instance +13dps while scopebonus is (7/weaponspeed) dps (it says it adds damage not damage pr second like the ammo does).<br /><br />aimshot and multishot have similar but a tidbit more complicated formulas.<br /><br />the point is, you have to take account of the bonusdmg from the scope in all formulas, and they get modified and factorized for crits and wpnspeeds.<br /><br />the final result will have to be modified by your chance to miss/hit which will diminish the overall damage.<br /><br />running a couple examples with around 1300 ap and 20% crit gives result with %hit scope ~6dps above the sniper scope.<br /><br />higher ap and crit makes %hit even more important.<br /><br />the weaponspeed also effects the result, but the overall result is that the %hit scope will give a small benefit. if it's worth it or not depends on how rich you are and also on whether or not you have max hit% from other gear. (some say 9% hit is enough for both pve and pvp, although i have no clue where that number is coming from).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>one good use for this scope on hunters is to help with tranqing bosses. having + to hit helpscus a missed tranq even for a second can cause a tank to die, so most high end guilds try to have at least +8 to hit on hunters that tranq, so this scope is awesome when combined with strikers mark or crossbow of smiting (giving +4 to hit all together)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you're taking your first steps into raiding here's my theory based on experience, as a Hunter :- <br /><br />Assume you're at lvl 60 with no racial bonus and 300 weapon skill (be it bow, crossbow or gun) you have a 95%&nbsp; chance to hit a lvl 60 mob, not including surefooted talents from the survival tree. <br />It's more than possible to achieve the extra 5% needed to make this 100% hit rate through the survival talents and doing a few Dire Maul tribute runs for 2 tarnished elven rings (1% hit chance each). Hunters need a higher hit % chance than that however to ensure their tranq shot hits Magmadar every time (and also just handy in general for boss fights). It is indeed 9% needed as the miss chance increases by 1.2% per level&nbsp; above 60 (i forget where that comes from tbh..)&nbsp; and Magmadar is set at lvl 63 (3x1.2 =3.6,&nbsp; 3.6+5=8.6 so safer to be at 9%). <br /><br />It's possible to get 9% even if you've just started doing ZG/AQ20 as if you manage to get a Zulian Tigerhide Cloak that gives 1%, Fahrad's Reloading Repeater from The Perfect Poison quest gives another 1% and if you have 3 out of 4 pieces of the Black Dragonscale set (which you would ideally be using in MC for the first steps in there) that gives you another 1% to hit. That leaves you another 1% to aim for and I'm just going by what I have personally been equipped with so far. I intend to get the zandalar predators belt from the ZG primal hakkari item hand in quest as soon as I'm honored which adds the final % needed for me :-)<br /><br />So at the end of the day, this scope is not really needed if you've equipped yourself similarly to how I have so far.&nbsp; I have no idea what kind of hit % chance there is on the rest of the tier1/2 gear and items that complement those sets, as I've only really just started MC with my guild, so I can't comment on the �Hardcore Raiding� aspect (BWL, AQ40 Naxx).. I wouldn't consider this scope just yet anyways. And it's all just my opinion, hoping it may help some of you out there :-)</div>
