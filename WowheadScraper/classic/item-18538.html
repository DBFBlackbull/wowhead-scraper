There is also another talent that improves the chance to make a critical with an axe (remember THIS IS AN AXE) by 5% more percent. A warrior who wants to do some damage (that means all warriors because he's doing nearly nothing dmg) will chose a axe. He also has 5% by default and  and 3% percent by his agi and other items. That makes a chance of 20%. And with a speed of 2.70 this means the warrior would do all 13.5 seconds in average a critical that is 20% more effective than criticals of other classes.

First off this more of a warrior item due to the fact warriors A) use 2h axes for crits B) this has a plus 2% to crit which is good for everyone but warriors get nice rage boosts due to crits (twice the amount) and therefore in order to use specials like MS need the rage and need the crits to use specials faster C) the stats are favored to paladins shamens and warriors but hunters who may like the extra stam but strength is wasted on the hunter imo\n\nso basically this isnt really a favored hunter.

With some crit gear stacked with the axe's +crit you'll find yourself critting once every 3 swings or so.  \n\nPvP though, the reaper is leaps and bounds better than Treant's.  In PvE you'll find that fights last long enough for the +crit to materialize and make the dps difference.  In PvP you'll rarely see fights lasting longer than 10 seconds, you need the heavy burst damage that the reaper delivers.\n\nThose are my finding with 2 weeks use and testing with Treant's and the reaper.\n\nEdited, Tue Jul 12 13:48:36 2005","date":"2005-07-12T17:40:02-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"fbdash","importedSubject":"As A Warrior"},{"commentv2":1,"number":116,"id":3066644,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Everyone here has stated something that's... stupid.

Here let me show you 2 weapons that blow this out of the water for your class.    It's rediculous that you would pretty much say a hunter is not allowed to have an epic melee weapon because he's not supposed to be meleeing.\n\nThe LOW attack speed is plenty of a reason for a warrior to pass, their skills woould beinifit more off even a doomsaw.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have never heard that &amp;*!@ like here. This is that defintley a warrior weapon. Have you ever played a warrior and have you had math in school?<br />All stats of this weapons are showing that this is a warrior weapon. The damage is clear. strength and stamina aswell. You hunters mean a hunter would need the 5% critical? A warrior needs quite more. A hunter if he is good nearly never gets into a melee battle. But a warrior is fighting always with his weapon. A warrior has a skill to improve the damage of his critical strikes by 20%. (I think that tells you all..that means there is a 20% more useage of a critical then a hunter..but there is quite more). The warrior has a talent to improve the chance on critical by 5%. There is also another talent that improves the chance to make a critical with an axe (remember THIS IS AN AXE) by 5% more percent. A warrior who wants to do some damage (that means all warriors because he's doing nearly nothing dmg) will chose a axe. He also has 5% by default and and 3% percent by his agi and other items. That makes a chance of 20%. And with a speed of 2.70 this means the warrior would do all 13.5 seconds in average a critical that is 20% more effective than criticals of other classes. And you say its a hunter weapon, who is in worst case 50% in a melee battle?</div>

There's a HUGE difference between a warrior and rogue rolling on a ranged weapon and a hunter rolling on a melee weapon. We melee around 35% of the time while u range about .01% of the time. This is just another weapon to add to the hunter's &quot;don't roll on bin.&quot; It's not like warriors don't have dozens of choices for 2H weapons at this point in the game while we have very few besides some $%^&amp; greens and the barbarous blade, too bad some warrior or pally would say &quot;why would a hunter roll on that?&quot; if i rolled on the barbarous blade.</div>

So...)<br />The hunters clairly want this weapon only for the 2%crit chance. Don't bother us talking about you need high dps for meleeing as an hunter.<br />I can't really understand why someone is also calling this as a paladin's weapon.<br />Since when paladins need to do any damage ? they need %crit chance ? rofl.<br />Let the paladins do what they are designed for plz. Shield and 1h.<br /><br />In any group this must be rolled first by a shaman or warrior. Then by an hunter.<br />Any pally ninja rolling on this must be simply kicked out the party and blacklisted.

To be honest, I was kinda mad I didn't loot it as it probably disenchants into 3 shards, like all other epics. Instead all I have is a lousy screenshot I took after opening the tribute :(.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Even counting in the massive STR bonus and the +2 crit, the truth is that this is a halfassed weapon for any serious DD warrior; it is <i>far too fast</i>. Hunters pallys shamans whoever are welcome to roll. Looks nice though!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Best axe that doesnt require you to be in an MC/BWL guild, and Raid every day. Id get this in a heartbeat if i could. Plus i wouldent have to give up my Arms spec to get into protection, Get maxed out defense skill and then find an MC raiding guild. Much better IMO for casual gamers that cant/dont want to get into an MC guild.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok first off i think that anyone that can use this axe has a right to roll but AFTER discussion with the people in the group. First off this more of a warrior item due to the fact warriors A) use 2h axes for crits B) this has a plus 2% to crit which is good for everyone but warriors get nice rage boosts due to crits (twice the amount) and therefore in order to use specials like MS need the rage and need the crits to use specials faster C) the stats are favored to paladins shamens and warriors but hunters who may like the extra stam but strength is wasted on the hunter imo<br /><br />so basically this isnt really a favored hunter. Hunters should go get 2 dawns edge and then swap them out for a better weapon in close range combat. Its less costly and you still get the crit chance bonus with out having to go get an epic. Paladins have the same right to roll on this as a warrior but, again i would have to say that this is more of a warrior weapon than the other classes. I dont know enough bout the shamen class to say whether or not its a good weapon for them so i will not go there.<br /><br />so a break down would be this (rating of 1-10 1 being lowest 10 highest)<br /><br />warrior- 10 this is very much a warrior weapon<br />paladin- 9 stats and damage justify it being good for paladins<br />hunter- 6 this really isnt the best weapon for ya<br />shamen- ? dunno but i think i would say an 8 cause you dont always tank. i dunno dont take this rating seriously</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Quote: &quot;You say melle dps dosent matter, then why do you eaven need attackpower you dumb **** ? Attackpower is NOT ranged power, learn that.&quot; <br />Actually, thats incorrect, attack power bonuses from gear affect melee AND ranged attack power which in turn increases constant damage done, which is a given as opposed to a percentage chance that you'll critical strike an opponent. Nice try though</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dunno, I think that if this dropped, I would really want it, it's a hell of a lot better than my Twig of the world tree on my war XD.... Dont get me wrong, If a hunter or shammy rolled on it, I wouldnt be mad, I can see why either class would want it, but to say that its not a good warrior weapon is complete BS</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I know a Fury/Arms Warrior using this right now in MC, and his Damage is ridiculous, usually coming out 6-10% over the rest of the Raid, and that's percent of the Entire Raid's Damage... He's unstoppable in Single Target DPS compared to his Guildmates (who are slackers by any means).<br /><br />He's a badass Warrior to begin with, but when he got this I knew he was going to Annihilate... He has an Unstoppable Force, but uses this for the fact that the Flurry Procs are great for Rage Management ( -Wep Spd = +Hits = +Rage), and he enjoys the +6 Str over the tUF. He also said he gets tired of seeing &quot;Immune&quot; on targets when the tUF procs, since like... nothing... in MC is Stunnable.<br /><br />Anyway, that's my 2 cents, hope it helps someone. GL getting it, and cheers to those lucky enough to have it already.</div>

If a warrior or rogue rolled on an epic ranged weapon, I'd try to see them blacklisted from raids.<br /><br />Try to cooperate here, people.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>basically what it boils down to is if you are a hunter an you can upgrade by getting this, you are gonna roll. yea it may be deutche to the warrior but how can you condemn a person for rolling for an item that they can use and will benefit them. its not a priest ninja-ing it its a hunter who will be better as a result of weilding the axe.<br /><br />and as for the person who calls everyone noobs and said something about his guildmates and partying, go fcuk yourself. if you make fun of noobs you are just an *!@#$%^ and you are probably not well liked in real life. calm down and your E-hardon will eventually subside. go play FFXI for the first time and you'll be a noob, and you wouldn't like some arrogant @#$%^ who probably lives with his parents and has never touched a vagina callig you a noob just because you are trying to learn the game they have &quot;mastered.&quot;<br /><br />save your dignity and don't post a reply</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'll start this off by saying that I am a lvl 60 warrior. With that bias in mind I believe this is first and foremost a warrior weapon and if a warrior is in the group (which on horde side is basically guarenteed) he should have first dibs on it as he gets the *most* use out of it. Sure hunters get the 2% crit chance off of it, but as has been said before, 2 dawn's edges give that exact same bonus. And yes some hunters melee a fair amount, however their true power lies in their ranged attacks thus the DPS is not near as useful.<br /><br />For a warrior, and expecially a crit specced one, this is one of the best swords in the game (only comparable to other lvl 60ish epic swords). For a hunter this is a very very good sword however the stats that it gives can be gotten on other much easier to find weapons. Basically I can see why a hunter would want this (it's a great hunter 2hdr) but if a hunter in my group beats me on a roll for this I will be pissed becuase it is moer useful to me.</div>

If you got a pickup group, and its in there, good luck deciding who gets it, cause either way, someone is gunna get blacklisted.<br /><br />I'm a hunter and I'm gunna get it. Sooner or later.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Shaman/Paladin weapon.<br /><br />Warriors: not for MS buddy - get a reaper or Unstoppable Force.<br />Hunters: Barbarous Blade is better with a slower bow, the best bow you can get is slow, therefore shh (I asked an experienced MC hunter about this).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I agree that it is good for any class that can use it. However, I would roll on this as a warrior.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well, hunters want agi and crit chance. I think two dawns edges and +agi enchants would be better for them. Dont start ranting about bigger wingclips. 95% or more of your damage is ranged.<br /><br />Paladins would want this very much indeed. I think axes are warrior weapons first. They can have all swords and maces for all I care. If I was in a guild raid with a paladin friend, Id have to think hard about it.<br /><br />I currently use a reaper, and this axe would do 44 less damage per hit, and reduce the MS crits somewhat, but lets face it. 2% crit on a weapon is huge. <br /><br />Call me greedy if you want. I still get more DPS out of it than any other class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, most pallys won't be rolling on this, at least if they have half a brain because of the fast speed. The relatively fast 2h speed A: reduces SoC proc rate(per swing) and B: reduces SoC damage per proc over the ice barbed spear, Arcanite reaper, or The Unstoppable Force. Most warriors would be better of getting a weapon swap macro and hitting overpower with the arcanite reaper than going for this beast. Hunters actualy get just as much out of ir as warriors do, since it increases their damage (+2% Crit) and their HP total. Also telling hunters who are in smaller guilds that might not even be able to run through ZG to go Kill Azuregos for the typhoon is just wasting your breath, although Typhoon is a superior weapon to this for hunters, and perhaps many fury warriors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is the second best hunter weapon out there. The other is out epic staff, however, the staff can also be the one of the best bows in the game. If a hunter had this, he would be set forever.<br /><br />Pros: 2% crit, which yes is around 106-8 agility worth, but doesnt bring the attackpower agility does. its about 10 less dps from 100 ap loss. however hunters have a very small base crit, and we are the only class with a skill that gives all (ranged) crits 50% more damage (reduced to 30% in the next patch). Which in the end makes the most important proc.<br /><br />15 stamina = 150.. which equals a few more seconds to feign death, or get healed.<br /><br />And at last the probably best pro reason. Strength. As some posted before me, hunters are not all ranged. It all depends on the situation, and mostly who you are fighting. 25strength = 50 ap for me. which basicly is 10% more ap on my melee. Hunters are very in melee too. And we have to use it more than often because our crit pulls the targets of our pets.<br /><br />I'd roll on this axe anyday of the week with my hunter. And thats that. However few will probably ever get the chance. :( <br /><br />Edited, Thu Aug 18 10:19:11 2005</div>

I am a prot spec warrior but i still do DPS when i get tired of tanking. I am not going to argue with you guys over anything because i believe ya but the 2% to crit is huge to someone woh doesn't have all the talents into arms/fury like one speced wholy in them</div>

With some crit gear stacked with the axe's +crit you'll find yourself critting once every 3 swings or so. <br /><br />PvP though, the reaper is leaps and bounds better than Treant's. In PvE you'll find that fights last long enough for the +crit to materialize and make the dps difference. In PvP you'll rarely see fights lasting longer than 10 seconds, you need the heavy burst damage that the reaper delivers.<br /><br />Those are my finding with 2 weeks use and testing with Treant's and the reaper.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Jul 12 13:48:36 2005</div>

Here let me show you 2 weapons that blow this out of the water for your class. It's rediculous that you would pretty much say a hunter is not allowed to have an epic melee weapon because he's not supposed to be meleeing.<br /><br />The LOW attack speed is plenty of a reason for a warrior to pass, their skills woould beinifit more off even a doomsaw. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't get mad at them for rolling, but if I were a warrior I'd be trying for a different blade.<br /><br />You are all the greedy ones.<br /><br />Shamans - Earthshaker(<a href="/classic/item=17073/earthshaker">Earthshaker</a> stfu, it drops off the 2nd boss in MC if you can't get there or aren't working on getting there... /gquit<br /><br />Warriors - Treant's is a childs toy compared to the Obsidian Edged Blade (<a href="/classic/item=18822/obsidian-edged-blade">Obsidian Edged Blade</a> garr in mc, 4th boss also easy.<br /><br />Lets see... other epic swords that would be good for hunters.<br /><br />Runeblade of Baron Rivendere (<br /><a href="/classic/item=13505/runeblade-of-baron-rivendare">Runeblade of Baron Rivendare</a> sword could be really useful for kiting depending on how big the difference is.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>one thing im doing for my shaman is making him twink at every BG lvl except 19...cuz i didnt get to use 2h weps. im looking forward to getting this b/c i like the insane crit off this, if anyone wants to help me make the ultimate enhancement shammy twink on bronzebeard, then hit up ieatdwarves, right now he's doing 49 and even though he's wearing a few greens, no one has beaten me 1 on 1, even the full on twinks. and if some of u new shamans need some help for leveling, hit me up for some info cuz i havent died taking on quadruple teams pve either :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JBZboneman</b></h3>It's a godly 2H fury warrior weapon. I normally wouldn't agree with being a 2H fury warrior but the 2.70 weapon speed voids that out completely. If you're horde and roll orc and get this thing as a warrior, you're blessed. You only need 6% hit cap and even less if youre pvping.. leaving more gear slots open to stack crit. You can achieve 30+ crit % chance unbuffed if you put the work in to get the proper gear/enchants to surround this axe. It's just beast and so fun to use in both pvp and pve. Can't beat the way it looks either.. so badass.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Whosthechicken</b></h3>Be warned, enchants look like ass on this thing in Classic. The enchant glow &quot;box&quot; seems to be copied from a sword, so only the middle part of the axe will glow: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hDkepel.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/hDkepel.png</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>YaroWoW</b></h3>Just sold this for a 100G (phase 5). Someone mentioned 250G was possible before phase 5</div>
