I got the recipe on my 11 rogue while killing some razormanes for the quest, I was in a party with someone else and asked if I could have it and got it.sent it to my level 13 hunter who was just starting on cooking.  Lol, I made about 100-150 roasted boar meats getting skills up because I had a bunch of them sitting around for whenever I wanted to get skill up.  Anyway, I got the recipe learned and now all I have to do is get fishing skill up to however high you have to have it to fish at the wailing caverns and start making money.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Salus</b></h3>Feeling bored of your characer, fed up of the same looks. Eat these. I like the ninja, makes a nice change from my NE priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>22969</b></h3>This is a great money maker. I suppose the market is mostly hard-core raiders, lazy people, or just those that can't get ahold of the recipe (on Alliance side, since the recipe is a pretty rare drop from the Barrens).<br /><br />At the moment, stacks are going for around 28g. If you end up with an uneven stack, split it into 1's and 5's, and increase the markup slightly. Often people will buy just a few, get addicted, and buy full stacks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>37088</b></h3>Heh heh, so true. I got the recipe on my 11 rogue while killing some razormanes for the quest, I was in a party with someone else and asked if I could have it and got it.sent it to my level 13 hunter who was just starting on cooking. Lol, I made about 100-150 roasted boar meats getting skills up because I had a bunch of them sitting around for whenever I wanted to get skill up. Anyway, I got the recipe learned and now all I have to do is get fishing skill up to however high you have to have it to fish at the wailing caverns and start making money. Was kind of nice to get it because i'll be able to make money for mounts for all my characters. I would recomend farming the lower level razormanes (10-13 or whatever) because there is a fair amount of them in a spot and they are pretty fast respawns. Gl all who are farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had alot of fun with this. Just got my cooking up before the open beta ended and made a bunch. Effects I experienced were Yaarr as posted above. Also Flip Out, another disguise that looked sorta like a human ninja, with an hour timer. Also sometimes it would turn me into a blob for 10 seconds. Another benificial buff was Fast Casting, I think it was called, a 2 minute buff that halved casting time. Got Feign Death a few times, though mostly I resisted it... and one more negative result from using the Food was a fear effect that lasted 10 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So far I've catalogued the following effects from eating the fish:<br /><br />(60 min) Yaaarrrr (turns you into a pirate)<br />(60 min) Flip Out (turns you into a ninja)<br />(10 sec) Oops (turns you into a pile of goo)<br />(2 min) Rapid Cast<br />(10 min) Cowardice (causes 5sec &quot;Run Away&quot; fear)<br />(insta) +50 Rage (Warriors Only)<br />(5 min) Fake Death</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just a note, I got fake death using this and I stayed &quot;dead&quot; for the entire duration without moving. After the &quot;fake&quot; death effect expired, I actually died and got the &quot;Release Spirit&quot; prompt and had to do a corpse run. Kind of embarassing to have to do a CR to Ogrimmar. Anyhow, I put in a ticket because I thought it was a bug and the GM told me the effect is intentional. I doubt anyone except me will be patient or stupid enough to sit through the whole five minute effect, but just in case.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'd been halfheartedly farming for this for a few days; this morning, I decided to switch onto my alt and do some fishing.&nbsp; I killed a couple of Snapjaws for the heck of it, and on the second or third turtle, out of nowhere- there it was!&nbsp; :D&nbsp; <br /> i've killed Spearhide twice and a half-dozen Wooly Kodos (and an elite kodo named Brontus or something of the sort, twice,) but no luck with them.&nbsp; Guess drop rates aren't everything.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As of 1.6 patch, all effects of eating this except for ninja/pirate shifts seem to have been removed. In a stack of 20, none of them failed to grant a shapeshifting effect. This means you no longer have to give several of them to your friend(s) each to ensure that they are transformed. <br /><br />I handed my other stack out for free in Orgrimmar. There were many jokes, and much drinking of Bourbon occured. <br /><br />Random facts- <br />1. The affect no longer vanishes when you log out, switch continents, or go through an instance. <br />2. It does vanish when you die. <br />3. You can't mount or use flight paths. <br />4. If you must use a mount, you can dispell the effect by right-clicking the buff icon by your map. This goes for nearly all buffs, but I mention it because some people don't know. You will not be able to change back without consuming another Deviate Delight.<br />5. Skeleton form (Noggenfogger) will overwrite the effect. Use with caution if you hope to shrink yourself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hmm they made this just a fun item now. lol. and in WoW alot of ppl pay for fun items. &quot;Orb of Deception&quot; also seems to be &quot;just&quot; a fun item. <br />So now Savory Deviate Delight is just a costume fun. <br />me and my friend always enjoy it. Its not useless. its for fun, a game is for fun, not everything has to have a useful need for you be sucessful like getting equip and stuff =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My friends and I ate a bunch and yes you can change genders.&nbsp; My friend changed from a male tauren shaman to a female ninja.&nbsp; He said really funny stuff and sounded like a man who had recently had a sex change.&nbsp; &quot;Estrogen?&nbsp; What is that?&nbsp; Can you eat it?&quot;&nbsp; All kinds of really funny stuff.&nbsp; I ate tons of them but never changed into a guy.&nbsp; Anyone else?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When I ate the raw fish alone I got the buff 'Party fever' or something which obviously puts you into the party fever. I was randomly clapping, laughing, doing the chicken dance and all sorts :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can someone confirm a rumour for me?<br /><br />I heard that during the hotfix for Blackwing Lair, they nerfed Deviate Delights so they would only give Pirate/Ninja form, and not have any of the other effects (quick cast, fear, feign death etc...), can someone confirm this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These fish have become all the rage lately. They sell very well at usually 50s to 60s each. I tend to sell them in stacks of 5 or more. The polymorph effects Flip Out and Yarrr last for 60 minutes. Everything is normall except your animations and you can not mount when polymorphed. Unless you find the recipe yourself, expect to pay 60g to 100g on the Perenolde server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this Recipe for 5.5g lol it really helped get my cooking skill up...<br /><br />and now my fishing is at 200 :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a fun recipe.<br /><br />It's not for combat, but it's fun at parties!<br /><br />When you eat it, it has random effects. Here is a list of everything it has done so far for me. (I've eaten about 40 of em so far)<br /><br />-Illusion of a human pirate (you really look like a pirate for 1 hour!)<br />-Illusion of a human ninja for 1 hour<br />-Illusion of a green ooze for only about 10 seconds<br />-Fake Death (just like a hunter) lasts for about 2 minutes or until you move<br />-Instant 20-40 Rage (for anyone who has rage)<br />-Fast Casting (for 60 seconds, all spells you cast only take half the time to cast)<br />-Fear (you get feared and run around for 5 seconds and then have the fear icon where your buffs are for 10 minutes, but I haven't noticed it do anything after you stop running around)<br />-Nothing (every once and a while, it doesn't do anything when you eat it.) This could be the instant heal that people have talked about. But I'm always full health when I eat these.<br /><br />It only takes one deviate fish and one mild spice to cook per piece of deviate delight. <br /><br />The deviate fish can be fished up in wailing caverns. You can even fish them in the instance. Thats the smart way to do it so no alliance will gank you while you are fishing. Because they like to fish in there too for the deviate fish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've seen some sell this for 80s each... :S</div>

There is one that has been up for 3 days for 50g. At first glance, I thought this was the same one. I scrolled down some more, then back up, and noticed that it wasn't 50s. At this point I did a double-take to make sure my eyes weren't being mean to me. 2s! I nearly let out a yelp when I saw this listed for 2s. I, of course, bought it out, and am now trying to resell it, so if anyone on Lothar is interested, whisper me on the character 'Sinassassin' or send me a letter, and I'll get back with you.</div>
