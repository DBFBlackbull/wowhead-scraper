Not very impressive as MH I would say though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skitzosmeagol</b></h3>Im sure if your warriors are tanking they would probably be using something like the sword of faerlina. Dragonfang blade was not intended for a off hand dagger it is to slow 1.8 speed is not fast... get something fast like maybe core hound off hand. DFB should always be mainhand unless you get something with higher top end damage. Also this dagger drops off of Vaelastraz. Not the highest drop rate in the world.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9631</b></h3>Well it used to be REALLY good for hunters but since the patch it ain't all that great. You can get weapons even from easier instances that provide you with more ranged attack power, thus boosting your damage a lot more than this blade. It should better be left for dagger rogues and/or dps warriors, in my humble opinion</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow, are you stupid? A rogue has so many instant abilities that you don't need a fast dagger to proc poison! you need a SLOW dagger so you're sinister strike, ghostly strike, backstab, riposte, and ambush do more damage! Wow, it amazes me how people who don't know anything about a class can think they do. The amount of damage your weapons do is multiplied by the speed of your weapon, hence attacks that do a percentage of the weapon damage (ambush is 250%) is multiplied by the speed, and the slower the speed the more damage. DUH!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's really a nice dagger...Both for rogues and hunters.<br /><br />Gotta save me points and bid on it^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Chill people, I have a hunter and a rogue. Both would benefit by this weapon. Obviously, and sadly for us poor hunters, rogues get first shot at this. If no rogue needed it then it should go to a hunter. But, good luck finding a MC group without a rogue that wouldn't want this. <br /><br />Think about it fellow hunters.. We can get any 1H sword dagger or axe with a good agility buff and come out with only slightly less agility. You are talking about the difference of 2 or 3 DPS on your ranged attack when a rogue would likely be getting a 10 DPS melee boost from this weapon. Plus you have to consider the dagger factor since a dagger in the main hand is necessary for certain rogue moves.<br /><br />Another weapon like Doom's Edge axe, now that is a little more controversial. No dagger factor and most rogues dont mess with axes. Technically still go to rogue but aagh, hunters SHOULD be able to have access to weapons that will allow them to peak too. Kinda sucks for us hunters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fancy, stop coming in all of the dagger forums and posting that daggers are good for warriors with fury spec, sure it might be good for alot of classes with ONE, or TWO talents, but several rogue skills center around daggers which is why so many people think your an idiot. Daggers like this should first go to rogues becuase they can make the best use out of it, it's not like any rogues are posting in the forum for every sword, saying that they would have high SS damage and becuase of thier build they would be so much better when there are weapons that are alot better. And before anyone flames me for saying it's a class weapons, OMG hunter weapon, this will make me crit more and it looks sweet! Ima ninja it cuase im teh best l33t hunter ever who sits back in PvP and just get's the final shot so I lead the kill chart, and I say every other weapon with agility is mine even if I can't use yet since I can use anything! &gt;.&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes, and please name a rogue that's going to use this in their offhand. and if they have something better in their offhand, they should give this to someone else.<br /><br />You guys are stupid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I always love coming on here and reading the posts of so many arguments saying, this is my weapon, no it's mine...<br /><br />Any guild that has gotten to this point, first off, has a DKP system implemented. Second, is every rogue that spends dkp on this is going to be massive amounts, because that's how much it's worth to them. Hunters might throw down a little, I don't care. So it rarely comes to the point when a hunter would get this before all rogues are equipped with it. Either that or the rogue simply doesn't want it, we have a few...<br /><br />Taking down Razor tonight, I can see this dagger in my grasp, and will spend ALL DKP on it. As will a few other rogues, then the hunters/warriors/whoever can have dibs on it. And as stated before, if a hunter did decide to go all out on this, he would thoroughly piss off a few members. I'm an officer, don't want to do that ;)<br /><br />So I'm not saying this is a rogue weapon, but come on, use common sense...<br /><br />kthxbye,<br />Arc</div>

(By the way, that's the second boss in BWL, past the room of eggs that all 100% of 60s that are attuned have seen)</div><br /><br />well then, your are what i like to call, a tard. The fact is it doesnt matter what the stats are on the weapon since damage doesnt matter when tanking cept for the white dmg and faster weapons generate enough of that, not to mention the faster the weapon the more you hit the more rage you get:<br /><br />Serrar = outdated tanking weapon it just aint that good there are better.<br /><br />Spineshatterer = Seen old people screw faster than this thing hits<br /><br />Brutality/Viskag - same as spineshatter<br /><br />this weapon i agree is good for rogues its also a viable tanking weapon and one of the best imo, less you know how to tank you a hunteri dont think you do i suggest you stfu talking about things you dont understand kkthx noob</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have a 60 hunter and no... hunters don't even come close in priority to a rogue in owning this weapon. Let me put it this way, the dmg range base in itself gives rogues the priority. Rogues, like warriors, have instant abilities that do weapon dmg +etc... There is absolutely no reason for a hunter to own this thing. Why not just get bone slicing hatchet instead? Freakin noobs hunters...exactly why our class is hated so much. <br /><br />For all you people say I would roll, shut up, get to 60 and then post. There is no such thing as &quot;rolling&quot; in MC, BWL, etc. If you have no idea what I am talking about, keep leveling until you do. Until then, this is a rogue weapon just as much an arcanite reaper is a warrior weapon. Saying an arcanite reaper is just as much a hunter weapon because of the +AP only makes you look like an idiot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, pretty sure this message is gonna get lost in the great masses here but I'll give it a try. Most raiding guilds use DKP (Dragon Kill Points; given for attendance to raids mainly) these in one way or another are spent on getting items from raids. Pretty simple, right? Now then, yes I know my guild does assign priority. Tankish weapons to tanks, daggers/swords to rogue and ranged weapons to hunters. Now then, what happens when those classes no longer want the item, this dagger for example, one of two things happen in a DKP enviroment... A) It get's disenchanted for yummy nexus crystals (this is usually perditions fate now)... B) Another class might take intresst in it, and yes we hunters are very intressted in this at this point, it's very nice for stats-- and hey, some of us DO stab things occasionally, mainly squirrels (we like seeing big numbers)... Now before there is anymore talking of ballkicking or the like, think, many guilds have been clearing BWL a lot, and by now, it has infact found it's way to hunters and they didn't even have to shaft a rogue to get it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>coming from a Paladin. Hunters DO NOT melee nearly as much as rogues, and if you do...then you're poorly playing your class. No raid leader will even give Hunters the option to spend their DKP on this. There are better weapons out there for Warriors that are easier to get.<br /><br />Even if I could use daggers, I wouldn't touch it because it's blatantly made for rogues. Just because it doesn't say &quot;Classes: Rogue&quot; doesn't mind it wasn't specifically designed for a certain class. Lightforge armor is plate and is loaded with Int, Warriors can use plate, does that mean that they have the right to Lightforge set pieces over a Paladin? Since, you know...it doesn't say &quot;Classes: Paladin&quot;.<br /><br />Sit the @#$% down, tool.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dont think anyone here has seen the benefits of a dagger to a Warrior. If a warrior is fury specced instead of arms he/she will have Bloodthirst, which is based on attack power, instead of Mortal Strike, which is based on weapon damage. For Bloodthirst, it doesn't matter how hard your weapon hits because the damage it deals has absolutely nothing to do with it, in fact, a faster weapon is preferrable because Bloodthirst also replenishes health for the next 5 hits afterwards and so a faster weapon would mean faster health regen. The truth is, a fury specced warrior with dual wield crusader enchanted daggers would be very hard to kill because he would be healing himself for 100hp every 6 seconds alone on just Bloodthirst. With the crusader procs he would be healing himself for even more. This health regen added to the amount of life, armor, and damage a warrior already has/does and you can see why this is just as much a rogue weapon as a warrior weaopn.</div>

(especially since Rogues roll on things like Ancient Bone Bow every time it comes up...)<br /><br />getting these for a Hunter is not about melee, its about the stat bonuses, which is by far what a Hunter should look for in melee weapons (Hunters using Doomsaw and other such weapons are just stupid).<br /><br />while I do agree that rogue's get priority on this weapon, it shouldnt be dismissed for hunters. (i've seen groups just give good hunter weapons to the guild Enchanters to DE just because they thought it wasnt a hunter weapon, and I would hate to see that happen with something like this)<br /><br />Edited, Sun Jul 31 23:03:58 2005</div>

Right now, I could get one, but not the other until much later. Right now, I'm thinking whatever comes first because Perdition's Blade, yes has more DPS and damage, however lacks passive stats. 47 damage proc?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is no doubt good weapon for Hunters too. However no hunter or his buddies can get his hands to this beauty without strong guild. Good guild excepts it's members to work together and do their roles during raids the best they can. If a hunter would constantly rush into melee in a guild raid he would find himself without guild soon. Hunters are exceped to do high long rang damage and to stay out of melee where they could only scratch the highend elites.<br /><br />Rogues on the otherhand are mostly in close range, they backstab the highest DPS of all classes if they get into melee. In some fights however like shazzy rogue also use only ranged DPS.<br /><br />The dragonfang dagger is just as good to hunters are some kickass bow is to rogues. It can be used and might even help occasionally, but it is NOT as important to hunters as it is to rogues just as some godly bow is not as important to rogues as it is to hunters.<br /><br />If you as a hunter say you would roll the blade over a rogue you better be prepared to get some serious barking. Few points more to agility maybe increase your damage by 1-3% but rogue gains 10-30% damage increase with that dagger.<br /><br />You can say it is good weapon for a hunter, but if you say that it's a gamebreaking weapon for a hunter you are wrong, big time. For a dagger rogue on the other hand, that weapon is THE BEST weapon in the game so far released.</div>
