I killed every Naga between the island and the shore and ONLY dropped once I was on the island.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elise</b></h3>As you can see how random it is, it dropped for me after 16 kills, on the Ranazjer island. It didnt drop on the road to the island though!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>At 36,20 I found a &quot;Bubbly Fissure&quot; under the water. If you swim near it, you will gain underwater breathing while you're near it. Very useful if you're not a warlock/shaman/alchemist.<br /><br />Edit: Apparently I was killing the wrong Naga the whole time, but i'm sure you can other fissures over at the correct location.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You don't need water breathing potions, there's a big island that has plenty of tidehunters and sea witches on it.&nbsp; The middle of the island is approximately 29,8 thottbotloc, or 29% from the left of the map and 8% from the top.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, read the comment directly above for the location, it really IS the island ! LOL<br /><br />This is part 2 of the Karnitol quest...<br /><br />Upon arriving at the island I did this:<br />(remember, this is just my experience...)<br /><br />I killed 8 Tidehunters and 2 Sea Witches... it was on the last Tidehunter... also killed 1 Myrmidon, 2 Oracles, 1 Sorcerer, and 1 Deepstrider Giant Elite lvl 38.<br /><br />Aside from the quest item, the best I got was 2 Naga Scales and 4 Shiny Fish Scales, aside from crap like Fish Oil and small money...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There's no trick or tip for this quest ! Just kill the monster's they say on thottbot and the item will drop sometime...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Killed 20 odd and finally it dropped from a Sea Witch at 30,12 in the water off the island.<br /><br />Cheers Thottbot!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>THis is a very rare drop...as a lvl 37 dwarf paladin i was killing the required guys for literally over 2 hours, damn thing just wouldn't drop.&nbsp; Finally got one off of a Tidehunter...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>wow it was long but i got the quest item at the same time as my lvl 42! lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Item #1: There are multiple types of naga on the island and around it. However, only two of these five or six types will drop Karnitol's bag.<br /><br />Item #2: Two of the naga types have a nasty poison. This poison procs every five seconds and lasts for a minute, making it effectively impossible to bandage in between fights.<br /><br />Item #3: This poison effect stacks. If there is one second left on its timer and you are hit with it again, it resets to 60 seconds. Stacked twice now.<br /><br />Item #4: There are other naga around the island, but&nbsp; they are deep underwater, and travelling underwater is quite tedious, and the naga here are both spread out and hidden by foliage.<br /><br />Item #5: Oh, and there's a roving 40 elite giant with an irregular patrol pattern.<br /><br />This quest blows. If you don't get your drop after about fifteen minutes of solid grinding on the correct nagas, do yourself a favor and let this one go. I grinded four or five bars and quit it in disgust because I was about to level. And I went into this grind in such a good mood, too. Not any more. The poisons and the variety of irrelevant mobs intensifies the aggravating tedium of this drop quest.<br /><br />And then you have to swim all the way back to shore.<br /><br />&gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Prismer</b></h3>unacceptable drop rate.... i was more than an hour killing these mobss for this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>out4adance</b></h3>Got the Satchel From a Sea Witch at 32 18 after searching in the water for about 7 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mairwyn67</b></h3>All these years later and the drop rate is still woeful!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>telia222</b></h3>MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT QUEST IN THE CHAIN BEFORE FARMING FOR THIS DROP. <br /><br />This chain goes: <br />1. Get assignment from the guy in Nijel's<br />2. FIND THE CHEST ON THE SHORE<br />3. Go back to Nigel's and talk to guy<br />4. GO GET THE SATCHEL FROM THE NAGA<br /><br />You cannot get the satchel drop until you FIND THE CHEST on the shore first! I think this is the problem, people are not reading the quest carefully and are going on Wowhead, seeing the 3rd quest, and immediately going to the island. Then they don't get the drop for 1-2 hours because you're not on the right quest. It's me. I'm people. <br /><br />I hope this helps someone else not make my mistake.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nicholaa</b></h3>As of today, this quest still has garbage drop rates. The 2 mob types that can drop it don't always spawn on the island (even with killing off all the other ones) - and the ones in the water are the same way. Come out here to do The Book of the Ancients quest, but if you kill the ones that are around with no luck, I wouldn't continue to attempt to kill them for too long. Their loot table isn't really worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LordVetinari</b></h3>Just want to share my experience on a Classic Era server - got it on the 8th try, they might've fixed the drop percent to actually be 10 for Classic Era.<br /><br />Only 2 of the 5 naga types can drop it it seems. Heres the macro I used to target, mark em with purple as its most visible to locate them.<br />/target slitherblade seawitch<br />/target slitherblade tidehunter</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>auganator</b></h3>as of current its still an abhorrent drop rate. took 1hr 25min of nonstop grinding, killed about 120 mobs before i saw it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>J11mz</b></h3>Wow classic era (hc) 2023, second time grinding this in hc both time's 1h+.. writing this while waiting for respawns</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gildagger</b></h3>this is easy if you kill the correct 2 mobs. Dropped after 7 or 8 kills. The people saying it took an hour are not reading the quest for the correct mobs to kill, tidehunters and sea witches ONLY drop it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Palayen</b></h3>I am convinced Classic has introduced a bug for this quest. I farmed the two mobs on the island for over 2 hours, killed over a hundred easily. Got a BoE blue but no satchel. Following the suggestion of another, I went to the 30.9 point. Immediately the sea witch dropped it after the first kill. Blizzard absolutely !@#$ed this one, massively dropping the ball.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wootwootness</b></h3>In Wow Classic Hardcore it took me <b>1:44h to get the drop</b>. What makes it annoying is that in the island the spawns are random, and sometimes when the Nagas respawn you get mostly Razortails for example, so you have to kill all of them before Sea Witches and Tidehunters spawn again.<br /><br />Similarly to the comment by M1n1.B^ from 2007, I also killed 200+ and did not get a single green drop, only 3 grays, I agree with him: &quot;worst quest ever&quot;.<br /><br />Also the comment by telia222 is not correct. I have found the chest and completed the chest quest first. The drop rates are really abysmal.<br /><br />And to make things worse, there's a Elite 38 that patrols the area, in an irregular time. At least the addon Safeguard notified me when he appeared on screen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nosolice1</b></h3>I'm on the Classic Anni realms and oh my god this drop rate is horrendous. I've killed every Tidehunter and Sea Witch in sight over and over again and it hasn't dropped after 2 hours of farming these mobs. :')</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Katenkrad</b></h3>Whoever deisgned this quest is a monster. 4 Mobs that drop it at like 10 min respawn and the drop rate seems nonexistent.</div>
