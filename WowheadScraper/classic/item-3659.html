<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's in the town hall, guarded by Muckrake.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, true that is the best way, if you can figure out how to get in.&nbsp; Me (not being very smart) came in on the wrong hill, then ran into glamorous, who is in a house, so i had to run away from him, then you get to the church, and i hadnt seen this big guy so i went in got agrod on and got slaoghtered.&nbsp; So if you do this please try to get it right.&nbsp; And i did it with minimal problems after i figured it out, being a hunter so yes it is the easyest way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Oh yeah, that was sweet.<br /><br />To be even clearer ( I hope )<br />Go north AROUND the hill that is to the right of the main gate.<br /><br />Squeeze-hop between the hill and the northern tower.<br /><br />Determine the patrol routes of the elite creeps, and run to the house that has been ruined to its foundations.<br /><br />Continue to the rear of the city hall.( eastern side?)<br /><br />If you aggro the boss in the house to the right, just keep running behind the city hall (and hope).<br /><br />Jump up on the foundation of the city hall, and mouse around the North-Eastern back of the building till your gear turns gold. Then grab the book!<br /><br />I looked at the ramp at 38-38 and I did not even try. I just hearthstoned out. <br /><br />Total time for a level 36 mage soloing this level 38 elite quest? &lt; 120 seconds.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Whoot!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this quest is just easy...we did it normally with just me(29rogue) a 30 and 37 priest. we did perfectly fine killing the 40 elite and all the guards...this isnt even hard to solo just run and take it and get out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Worn Leather Book is in a &quot;Weathered Bookcase&quot;.&nbsp; There are several buildings inside of the Ruins of Alterac that look similar.&nbsp; The bookcase is NOT in the large building with the towers at each corner.<br /><br />I did this solo with a level 33 paladin.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you stand at the main entrance and look straight west through the broken gates, it's in the building directly ahead with the clock tower on it.<br /><br />The easiest way to get into the ruins is to start at Growless Cave where the Mountain Yetis are.&nbsp; While looking at the cave, work your way left, around the mountains.&nbsp; You will come to a plateau where you can look east at a section of the Alterac Ruins' wall.&nbsp; Right behind this wall is the large building with a tower on each corner.&nbsp; This is where you want to go in, but on the left (north) side of the wall.<br /><br />After going over the wall, I was able to run along the southern side of the mountains, to the back of the building with the clock tower. <br /><br />Just mouse over the wall until you see &quot;Weathered Bookcase&quot; and that's your goal.&nbsp; You can go out the same way you went in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Didn't take me that long to figure it out, ended up behind the wrong building but quickly figured out the right one. Do exactly what that first poster said, but getting out was a bit trickier, the wall i came over didn't allow me to go back over the same way. Just find the easiest path you can find and go over a wall, best bet would be the one that's broken and leads over to a ledge and yetis.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I couldn't get through the mountain tower pass, my human seems to be too tall, but...<br />I am a lvl 35 mage, i walked right through the main gate.&nbsp; The church with clock tower is straight ahead.&nbsp; I polymorphed the one ogre who was to close for me to get around without aggro'ing, went behind the clock tower building, got the book through the wall as described in the other posts, and that's it.&nbsp; I was able to get out of the ruins just running by everyone, with frost nova and blink making the escape even easier.&nbsp; Piece of cake, thanks for the posts all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The old book is in the clock tower house where Muckrake stands in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As a level 37 Dwarf.&nbsp; Followed the directions behind the Ruins of Alterac.&nbsp; I aggroed an Ogre (my fault :x ) but there is plenty of room behind the building with the clock tower to lose aggro.&nbsp; It does still work, the current patch is 1.10.<br /><br />If you don't see where the book case is here is a bit of help.&nbsp; The back of the building is shaped like <br />--<b>~</b>--|___|----- <br />Mouse over the part of the wall I marked as <b>~</b> and you're done.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Still works in 1.10.<br /><br />You do not have to homestone out btw. There are steps on some of the walls, like the one you came in. Just sprint, entangle, fear whatever ads you pull and hop over the wall. Very easy with Shadow Priest lvl 35.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Same strategy, using pet and feign death... Slip through the crack, pick a good line through the camp w/ few mobs. Get pet to take agro and rush to the building. If you die, res where you need to be. Grab the goods and go. I was able to make do with just a feign for when pet died. Same deal on the way back, although this time my pet actually lived. Run up the wall where you came in, jump out, you're all set.</div>

Wondered outside saw another named elite mob, pulled him inside the building and did the same thing. Need him for another quest (though I didn't know it at the time). I really don't understand the stigma attached to elite mobs anymore. Those 3 quests were cake.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a priest, at 34, I mind soothed my way into the city, carefully bypassing patrols until I got into the townhall. Originally, I had planned to mind control Muckrake but he's uncharmable, so I instead cast psychic scream, and he was feared long enough for me to grab the book. He came out just as I was leaving, and some adds came in while I ran out. Power shield worked, but things got dicy after a stun. With a desperate prayer, and another shield (discpline specced = 15 sec weakened soul) I managed to lose them and got away scott free!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Confirmed 11/20/06, still works to get it thru the wall. Just a clarification though, many people are saying &quot;back left&quot;, it's actually &quot;back right&quot;, if you are facing the schoolhouse. If you are behind the building facing the building, it's on left, just under the second window from the left. If you move your cursor over the wall, your cursor will turn into a gear (indictating you need to open/extract something). When it lights up yellow, you're golden. Get the book and get out.,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can soumeone confirm if it still works or did Blizzard fix it in the 2.0 update. I have been standing here for the last 2 hrs and I search all over the building walls and no gear icon :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>tried 7 times with 33 shaman. almost had it couple times if I had one more sec.<br />he will resist and ignor totems most of time. I drop earthbind, stoneclaw in the hallway. Then I pull him out into the hallway and drop fire nova totem. He will kill the fire nove first. Then you hope the earthbind will affect him. Run in and drop another earthbind just inside the door because it won't affect him thru the walls. auto loot. almost worked. <br /><br />so I got pissed, log my main, run in kill him, log back in and loot. this could have saved me 45mins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Run trough the camp. Try to avoid getting seen. Even if you get seen, keep running until you reach the point 38,46 (the back-left corner of the building with the bookcase). If you die here it's no big deal. Just run there and ressurect. From that point you can open the bookcase through the wall! Use Hearthstone back if you have it loaded.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I soloed this with my level 36 rogue, but the &quot;through the wall&quot; thing didn't work for me. They must have JUST fixed it. I spent like 20 minutes trying to get it to turn gold so I could grab it... wouldn't happen. I was still able to get it easily, though. I walked in stealthed, sapped the guy, grabbed it, and vanished. Worked nicely. Rogues are SWEET!<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 29th 2006 1:41pm by teamuffin</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 29th 2006 1:42pm by teamuffin</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got the book through the wall today, just like you guys said. Thanks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I soloed this with my level 37 druid, stealth in to the town hall, kill one elite level 37 patrolling ogre. Walk in, aggro the boss, root him around the corner, run in, loot, run to the golbin vendor on top and go under the arch. Home free and soloed!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Will confirm that wall trick still works after Patch 1.12, on 8/31/06. Coordinates are 38,46.<br /><br />Grabbed this one as 35 Pally, retribution spec</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Right, i can confirm the wall trick has been patched, so this is what i did with my 35 fury warr. Defensive stance, stoneform (dwarf racial) run in and tag muckrake, pull him out and hamstring him. RUN back in and you have JUST enough time to get the book before he reaches you. Worked for me. Good luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As of today getting the book through the wall still works, as a LvL 32 Rogue I stealth to the school house and around the side and got it. So sweet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just did it today. Works like a charm. Thanks all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just finished this as a 35 mage. I wanted to make it a little more clear. Walk behind the building, out side the building. You don't have to go inside. It works perfectly. 11/13/06</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I couldn't get the through-the-wall trick to work, so I dropped an Advanced Target Dummy to distract Muckrack, looted the book, waited for the dummy to blow, looted that (got Iron Strut, Bronze Framework, Heavy Leather x2, &amp; Fused Wiring), and hit Vanish. Stealthed out of the building, and got a guildie to Summon me to IF.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 17th 2006 at 10:18am PST by Lorielae</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got the book throught the wall as well today 8/4/06, if you are looking at the front of the building, it is to the back right. I had to get up on the little ledge to get it as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The &quot;through the wall&quot; trick was great - thanks for the tip! I was able to do this as a 34 mage with some careful walking around the elites.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>While you can't get it through the wall anymore, you can still solo this with whatever class tricks you have at hand. I'm a 37 shaman - i put a searing totem at the door and a stoneclaw just inside. He ran to the stoneclaw, then the searing, giving me just enough time to autoloot the book before he started beating on me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10n02</b></h3>The trick to use a glitch to take the book from the outside of the building doesn't work on Classic edition.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>irishlord</b></h3>32 mage. I was so excited to have 1 magic dust with me and show you all how its done. The magic dust failed. I frost nova and it worked. I sheeped over and over and one worked. I looted the case then died.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pauladin</b></h3>The Worn Leather Book is in a bookshelf at coordinates: .<br /><br />The room is <b>guarded</b> by <a href="/classic/npc=2421/muckrake">Muckrake</a>; he does not drop it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Codybold</b></h3>I read through a few of the 2006-2007 remarks on 7/7/2024. I tried to find the spot to reach for the book through the wall, but as some of the comments said, that glitch was fixed around 2007. As a rogue, I was relieved to learn that I could sap the big guy while in stealth, grab the book, and get away safely. As I was about to leave the elite area, I decided to try defeating an elite 36. I won, but it was tough. Fortunately, I had thistle tea to boost my energy and superior healing potion to regain health while poisoning him with each stab of my daggers. I have a few alts that will benefit from the comments, especially the hunter and priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jetpax</b></h3>I was not able to stun the mob and loot the book, but I used a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4391/compact-harvest-reaper-kit">Harvest Reaper</a> to attack the mob and take agro.<br /><br /> I looted the book and hearthed out with ease.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zeterai</b></h3>So it takes about five seconds to open the container on the current classic servers. If you die and resurrect on the bookshelf, and <b>immediately</b> cast some form of 4s+ crowd control, such as Hammer of Justice rank 2 in my case, and then start interacting again <b><i><u>immediately</u></i></b>, the AI has about a second of latency to figure out what the hell is going on, acquire you as a target, and then move the fat bastard over to you. It's just barely enough to loot it. Something like Repentance might very well be enough to get the job done if you're very quick about it.</div>
