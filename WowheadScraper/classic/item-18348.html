Once you speak to him, he will give you a quest to forge the Quel'Serrar, which ultimately requires you to attend a successful Onyxia raid.\n\nWhen I went to Onyxia to complete this quest I was not the main tank and was assigned a healer whose specific job was to keep me alive so that I would be able to place the blade (Unfired Ancient Blade) in the ground at the appropriate time.  So basically I did my part to contribute to the raid, and then in phase 3 at around 8-10% I ran up to where the MT was standing and dropped the blade next to him.  The raids DPS let up until she had breathed on it, and then we finished the kill.   Once she was dead I ran up and picked up the blade, then stabbed Onyxia with it.\n\nIn order to save time, I set my hearthstone to Feralas in advance, then ran into DM North, took a left and headed to the library.  Once I spoke to the NPC he awarded me with this sword.\n\nFor some people it may be difficult to get this quest completed if your guild is not currently farming her or even attempting her at all. My advice then is to check with some guilds on your server to see if you can take up a spot at their next raid to complete the quest, and perhaps even offer them a little bit of gold as well.  I have had this sword for a long time now and absolutely love it.\n\nI wish everyone who plans on getting this sword the best of luck, and hope this post provides a little bit of insight as to what to expect.","date":"2006-09-16T16:39:11-05:00","rating":273,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Good post but they come from Dusty Tomes (books) not Dusty Tombs. :D Only off by one letter but that one letter makes a big difference.","creationdate":"2006-10-14T15:54:23-05:00","id":285622,"rating":-5,"commentid":538,"dataTree":1,"roles":256,"username":"thomasjs","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"He\/she did say tomes, I don't see how he said tombs.","creationdate":"2006-12-17T05:45:16-06:00","id":286344,"rating":-5,"commentid":538,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Thurissan","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":1,"id":3461,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"knofle","body":"This sword is the number one tanking sword quite far in the game.

That means you would need to run an average of 20x ZG's to see it drop (and then compete with your other guild members to get it).\n\nGive me Quel'Serrar anyday!","date":"2006-12-18T20:19:01-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"id":3064549,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"So this book drops in Dire Maul but requires the defeat of Onxyia?","date":"2005-03-30T02:46:13-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SpynxRunner","importedSubject":"Question"},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":3064550,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"[url=http:\/\/faerhan.no-ip.com\/stuff\/kroni\/1.jpg]http:\/\/faerhan.no-ip.com\/stuff\/kroni\/1.jpg[\/url]\n[url=http:\/\/faerhan.no-ip.com\/stuff\/kroni\/2.jpg]http:\/\/faerhan.no-ip.com\/stuff\/kroni\/2.jpg[\/url]\nthe new glow sucks, i liked the violet one much more ;)","date":"2005-06-12T20:30:06-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"CodexGermania","importedSubject":"Troll"},{"commentv2":1,"number":14,"id":3064551,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I Really want to buy the the foror to get this sword, been farming it for weeks with no luck.

That means by game design it's for Paladins AND Warriors. After that it comes down to a few things. Also, since the book itself doesn't bind and is a world drop, and many can be found for sale on the Auction House, it's not harming any warrior's chance to tank by a paladin having this. Simply put, forge all you want, they'll make more.\n\nPaladins carrying and using this? Not a bad thing, every melee class needs some kind of good weapon and Quel'Serrar is a good 1H sword. It allows us to solo and PvP quite nicely. I find other items are better for instances, but then again I'm a full bore healing paladin. I've since given up the dream that paladins can solo tank anything much bigger than Scholo or Stratholme, and they have special skills to help there. So will I use this sword when I'm in an instance? Only when I want to irritate our fury warrior, but that's just some good fun. I tend to rely on my Hammer of the Grand Crusader with +22 intellect enchanted on it, and sit back and heal and buff. It's what we're best at.\n\nWarriors, of course, love this toy. It's big, it's mean looking, it's also a badge of honor. Warriors with it can show the world they were in a group that killed Onyxia, oh and that they were fortunate enough to either find the book or the money to buy it. But that holds true for paladins as well.\n\nAs for the last part? Paladins tanking? They can off-tank. It's always been my opinion that a paladin's main job as an off tank is to sweep up stray aggro, throw a consecrate on the unattended mobs that may ag on your healers, sweep up the secondary targets until the real tank can come by, pick him up, and hold him still while your DPSers burn him down.\n\nOh... and Blessing of Kings? Best. Buff. Period.\n\nMy build's 31\/20\/0 Holy and Protection, and I'm never sitting in IF long waiting for folks to have me along to buff, heal, and save the squishies.","date":"2006-08-24T18:39:11-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Hear hear.","creationdate":"2006-08-25T03:33:29-05:00","id":1279110,"rating":0,"commentid":3064598,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Nergel","importedSubject":"Paladins with The High Blade"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ArgentPaladin","importedSubject":"Paladins with The High Blade"},{"commentv2":1,"number":60,"id":3064599,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"just got the book and killing onyxia tonight on shattered hand alliance and getting this bad boy.  two members of DnT on our server have it, i'll be the third.\n\nbest tank weapon in the game by far.  #$%^, maybe i'll even pvp w\/ a shield now?","date":"2005-03-26T20:49:35-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"pgjensen","importedSubject":"WOOT"},{"commentv2":1,"number":61,"id":3064600,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Had the book drop for me on Saturday the 26th.

Rogues use their abilities to do damage to the enemy while the warrior uses his Rage abilities to make sure that the aggro is kept squarely on him, which allows him to do more damage than the Rogue, otherwise the Rogue would pick up aggro everytime his negative shouts fall off. Paladins are there to keep the warrior alive while doing damage to the enemy. Feral druids are unique in the aspect that they can do damage and heal themselves while the other classes cannot. However, they cannot do as much damage or as much healing (this comes from the fact that druids can reach 60 completely by soloing and possibly never needing a group, similar to a Warlock) as a non-split class (warrior, mage, priest, rogue - in case you never played it, those are the four core classes in old-school D&D) the split classes (Warlock, Paladin, Hunter, Shaman) are intended to be based between one or the other. Paladin and Hunter are tanks first and casters second. Shaman and Warlock are casters primarily, with added effects from the Warlock's pet and the Shaman's damage. So if you were going to build a list it would look like this:\n\nMain line:\nWarrior, Rogue, Warlock pet (Voidwalker)\nSupport main line:\nWarlock pet (Succubus), Hunter and pet, Paladin\nRear line:\nShaman, Priest, Mage, Warlock and Imp, if for some ungodly reason you use this pet. (I have a warlock, and yes, the Imp is in the Special Olympics with a gold medal. Get a V\/W or a Succ.)\n\nThat is the basis for how the classes are supposed to be played as \"true\" to their class. \n\nThis is not counting all of the variables present,  this is just where the belong according to damage and armor class and what skills they use. Not intended to pigeonhole the classes (except mage, priest and warlock - no offense, just that you're casters and damage taking isn't exactly something you are masters at.)\n\nNOTE: This list is compiled based on the armor and damage ratings primarily and then skills and then secondary abilities (pets etc.). The basis DOES NOT take into account damage and protection that comes from items. This list is not intended to cure or diagnose any symptoms. Never pet a burning dog. Do not swim for at least an hour after reading. May cause feelings of having your face rocked.

Its a beautiful weapon. I had to log off soon after so I didn't get a chance to use it. So I have a few questions. \n\nHow often does the proc go off?\nWhat enchant should I go with? (I'm told 15 agi.)\n\nPallies - I'm a Horde Prot Tank. So, I can't give much of an opinion of the validity of your desire for this sword. But from what a few alliance friends who play Pallies tell me, Pallies get no love with weaponry and get shafted into specs they don't really want to play. My only opinion is that since the book states that the quest chain for the QS is multi-class Pallies shouldn't be disallowed to roll on the book or be mocked for having this sword. In fact I'd imagine that this sword would look pretty sweet with a full Lawbringer set and a Zulian Defender. So pallies, if you happen to be hitting Dire Maul and this book drops, try for a chance at it. I know I'm no help at all to you but I think that everyone should have a fair chance at it.\n\nAquisition - I was lucky enuf to recieve the book as a gift from my former guild leader who had disbanded the guild and was clearing out the banks for ppl who actively gave could get something back. I immediately flew to Feralas and snuck into the DM library through the North entrance. Got my unfired blade. Unfortunately the day I was scheduled to ge tmy QS I got scheduled to work. SO my girlfriend ran the run for me. Got the treated blade and I turned it in as soon as I could get logged on. She said the fight was hectic and she was nervous (Onyxia virgin, lol). I'm happy now. I was next in line for a Bloodlord's Defender when\/if it dropped, but I won't be needing it now. So its getting passed on to the other warriors now. I'll still be keeping my Annihilator axe though.

Fact of the matter is, Pallies are meant to back up the tank. I don't pretend to be a healer, or dpser.

I am a prot pally and i can tank through any 5\/10\/20 man and certain things in MC all with lvl 55-60 blues on...\n\nThe question is not whether a warrior can hold agro better. Its what types of tanking can each do better. Paladins tanks are built for AoE tanking...thats hold the agro of multiple, low-dmg targets. Warriors can in no way come even close in this department. Sure they may have a few makeshift AoE taunts, but they cannot sustain this. The only thing at this point holding paladins back is the fact that mana doesnt regen like rage...so if it is a long fight they will lose agro if they dont have pots.\n\nThis problem will be solved in the expansion. So paladins and warriors will both tank well in BC. But just in different situations. Even if a paladins can tank 1 mob fine, a warrior can do it better. That is that.\n\n\n[i][small]Edited, Nov 25th 2006  8:40pm by Glenan[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-11-26T02:34:43-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Glenan","importedSubject":"Its not a competition..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":175,"id":3064714,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"For you all who keep asking about the proc on Quel...it's actually quite often...my crit line mod shows it procing about 19%.

Quel'Serrar is obviously a tank weapon. However, the stats are rather underwhelming. It's not too slow, but not very fast either. The stamina is nice, but the proc is nothing to write home about. At a hypothetical proc rate of 2 procs per minute, it only evens out to 4 defense and 100 armor flat. That's nothing to write home about, dare I say, it's completely negligible.\n\nCompare that to the [item=18805]. A bit less stamina, about the same DPS but faster, +20AP and 1% Crit. The more threat you do, the more DPS can be done, the faster the boss dies, and the less healing you need. It doesn't matter if your healers have to heal you a little bit more, as long as the boss dies before they go oom.\n\nAgain, if you can get it easily through whatever means, it's a good weapon.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Simulator</b></h3>Quel'Serrar is the final quest reward from a questline that begins with &lt;Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying&gt;, an item that can be rarely found in Dire Maul inside of Dusty Tomes and dropped from the various bosses.<br /><br />I have been fortunate enough to personally loot this book (twice) and complete the questline, therefore I'll share a few of comments of what I experienced during my trials for future Warriors &amp; Paladins that may be preparing to do the quest line for themselves.<br /><br />Once you right click on the book and accept the quest, head to the DM library and speak to one of the NPC's (Lorekeeper Lydros) there. Once you speak to him, he will give you a quest to forge the Quel'Serrar, which ultimately requires you to attend a successful Onyxia raid.<br /><br />When I went to Onyxia to complete this quest I was not the main tank and was assigned a healer whose specific job was to keep me alive so that I would be able to place the blade (Unfired Ancient Blade) in the ground at the appropriate time. So basically I did my part to contribute to the raid, and then in phase 3 at around 8-10% I ran up to where the MT was standing and dropped the blade next to him. The raids DPS let up until she had breathed on it, and then we finished the kill. Once she was dead I ran up and picked up the blade, then stabbed Onyxia with it.<br /><br />In order to save time, I set my hearthstone to Feralas in advance, then ran into DM North, took a left and headed to the library. Once I spoke to the NPC he awarded me with this sword.<br /><br />For some people it may be difficult to get this quest completed if your guild is not currently farming her or even attempting her at all. My advice then is to check with some guilds on your server to see if you can take up a spot at their next raid to complete the quest, and perhaps even offer them a little bit of gold as well. I have had this sword for a long time now and absolutely love it.<br /><br />I wish everyone who plans on getting this sword the best of luck, and hope this post provides a little bit of insight as to what to expect.</div>

You may like the Bloodlord's Defender (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19867">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19867</a>) more, because of it's &quot;on equip&quot;-stats, but as far as I have experienced, Quel'Serrar's proc is up almost all of the time.<br /><br />13 defense and 300 armor is good stuff.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4025</b></h3>Quel'Serrar is slightly superior to Bloodlord's Defender if you are prepared to accept that it's defensive properties are less consistent.<br /><br />My tests showed the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; Proc Rate was 1.5 to 2ppm.<br /><br />For comparison it's generally accepted that the Crusader Enchant is 1ppm. <br />My QS had the Crusader Enchant and I performed testing with over 2000 attacks recording the procs of each.<br /><br />Is the Sword worth the effort?<br /><br />I did close to 200 runs to Dire Maul hoping to find this book and never did. What I did was save most of the money I made ON those runs ready to buy it should it appear on the AH. Eventually it did and I paid a fortune for it and would say it's not worth that time/money if you Raiding Zul'Gurub or Blackwing Lair.<br /><br />Then again this weapon is somewhat &quot;Iconic&quot; which some like me can't put a price on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7476</b></h3>I have this on my fury warrior with a Ancient Hakkari Manslayer as my off hand. Love the proc rate on both of these. loooove the dps as well :]</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7543</b></h3>If you happen to get Foror's Compendium from just running DM for fun sometime, just sell it and save the cash for your flying mount. Otherwise, don't bother buying it. If you're in a raiding guild, several swords, including Bloodlord's Defender, and especially Maladath, are just as good or better than QS. <br /><br />The expansion is out in less than 6 weeks, and it appears that quest rewards from the low 60s are comparable or better to this sword.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19335">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19335</a> Is very nice due the new talents in patch 2.0 You don't need a very fast tanking weapon, if you are protection spec. QS Would still be better thats true, but if your guild killed Razorgore and you can't get bloodlord's defender, and don't want to farm a year to get QS, then Spineshatter is pretty nice.<br /><br />---EDIT</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>raysofvb</b></h3>One of the best Tanking weapons in the game. If you happen to find the book for cheap or happen to find it in Dire Maul..You'll be a happy Tank. By the way this weapon should go to a warrior.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8456</b></h3>It occupies one buff slot, so....i prefer Bloodlord's Defender.<br />Besides, Bloodlord's Defender is easier to get.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8271</b></h3>This is a great tanking wepon for a lvl 60 guild that just started MC, ZG, or Ony. The nice dps and rage gain is very good. Even though Paladin's can use it it still a good tanking wepon to both classes. Yes Paladins can tank..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9718</b></h3>Great weapon for tanking for warriors. Although I don't believe it is the BEST in the game so far. There are a few weapons supierior to this but they are quite difficult to obtain. Once the book(Foror's Compendium of Dragonslaying) is acquired, you will need to turn it in located in the Dire Maul library. After that you should get a quest to head to Onyxia's Lair and at a low percentage of life, allow her to breathe on the weapon and then stab her with your heated blade, you will then have to turn in the quest for your Quel' Serrar.<br />Hope I was of help to you all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thurissan</b></h3>If anyone can... please give me some advice on how to obtain these easier if possible than just running Dire Maul over 300 times...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>redaxe</b></h3>If you are intent on getting this weapon then I recommend you keep a close eye on your local AH for the Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying. Some bargains are bound to appear now that TBC is approaching.<br /><br />I would not recommend farming for this since it has a very low drop rate.<br /><br />I purchased this book a couple of months back and I have never regretted it. True, you may need your gold for your flying mount in TBC but I am confident that gold will be a lot easier to come by when you get into the expansion.<br /><br />Bloodlord's Defender is a great weapon as well, but it's drop rate is around 4-5%. That means you would need to run an average of 20x ZG's to see it drop (and then compete with your other guild members to get it).<br /><br />Give me Quel'Serrar anyday!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So this book drops in Dire Maul but requires the defeat of Onxyia?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I Really want to buy the the foror to get this sword, been farming it for weeks with no luck. If you have one and want to sell then PST me in game. My name is Evere on dragonmaw horde.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone who thinks Quel'Serrar is a crappy wpn obviously isnt a tank. If you are a tank and refuse to use this over the Bloodlord's Defender, you should take a look at MTs from guilds that are raiding MC, BWL, and AQ40. Just about all of them wield and swear by it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>quel is still a great tanking sword. The PvP weapons are for pvp, this thing is ment for tanks, not damage dealers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>for one of the (if not the ONLY) end-game tank weapons, this weapon is remarkably un-remarkable...<br /><br />52.5 dps? awesome, great speed/dmg~<br />+12 stamina? hm, sure... there are other weapons with 10/11, but 12 is good too<br />proc? all i can say is... unless this proc goes off every 5 hits, it is pretty weak sauce for such high end gear, it would truly be &quot;epic&quot; if the 20 defense and 300 armor were permanent... <br /><br />as it is, the new 1h mace from dire maul (120 armor, 11sta, 41ish dps) is just 10 dps shy of this puppy, and stattly awesomer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i would sell my soul for that sword. 52.5 dps on a one hand, its fast, and its got higher damage than my current weapon? thanks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Geez. This is so amazing im lost for words........<br /><br />I dont think anyone has beaten onyxia in silvermoon yet, but hey, theres a first time for everything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To get the Qeul'Serrar:<br /><br />First, by running Dire Maul over and over, there's a chance a boss will drop a book: <a href="/classic/item=18401/nostros-compendium-of-dragon-slaying">Nostro's Compendium of Dragon Slaying</a> you can buy the book off someone who found it, though you'll be looking at paying over 1000 gold for it. It is not Bind on Pickup.<br /><br />Open the book and take the quest. You then take the book to the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, or Library in DM North. You can sneak in there as a level 60, it's that doorway in the pit with all the dogs and Ogres sitting by the fire.<br /><br />You speak to an elf there by a bookshelf. He gives you <a href="/classic/item=18489/unfired-ancient-blade">Unfired Ancient Blade</a> now have the quest: <a href="/classic/quest=7509/the-forging-of-quelserrar">The Forging of Quel'Serrar</a> you have to take the blade with you in an Onyxia raid. When she hits &quot;stage 3&quot;, thats when she is breathing fire, you have to place the blade in front of her. Run back to your position and continue fighting. When she breathes on it, you have 20-25 minutes to kill Onyxia or you will fail the quest. Once she is dead, you pick the fired blade up and stab it into Onyxia's corpse to cool it with her blood. You now have a Quel'Serrar :)</div>

You have to get to stage three and plant the sword so she breathes fire onto it to heat it up but you should plant late into the battle since you ony have like under 30 min. Then you kill her and pick up the hot sword and stick it into her so so you cool it down with her blood. Now this is the part where im confused do you roll on it or do you have to go take the sword back to the elven dude and then get it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A truely fine piece of equipment. My guild assisted me in forging this last Friday and it is truely as great as the stats might suggest. Read the guide at the bottom it is quite accurate as to what needs to be done to obtain this weapon. With the exception of the legendary werapons this in my opinion is the best tank sword in the game cuurently.<br /><br />A couple of things...<br /><br />1. The five minute thing is true so be quick about picking it up, if your in Phase three when you plant it the 20 minutes shouldnt be an issue.<br /><br />2. She fears alot in phase three so see if you can get a dwarf priest to throw fear ward on you so that you are not interupted when you attempt to pick it up. Like previously stated, its instant to put it down but timed to pick it up.</div>

PERIOD&lt; THEY ARE MADE FOR BACKUP HEALS AND THE BUFFS&gt; <br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />60 dwarf warrior, kalecgos</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The debate as to who the weapon is for is mostly moot, the book says paladins and warriors. That means by game design it's for Paladins AND Warriors. After that it comes down to a few things. Also, since the book itself doesn't bind and is a world drop, and many can be found for sale on the Auction House, it's not harming any warrior's chance to tank by a paladin having this. Simply put, forge all you want, they'll make more.<br /><br />Paladins carrying and using this? Not a bad thing, every melee class needs some kind of good weapon and Quel'Serrar is a good 1H sword. It allows us to solo and PvP quite nicely. I find other items are better for instances, but then again I'm a full bore healing paladin. I've since given up the dream that paladins can solo tank anything much bigger than Scholo or Stratholme, and they have special skills to help there. So will I use this sword when I'm in an instance? Only when I want to irritate our fury warrior, but that's just some good fun. I tend to rely on my Hammer of the Grand Crusader with +22 intellect enchanted on it, and sit back and heal and buff. It's what we're best at.<br /><br />Warriors, of course, love this toy. It's big, it's mean looking, it's also a badge of honor. Warriors with it can show the world they were in a group that killed Onyxia, oh and that they were fortunate enough to either find the book or the money to buy it. But that holds true for paladins as well.<br /><br />As for the last part? Paladins tanking? They can off-tank. It's always been my opinion that a paladin's main job as an off tank is to sweep up stray aggro, throw a consecrate on the unattended mobs that may ag on your healers, sweep up the secondary targets until the real tank can come by, pick him up, and hold him still while your DPSers burn him down.<br /><br />Oh... and Blessing of Kings? Best. Buff. Period.<br /><br />My build's 31/20/0 Holy and Protection, and I'm never sitting in IF long waiting for folks to have me along to buff, heal, and save the squishies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The poor guy just told his opinion and you call him an idiot mate. There is definitely nothing about this blade worthy to call other PPL idiots. If he is wanting this sword so badly I say OK. I'm a paladin too and used to command groups so I know what happens when PPL want something badly (breakup whorstcase scenario). A MT can handle aggro with any weapon and this one doesn't aggro well. Oh and YEA, since when does a <br /><br />Considering what's the current paladin status in this game, doesn't show any mercy on weapon drops. I have seen a paladin with full tier1 set weilding a 1h green sword lvl 57 ...of the boar! This isn't about who gets the weapon. It's about the group, if they are friends or only stupid hardcores...<br /><br />I personaly got my Sul'thraze a while back and it's still more worthy as most lvl 60 2H's. I could have got another weapon and HELL YEA I would like a lot of those.<br /><br />Paladin as a tank... Yes it's possible and it also works on most undeads and demons but a paladins role is a little different. It's a paladin which keeps a good party alive with blesings and auras, not to mention a suicide DI action in WIPE situations, while priests offer a confortable solution for MT's and OT's. Paladin's life isn't easy and noone offers something in compensation...<br /><br />HOUWGNH</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dont understand why people are getting mad at Pallies for walking around with this blade. If a pally wants to cough up 400-2500 G for the book at AH then whats the problem? The book did said it was for warriors and PALADINS only.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Paladins can offtank acceptably .. but will never match the threat generation of a warrior .. and your givin plate so you can run in and judge stuff in raids without dying. And so you can heal where a priest might be risky.<br /><br />however saying that paladins shouldnt be allowed to roll on this is foolish its a nice mainhander for them .. or for a tank .. and tbh guys people who really want to get this sword, warriors especially will probably buy the damn book of someone friendly who wont charge them 2000 damn gold for it (got mine for 500).<br /><br />Just dont take the book of someone whose got a decent chance of visiting onyxia and claiming his sword soon .. thats kinda sucky the amount of lv 55 warrs/paladins with 2000 baught gold and an untreated ancient bade that give up cos they suck when theres good warrs/paladins out there that need this sword is a travesty lol.</div>

And if you do get it needs to proc at least every 3-5 swings to make it realy epic. I am not saying i would not take cause good god it has more dps then my old destiny, but as lvl 60 warrior on windrunner we have yet to find the book or rune blade and have just started fight Onyxia. And i first day at it we spent 6 hours and each time got better but still only managed to get her to 65%. <br />so getting that sword will be a while for us :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I don't know about holding aggro (though Righteous Fury does help), but thanks to its low speed, it combines very well with a Judged Seal of Light, followed with a Seal of the Crusader (or a nuking Seal if the pally needs to hold aggro). +55 hp nearly every hit, makes the hp go down much slower :-j</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've never played a pally so feel free to flame away. IMO if a pally has a chance to roll on the book, ROLL ON IT. I hate how people come to these forums and make them look like this is Thottbot. My friend (prot tank) just got this last night and it's a sexy ass sword, cant wait to see it in action. <br /><br />Pally's CAN tank, but for how long? they have a mana pool. Warriors do not.<br />Same thing for druids (off topic) in bear form. they make good tanks, generate hella hate but they're missing one thing. Parry (unless this changed recently).<br /><br />Warriors are given the skillset to tank/dps. Pally's are given the skills to tank/heal (for a finite amount of time). To each their own imo. If you're a pally and you can tank with your mix of oddball armor pieces(tier sets are geared for heals) then by all means tank till u run outta mana, bubble, let the warriors take over, pot and start healin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Now before ZG was up this was the best tankingweapon in game, though now with ZG it aint.<br /><br />This weapon; <a href="/classic/item=19867/bloodlords-defender">Bloodlord's Defender</a> aswell, or even better since it has stable stats. You don´t need to rely on a proc.<br /><br />If we count it this way;<br />You´re in a fight with a Molten Giant and if we say that the fight goes on for 60 seconds. If you have Quel'Serrar and it procs one time during these 60 seconds you will have 13 defense and 300 armor. So we´re down to 50 seconds fight without any stats at all, except stamina.<br /><br />Now Broodlord's Defender on the other hand has 80 armor, 15 stamina and Defense +4 all the time. So instead of having alot of defense and armor during 10 seconds you´ll have all these stats during the whole fight. Which is worth more imo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok, if in the new expansion paladins are getting a taunt...who cares, warriors are still the tanking class in the game. If they make paladins better than warriors at tanking i will quit, thats what happened to eq2. warriors have been and should always be the FIRST choice for tank. as far as this weapon goes? I just want it to say i have it, hakar dropped a sword for me =), so i'm happy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Warriors and pallies may be equal in tanking BEFORE such instances as ZG, AQ, MC, BWL, and Naxx. I say this because in instances like UBRS, LBRS, DM, Strat etc. the warriors arent really taking heavy amounts of damage, more damage = more rage, more rage = more threat producing moves, more threat producing moves = better tank. The mobs and bosses hit tons harder in MC, BWL, blah blah etc. which would suit a warrior much better because of the generation of rage. A pally however cant change the amount of aggro he produces unless he changes upgrades his gear, DPS, mana pool, health, etc. So, in my opinion pallies can tank fine in the less important instances, but once you start doing more meaningful things, a warrior should be more suited for holding aggro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Haha, whoever posts a &quot;Paladin's can't tank&quot; message has never had a paladin for a tank, my guild has the only paladin tank i have ever seen, last week in shattered halls 4 of our 5 man group wiped after getting Kargath down to 40 someodd percent, and our paladin tanked him for 5 minutes while we just sat there watching, then we decided we should go give him a hand, so she tanked Kargath for about 7-8 minutes all by herself, so give paladin tanks a chance, as far as i am concerned, they have every right to be standing among guilds as tanks as warriors do, and as far as weapons go, its not about the base damage, heck, your next weapon could have 60-70 more max damage than this but its not quite up to snuff if its dps is lower or its speed is slower<br /><br /><i>Edited, May 16th 2007 12:41pm by Artixkriegor</i></div>

I've had the effect to proc 3 times in a row, and then frequent enough after that where the buff never really goes out, it just keeps refreshing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Warriors take aggro off of everybody, but most importantly Rogues and caster-classes. Rogues use their abilities to do damage to the enemy while the warrior uses his Rage abilities to make sure that the aggro is kept squarely on him, which allows him to do more damage than the Rogue, otherwise the Rogue would pick up aggro everytime his negative shouts fall off. Paladins are there to keep the warrior alive while doing damage to the enemy. Feral druids are unique in the aspect that they can do damage and heal themselves while the other classes cannot. However, they cannot do as much damage or as much healing (this comes from the fact that druids can reach 60 completely by soloing and possibly never needing a group, similar to a Warlock) as a non-split class (warrior, mage, priest, rogue - in case you never played it, those are the four core classes in old-school D&amp;D) the split classes (Warlock, Paladin, Hunter, Shaman) are intended to be based between one or the other. Paladin and Hunter are tanks first and casters second. Shaman and Warlock are casters primarily, with added effects from the Warlock's pet and the Shaman's damage. So if you were going to build a list it would look like this:<br /><br />Main line:<br />Warrior, Rogue, Warlock pet (Voidwalker)<br />Support main line:<br />Warlock pet (Succubus), Hunter and pet, Paladin<br />Rear line:<br />Shaman, Priest, Mage, Warlock and Imp, if for some ungodly reason you use this pet. (I have a warlock, and yes, the Imp is in the Special Olympics with a gold medal. Get a V/W or a Succ.)<br /><br />That is the basis for how the classes are supposed to be played as &quot;true&quot; to their class. <br /><br />This is not counting all of the variables present, this is just where the belong according to damage and armor class and what skills they use. Not intended to pigeonhole the classes (except mage, priest and warlock - no offense, just that you're casters and damage taking isn't exactly something you are masters at.)<br /><br />NOTE: This list is compiled based on the armor and damage ratings primarily and then skills and then secondary abilities (pets etc.). The basis DOES NOT take into account damage and protection that comes from items. This list is not intended to cure or diagnose any symptoms. Never pet a burning dog. Do not swim for at least an hour after reading. May cause feelings of having your face rocked. (I owe seanbaby a quarter for that line)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just got mine roughly an hour ago. Its a beautiful weapon. I had to log off soon after so I didn't get a chance to use it. So I have a few questions. <br /><br />How often does the proc go off?<br />What enchant should I go with? (I'm told 15 agi.)<br /><br />Pallies - I'm a Horde Prot Tank. So, I can't give much of an opinion of the validity of your desire for this sword. But from what a few alliance friends who play Pallies tell me, Pallies get no love with weaponry and get shafted into specs they don't really want to play. My only opinion is that since the book states that the quest chain for the QS is multi-class Pallies shouldn't be disallowed to roll on the book or be mocked for having this sword. In fact I'd imagine that this sword would look pretty sweet with a full Lawbringer set and a Zulian Defender. So pallies, if you happen to be hitting Dire Maul and this book drops, try for a chance at it. I know I'm no help at all to you but I think that everyone should have a fair chance at it.<br /><br />Aquisition - I was lucky enuf to recieve the book as a gift from my former guild leader who had disbanded the guild and was clearing out the banks for ppl who actively gave could get something back. I immediately flew to Feralas and snuck into the DM library through the North entrance. Got my unfired blade. Unfortunately the day I was scheduled to ge tmy QS I got scheduled to work. SO my girlfriend ran the run for me. Got the treated blade and I turned it in as soon as I could get logged on. She said the fight was hectic and she was nervous (Onyxia virgin, lol). I'm happy now. I was next in line for a Bloodlord's Defender when/if it dropped, but I won't be needing it now. So its getting passed on to the other warriors now. I'll still be keeping my Annihilator axe though. Never know when my weapon might break and its always good to have a backup plan.<br /><br />Vesare - 60 Troll Prot Warrior - Paper Street Soap Co. - Vek'nilash server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Once you throw sword down, you have 5 minutes to get it heated and pick back up. I'd say around 10% or below throw the sword down. I'm the guild's MT and tried this, I ended up dying by whelps at 1% and the remaining 4 or 5 killed her and then died by the whelps. At the time i rezzed the sword vanished =(. So have to wait until instance resets to try again. You need to abandon quest and go back to DM library and talk to npc to restart quest. You can keep abandoning quest and getting new unheated blade as many times as needed until you get the job done.<br /><br />Omni<br />Gilneas Realm<br />LOH FTW!<br /><br />Edited, Wed Dec 14 15:49:40 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>When the book drops, Warriors get priority on this, here's why...<br /><br />Seeing as this lasts a Prot warrior up to NAXX, and all their T1+ gear is for tanking, and all paladin T1+ gear is for healing...wonder who would benefit from this sword the most...<br /><br />Do paladins tank in endgame raids? No, or very little. Specially when there's warriors there that can do it.<br /><br />And if you think warriors are the biggest loot &amp;*!@#s, that's because they can't throw up a nice little bubble and heal themselves. Warriors are #1 on gear dependency.<br /><br />I think the only reason it says &quot;Paladin&quot; on it is because Blizzard wanted to make it that much harder for a warrior to get it, cause we know how much Blizzard likes warriors. &gt;_&lt;<br /><br />Know your class. Paladins make decent off-tanks.<br /><br />In Burning Crusade this could change though, paladins might actually be able to MT as well as a warrior, but..that remains to be seen.<br /><br />All the above is concerning raiding, MC and above. Paladins can tank fine in 5-10 mans if they have what it takes. And they don't need Quel'Serrar to do it.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 29th 2006 5:09am by patrickwolf</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Trying to say a pally tank is better than a warrior one on single targets is just stupid. I am a prot pally and i can tank through any 5/10/20 man and certain things in MC all with lvl 55-60 blues on...<br /><br />The question is not whether a warrior can hold agro better. Its what types of tanking can each do better. Paladins tanks are built for AoE tanking...thats hold the agro of multiple, low-dmg targets. Warriors can in no way come even close in this department. Sure they may have a few makeshift AoE taunts, but they cannot sustain this. The only thing at this point holding paladins back is the fact that mana doesnt regen like rage...so if it is a long fight they will lose agro if they dont have pots.<br /><br />This problem will be solved in the expansion. So paladins and warriors will both tank well in BC. But just in different situations. Even if a paladins can tank 1 mob fine, a warrior can do it better. That is that.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Nov 25th 2006 8:40pm by Glenan</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For you all who keep asking about the proc on Quel...it's actually quite often...my crit line mod shows it procing about 19%. As to where you get it...you have to get Foror's Compendium of Dragonslaying out of DM to get the quest then you have to do an Onyxia run so she can breath on it and you can stab her corpse with it..then return to DM and you get it.<br /><br />The noob who posted that it dropped off Hakkar is either smoking crack or has never actually played WoW and is simply going off of what his friends have told him.<br /><br />I've had it about 8 months and I've used it for both warrior builds..tanking and DPS. Some may laugh but I am usually around #5 on the damage meters only outdamaged by superiorly geared rogues and mages. The dmg and speed make it very useful to fury warrs, but priority on this one should go to warrior tanks. <br /><br />BTW...who the hell cares if pallies have the ability to tank...their job is simple...pull bosses...heal...bubble...hearth. And what does their tanking *snicker* have to do with the sword?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Beyondfubar</b></h3>Blizzard was maddeningly inconsistent when it came to tanking items and abilities. Paladins may do the quest for the most iconic of early vanilla's tanking weapons, but clearly don't need a taunt. Druids do get a taunt, but while that bear mob just parried your attack it makes no sense for bear form druid to do so, let's not even discuss the lack of druids and casters seeing a benefit from a new weapon tangibly as physical damage classes do.<br /><br />Still with the phase rollout timeframes being something of a mystery, this may be the pinnacle of warrior tanking until phase 2 or later depending on how much you're willing to work. ZG is the first somewhat easy side grade as others have stated, and for those of us not really willing to put in the 100% focus time needed for a 40 man MT spot that's where I'd start.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NFoRc3R</b></h3>If anyone says they want it for the stats they are lying.<br />Tanks want it for a simple reason, it looks cool, it's epic and also hard to obtain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Muffpotter</b></h3>As tasty as this weapon looks, I do not believe it's worth the effort/money unless:<br /><br />a) You have a guild sponsoring you.<br />b) You have a ton of cash, or the time, patience and self-loathing to farm it yourself<br />c) You are human.<br />d) Your rogues get salty AF if you try to yoink their daggers.<br /><br />Let's break it down. Quel'Serrar is obviously a tank weapon. However, the stats are rather underwhelming. It's not too slow, but not very fast either. The stamina is nice, but the proc is nothing to write home about. At a hypothetical proc rate of 2 procs per minute, it only evens out to 4 defense and 100 armor flat. That's nothing to write home about, dare I say, it's completely negligible.<br /><br />Compare that to the <a href="/classic/item=18805/core-hound-tooth">Core Hound Tooth</a>. A bit less stamina, about the same DPS but faster, +20AP and 1% Crit. The more threat you do, the more DPS can be done, the faster the boss dies, and the less healing you need. It doesn't matter if your healers have to heal you a little bit more, as long as the boss dies before they go oom.<br /><br />Again, if you can get it easily through whatever means, it's a good weapon. But there are great (if not better) alternatives in MC.</div>
