There is a higher drop rate form the EPL skeletons, but they are quite a bit more difficult to down, and slow down your kill rate considerably unless you are in epic gear.  If you are in epics though I'd farm Plaguewood, out in front of Stratholme, or around the other Zigaruts in EPL.  Those will yield better fragments with chances of Crypt Fiend parts as well.  All-in-all the crypt fiend parts and bone fragments are definitely the most pain in the butt to farm.","date":"2006-09-20T09:37:39-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SofaKingCool","importedSubject":"Drops"},{"commentv2":1,"number":24,"id":3092010,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":".\n\n[i][small]Edited, Jul 31st  2006 at  3:03am EDT by mooksap[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-07-31T03:18:17-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"mooksap","importedSubject":"money"},{"commentv2":1,"number":25,"id":3092011,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Picked up 7 greens, a blue, traveler's backpack, 6g in vendor trash, 200 runecloth and about 90 bone fragments in 2 hours farming in felstone field as a 60 rogue for my shaman. \n\nThe sorcerer's seem to have the highest drop rate- nearing 40%, but the other skeletal mobs were all also at 30% or above.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its only 10 rep for 2nd turn in</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They dont drop off any undead. In epl or wpl u have to look at the undeads.. only the skeletel monsters drop them, seems like common sense really</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Farmed them in Andorhal, works pretty well for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Whilst trying to get one more scourgestone to cash in 10 on the undead near Light's hope I got 8 of them and only 2 Invader's scourgestones from the Dread Weavers and Forsaken Champions. Basically kill anything that looks like its made from bones, the drop rate isn't too bad, I made it to be about 30-40% from my kills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have finded only one good spot to farm this items, the first field of undead in western plague, where i can do a bit of AOE, good droprate and very fast respawn.... but in my server it's camped 24/7 by farmer... and i see every day people selling many stack of 300 fragments....<br /><br />i have tryed stratholme unded as well but i must go with a group and share the loot with 4 other ppl...<br />also tryed andorhal, EPL, i can't find a good place...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lately, the drop rate for me has been horrid. The first batch or two of 30 I got, pre-level-60, was pretty ast. Now, it seems to be about a 5-10% drop. I haven't recorded it, but it's very, very slow. I've ground through tons of AD rep, about to get to the point where I can't get it from non-elite mobs anymore, and the drops are just really really infrequent.<br /><br />Plus the camping is a pain. The best place is that first graveyard from Chill-whatever camp, but it's camped 24/7 by bots. I keep reporting them but they're still there!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Everybody camps around chillwind cus it has low lvl mobs wich gives the same rep as higher ones so it's no point in reporting bots cus if it's not bots it's normal players who either quests or grinds Argent Dawn rep.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't really think there is a GOOD place to farm them, because everyone who is after them is going to be testing the same spots as you. Just kinda have to deal with it.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't say they're <i>easy</i> to farm, but they are easier to get than the Crypt Fiend Parts, which as far as I know, are the only other things that can be turned in for Insignias of the Crusade. Sorrow Hill and either of the two lower level cauldron farms in WPL are the best choices, I think. Yeah, you're likely going to be competing with other people, but it beats waiting on the Crypt Fiend spawns in Fungal Vale/Noxious Glade/Terrordale for five minutes after you kill all FIVE of them (Terrorweb Tunnel might be a decent spot, but 90% of the time I go there, it's empty, and when it's not, it's also being patrolled by a level 60 elite).<br /><br />Besides that, we've been competing with people over the Sorrow Hill/Felstone Field undeads since LOOOOOONG before 1.11, so comparatively, it's not that bad. Just time consuming. But so is everything in this game. That's why we play it. ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>But the added value of questing is that you get an extra load of exp on top of the exp you got for killing the mobs, or just for doing stupid things like delivering letters to npc's. I got well over 6000 for turning in a letter the other night, and I didn't have to waste a drop of mana for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i was really disappointed with the droprate on these. if blizzard can't come up with anything else than grinding, they could at least make sure there's at least semi-decent droprate.<br /><br />anyway, i found the best place to grind them is in Andorhal. by far the place with most skeleton mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The elites in the destroyed watch towers of Andorhal can drop multiple Bone Fragments and should be soloable by well geared players.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, I know Allakhazam users haven't killed Dread Weavers 250k times since patch, so the drop rate percentage information is useless unless the kill info is reset.<br /><br />Anyone know what genuinely drops these most frequently outside of Strat/Scholo?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I farm for em in WPL around araj, plenty-o-skeletons there.<br />Ive also farmed EPL for em too. Anywhere there are skeletons. I think in EPL the skeletons are the armored ones tho, but they still drop the fragments :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As everyone below has stated, the best overall place to farm these is in Andorhal. The skeletons there are weak and drop quickly. There is a higher drop rate form the EPL skeletons, but they are quite a bit more difficult to down, and slow down your kill rate considerably unless you are in epic gear. If you are in epics though I'd farm Plaguewood, out in front of Stratholme, or around the other Zigaruts in EPL. Those will yield better fragments with chances of Crypt Fiend parts as well. All-in-all the crypt fiend parts and bone fragments are definitely the most pain in the butt to farm.</div>
