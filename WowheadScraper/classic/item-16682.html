Make sure that any on the left side of the group have their backs to you when you sneak past them. This is the trickiest part.)\n2) If you don't have any invis potions for whatever reason, you can carefully \"snipe\" the non-elites from the first group until you can successfully sneak to the left of the group. The trick is to open the gate, DPS, and frost nova when the gate closes and they're on top of you. Finish killing the non-elite and zone out fast. (Not fun but I did it so that I could get past the 1st group when I ran out of potions of invisibility)\n\n[b]Step 3: Find out if you need to reset the instance...[\/b]\nOk! Let's assume that you've snuck past the 1st group of undead. Now stay left and go through the gate until you see it open up into another large area.

In this case, he didn't spawn in 2 of his 4 areas. \n\nIf he DID get targeted when you typed \/target hearth, carefully find out which \"side\" he is on in the open area. If he's to the left... again you'll have to start over. You can't solo him if he's on the left. If he's on the right (along the wall to the right once you leave the gate tunnel), you can single pull him back without aggroing anything. Just be careful to watch the two patrols!

The fight is especially hard because he resists so dang much. It's nothing for him to resist 3 or 4 spells in a row.

I imagine that they could make sneaking past the 1st group a lot easier for you by running past it, feigning, and then afterwards aggroing the group away from the entrance so that you can sneak to the left without needing an invis potion.

Having two skeleton in the center and left positions at the first gate is definitely the easiest.&nbsp; You can reset the instance until you get this configuration if needed, but then you have to worry about the 5 resets per hour lock-out.&nbsp; \n\nClearing the left-most mobs is worth it so you can make an easy escape later (see below).&nbsp; Plus I didn't have any luck with the invis potions.&nbsp; IIRC, the skeletons had about 2800-2900 health.&nbsp; Here's the easiest way I found to clear them solo as a frost mage (w\/ +dmg gear for Frostbolt averages from 850-900ish).\n\n&nbsp; - Target one of the left skeletons\n&nbsp; - Open the gate\n&nbsp; - Fire Blast to get initial aggro.\n&nbsp; - Immediately start backing up.\n&nbsp; - Just before the mobs reach you, cast CoC to slow those in the front of the pack.\n&nbsp; - Keep backing up and once the back mobs have caught up with the slowed one, Frost Nova.\n&nbsp; - Turn around and blink to near the entrance.\n&nbsp; - Turn back and cast Frostbolt, Fire Blast, and hopefully another Frostbolt by the time the mobs reach you.&nbsp; Target should be dead.&nbsp; If not, spam Arcane Explosion as you zone out of the instance.\n&nbsp; - Repeat for each non-elite skeleton.\n\n1b. Even if you have cadavers in the left-most spots and don't want to reset the instance for whatever reason (e.g. almost at hourly reset limit), this is still soloable, but hard.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Optional: Clear the non-elite skeletons first.&nbsp; This makes it much easier.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - When you're left with only elite cadavers, open the gate and move in to the left.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Mobs will aggro.&nbsp; Keep moving.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Cone of Cold for initial damage\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Frost Nova to freeze them.&nbsp; \n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Blink to the west.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Turn and do standard AOE tactic (i.e. 2 Blizzards, CoC, Frost Nova, Blink, Repeat).\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - In addition to this, I had to throw in a few Fire Blasts to kill the first cadaver.&nbsp; They have about 9K health.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Once the \"targeted\" Cadaver is dead (should die first if you're throwing in Fire Blasts), either continue AOEing the others or zone if OOM.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Repeat if necessary.&nbsp; Yes, a pain.\n\nAlso recommend Mana Ruby, Mana and\/Healing potions available, any other mana restore trinkets, robes, etc. cooled down.&nbsp; Ice Barrier was also invaluable.\n\nHEARTHSINGER FORRESTEN\n\nThe above posts cover clearing to and killing Hearthsinger pretty well.&nbsp; Few comments as a Frost Mage:\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - He doesn't have a lot of HPs.&nbsp; Maybe 3.5-4K IIRC.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Yes, he's VERY resistant to spells, particularly to frost and arcane.&nbsp; On multiple attempts I would get roughly 50%+ of Frostbolts resisted and Arcane Missiles were doing 100-150 each.&nbsp; (This is with roughly 250 +spell dmg gear.)&nbsp; Definitely favor % chance to hit and resistance reducing gear over +dmg gear, if you have any.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Clear the mob nearest to him then zone out so you don't have to kill the linked group. \n&nbsp; &nbsp; - I led the fight with a Fireball.&nbsp; Yes, even as a frost mage.&nbsp; Lucked out and it did full damage so the fight was on!\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Fireblast then pull him to the tunnel.&nbsp; If you're lucky, he should be down to about 2K health.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Stand at the tunnel entrance so you can hide when needed.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Now hide for a second to pull him within range of Fire Blast, then move back out.&nbsp; He should start shooting his arrows at you.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Fireblast+nuke with whatever works (Fireball, Frostbolt, AM).\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Watch your health!&nbsp; Use Ice Barrier, Healing Potions, Mana Ruby liberally.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Mana shield didn't appear to block his arrows.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - I even had to duck behind the wall near the end to use bandages without being interrupted (300 first aid).&nbsp; This will cause him to move to the corner of the tunnel entrance where you're hiding.&nbsp; Once bandaging was done, I cast Frost Nova through the wall to block him, refreshed Ice Barrier and then finished him off.\n\nYes, lot of detail here, but I figured the more the merrier.&nbsp; Hopefully this and the good posts above will save you some time.\n\nBtw, he didn't drop the boots!&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Got the piccolo, but heading back tonight.","date":"2006-09-16T15:44:52-05:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"stoik-dh","importedSubject":"Hearthsinger - Frost Mage Solo"},{"commentv2":1,"number":33,"id":3054376,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Went at lvl 58 and talked my group into killin him and got my boots the First try....also had a Brainhacker drop in the same run so it was a good day.","date":"2005-11-05T01:27:13-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Darkkenchild","importedSubject":"HAHA"},{"commentv2":1,"number":34,"id":3054377,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Yeah, the postmaster ain't the problem.

But then I looked at his other drops.  MMM the psotmaster set.  I have every piece except the headband.  The funny thing is...  Out of however many runs I have killed this guy (think I have seen the tunic 3x, ring 3x, pants 2x, mace 2x, and foot 2x), I have still not seen the magi boots drop.  You could say I was still going for my initial goal =P\n\nAnyways, yeah these are more than a #$%^& to get...  you don't need a scarlet strat group to do it though.  Find a group for UD or Scarlet, then if you know some of them, BEG BEG BEG for the love of god and all that is holy!  Keep telling them that you are almost done.  Another thing, it REALLY REALLY sucks if you get the \"Crusader's Square Postbox Key\" when you are doing UD, or the \"Elder's Square Postbox Key\" when you are doing Scarlet.  At that point I usually explain to the group the situation and ask them if they will continue.  Usually a no, but then you have backup keys for future runs in case that happens again...\n\nPeople sometimes are really dumb when your group is doing UD and they don't understand the concept of entering the Scarlet entrance for the postmaster.  I'm being completely serious when I say this because I have had to explain the world and its wonders to get them to realize how the courier and postmaster work.  It's okay to go through UD and herd the group to the courier that way... It will end up easier when you open the postboxes because chances are you will get either King's Square, Festival Lane, Frias Siabi, or Elder's Square.  By that time you would have cleared them all.\n\nSo bottom line... beg and tell your group you know what you are doing.  Don't !@#$% at anyone or they will hate you.  And thank them every time because I have learned in my experiences how much people HATE killing the postmaster.\n\n-This has been Mcfloyd from Dethecus with your comprehensive guide to killing the Postmaster (my life's work)","date":"2005-07-12T07:25:03-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"rofl, gotta give it a try now :D","creationdate":"2005-07-25T16:37:07-05:00","id":1275785,"rating":0,"commentid":3054388,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"yonie","importedSubject":"RE: you guys are funny..."},{"body":"...done.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>They do not drop off the trolls.<br />They do not drop off Baroness Anastari.<br /><br />For the love of all things holy, they drop off Postmaster Malown. Yes, he's annoying as hell to kill. Even more annoying to find a group willing to do it. Magister's Boots dropped the first time on my 60 mage that we killed him, lucky lvl 59 won it. But the point being is, IT DROPS OFF MALOWN.<br /><br />If someone says otherwise, they're lying. Check every site that has info on WoW's armor, and it will say that these boots drop off Malown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just because the belt dropped from the trolls doesnt mean that all the other set items drop from em. Every Bind on Pickup set item drops from 1 boss, and 1 boss alone and Every Bind on Equip item drops from several different trashmobs.<br /><br />Killed Postmaster a total of 3 times now. First time he dropped his tunic, which is very nice if the best thing you have is Arcane Armor. I was the only one that needed it and got it.<br />Second time did it with some friends and he dropped his ring which i didnt need (isn't really a mage ring)<br />Third time he finally dropped the boots, but it was a pickup party and i had to roll against another mage. He rolled 72 and I 68. I got so fed up with postmaster that i quickly looked at my wallet, 290g, and whispered him my offer of 200g which he gladly accepted. I never want to see Malowne again!<br /><br />Just that it dropped the third time doesnt mean anything. With this boss the problem is finding the group that wants to do this. Metalmachine's analogy is quite correct.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You enter Stratholme through the main gate.Kill the mobs and go left.<br />Kill mobs then go left again.You ll find a mailbox at the end of the path(if in 5 man group you can finish the tobacco quest there too).<br />When you attempt to open the mailbox the Stratholme courier pops up with adds.<br />Kill him and you get random mailbox keys.<br />Find the proper mailboxes all over stratholme and at the last one that you open, the postmaster appears along with mobs.<br />He's tough to kill and also his curses are bad.<br />Make sure to decurse groups cause the curses he throws are bad and they also stack!<br />Good luck with the boots.<br />6th run today for me and for the 6th time his tunic dropped.<br />........No comments........</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1) Get a grp of friends..... i cant stress this enough.... if they are you friends chances are that they will be more than happy to help you kill the bicth that drops the boots.<br /><br />2) Go into SM strat... dont take the back door for the love of all things noobish.<br /><br />3) As you clear, go left and left again into a deadend...<br /><br />4) There is a named there... go do what mages do best... NUKE/deCURSE.<br /><br />5) they guy drops abunch of keys... make sure you get them. they are VERY important.<br /><br />6) Scattered throughout strat, there are abunch of boxes associated with the keys. As you clear mobs, be on the lookout.<br /><br />7) Open box #1... 3 lvl 58+elite ghost pop out.... have ur priest shakle one.... then have all the other ppl in the grp kill... as a mage, you only get to DECURSE... <br /><br />8) Open box #2... same thing as step #7<br /><br />9) The THIRD box is infront of the steps to the Scarlet building... open box.<br /><br />10) This is where the #$%^&amp; spawns..... with 3 other elites.... BTW the postmaster himself CAN be shakled... make sure ur priest does that. kill the other 3 mobs first. SPAM DECURSE over and over. Hopefully you dont wipe but if you do, just run back... all 4 guys stay spawnd for some time... that is why you kill of the postmaster bodygaurds FIRST and save the postmaster for last.<br /><br />11) Kill the f---ing #$%^&amp; and loot ur boots.<br /><br />12) Magister boots didnt drop? Portal to IF and begin at step 1....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>k you guys are just a bunch of complainers no offence. i would do stratholme or w/e as many times as i needed to get theese cause for one thing your at 58 you need the exp anyway and another thing its a set. so if you dont hav ethe whole set you are prolly gonna get another piece or that piece of it and since its a set its worth doing it that many times to get it. the bonuses that come with the set are very good and i will do this instance as many time i need to get these boots and the other pieces</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For Mages, as of 1.10...<br /><br />I just did this two-man as a 60 mage with a 60 druid, but I recommend 3 people, as we died a few times trying.<br /><br />Go into Strat using the side entrance (Baron side).&nbsp; Buff up and get ready for some AoE.&nbsp; You need to open the gate, run out with your healer(s), and go crazy on the first group (make sure everyone runs out and away from the gate, as staying behind it or even near it when it closes will result in &quot;Not in line of sight&quot; issues).&nbsp; Kiting doesn't really work, as there will usually be multiple caster type skeletons using frost spells.&nbsp; Hopefully you have the mana pool and support to kill them all.&nbsp; This is the hardest part.<br /><br />Once the first group is dead, head to your left and into the tunnel, being careful not to aggro the other undead in the plaza.&nbsp; Hug the right side of the tunnel, creep up, and look around the corner to your right, hopefully seeing Hearthsinger Forresten standing a short distance away under the eave of a building.&nbsp; He looks like a ghostly human soldier.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can just type /tar h from as far back as the middle of the tunnel, and it should target him if he is there.&nbsp; If he is not there, leave the instance and reset/repeat until he spawns there.<br /><br />Annoyingly, between you and Hearthsinger there will almost always be a skeleton.&nbsp; If you try to tag Hearthsinger, it will aggro the skeleton, and the skeleton will aggro a nearby group.&nbsp; (EDIT:&nbsp; Some reports indicated Hearthsinger will not aggro nearby undead when pulled.&nbsp; My experience of aggroing the skeleton when I pulled him may be the result of a simultanous body pull).&nbsp; To deal with this, you can either AoE that whole group, or quickly nuke that single skeleton to death from long range (which will aggro the rest of the group), then run out of the instance.&nbsp; I recommend having someone stand by the exit gate so they can open it for you as you train out.&nbsp; In either event, there are two pats (a ghoul and an abomination) that wander through that area, so be careful not to pull them as well.<br /><br />Once you take care of that problem, Hearthsinger is a push-over.&nbsp; He is ranged, so tag him, then LoS pull him back into the tunnel.&nbsp; He does not hit hard at all, but he can charm, and seems to have some magical resistance.&nbsp; Just nuke him to death, loot, and enjoy!<br /><br />The first time I tried this, he wasn't at that spawn point.&nbsp; I reset once, he appeared, and dropped Magister Boots first kill.&nbsp; Reset and tried again just for fun, and he was there again; again dropped Magister Boots.<br /><br />Magister Boots may now be the most easily farmed set piece in the game, if my experience was typical.&nbsp; Kinda makes up for all that Postmaster garbage :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i helped a mage friend with this and we 2 manned it, but it was rather close (me in tier 1, he got blues).<br />Actually i could pull Hearthsinger without aggroing the skeleton and the nearby group. If i moonfired him from max distance and ran back he would follow me without aggroing anything else, and then of course he is easy as hell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went through the back door of Strat.. took a hard left and typed /target hf under the bridge/tunnel/gate (whatever).. if he is at two of his four spawn spots he will come up as a target if not just exit regroup and try again.. really it takes like 5 min to get to that point, I talked a group of four into doing it three times while we waited for a tank to fly in... got my boots on the third try.. THANK GOD blizz made this a easier drop to get. If you are still confusied on where he spawns.. get atlas, that addon shows all four spots.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dropped for me yesterday off hearthsinger forresten. He is not rare anymore thus it look though, hes four places to spawn at. and he also changes his position while u r in strat. anyway took me about ten runs to getem. if hes on the right side u can pull him straight away, without killing any mobs, HE WONT AGGRO THE SKELETON AS SAID ABOVE.....<br />I just did 5 runs a day and there i am. most easily set item in game to get. nice work blizz. but barons ultimatum is gdmn hard. ive tried sofar like 10 runs and best success was to get to baroness in 5 mins, slaying her in 8....<br />anyway if someone needs help on darksorrow /w cripplathor</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, I've killed hearthsinger forresten at least 12-14 times already and he has yet to drop magister boots.&nbsp; Everytime I kill him I see stuff he always drops, never anything new, am I killing the right guy or am I just seriously unlucky?<br /><br />any advice would be greatly appreciated</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, to solo this guy you need the Key to the City and preferably some invis potions to sneak to the left of the first group.<br /><br /><b>Step 1: Go in...</b><br />Go into the UD Strat (Baron side) entrance and enter the instance. <br /><br /><b>Step 2: Sneak as far left as you can and get past the 1st group...</b><br />Once you unlock the gate you have two options-- <br />1) Use the invisibility potion to sneak past the first group <br />(Side Note: Any Cadavers (elites) of this first group can see invis. Make sure that any on the left side of the group have their backs to you when you sneak past them. This is the trickiest part.)<br />2) If you don't have any invis potions for whatever reason, you can carefully &quot;snipe&quot; the non-elites from the first group until you can successfully sneak to the left of the group. The trick is to open the gate, DPS, and frost nova when the gate closes and they're on top of you. Finish killing the non-elite and zone out fast. (Not fun but I did it so that I could get past the 1st group when I ran out of potions of invisibility)<br /><br /><b>Step 3: Find out if you need to reset the instance...</b><br />Ok! Let's assume that you've snuck past the 1st group of undead. Now stay left and go through the gate until you see it open up into another large area. Do a &quot;/target hearth&quot;... <br /><br />If it says, &quot;invalid target&quot; you have to go back, reset the instance, and start over again. In this case, he didn't spawn in 2 of his 4 areas. <br /><br />If he DID get targeted when you typed /target hearth, carefully find out which &quot;side&quot; he is on in the open area. If he's to the left... again you'll have to start over. You can't solo him if he's on the left. If he's on the right (along the wall to the right once you leave the gate tunnel), you can single pull him back without aggroing anything. Just be careful to watch the two patrols! (The ghoul and abomination.) They do their rounds in this area and I don't need to tell you what happens if they add, lol.<br /><br /><b>Step 4: The Fight...</b> <br />Ok, I've got the full Champion PvP Mage set, I'm cold talent specced, AND he killed me more than I killed him. The fight is especially hard because he resists so dang much. It's nothing for him to resist 3 or 4 spells in a row. I can't really help on this part... you'll have to wing it and figure out how you can kill him. <br /><br /><b>Afterthought:</b> <br />I suggest bringing a hunter friend along so that they can help. I imagine that they could make sneaking past the 1st group a lot easier for you by running past it, feigning, and then afterwards aggroing the group away from the entrance so that you can sneak to the left without needing an invis potion. If I had it to do over again, I would have definitely got a hunter friend to do this as it would have saved me a lot of trouble and made the fight with Hearthsinger much easier.<br /><br />-- It took me a few hours (too many instance resets) and 7 times soloing this thing for the boots to drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Mage + Rogue got Magister's Boots on 1st attempt tonight so they don't sound all that rare from what I see on other posts. Thanks Jaklar for your superb guide.<br /><br />The entrance is tough and forresten hits pretty damn hard... bring a friend or be veeeerrry patient!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Foresten was cheap. A Pyroblast and 2 Fireballs and he said good night. If you dont know where to find, get the latest Atlas Mod, the possible spawn locations are listed there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I�ve killed him 7 times now and no boots yet.&nbsp; A frost mage and priest can do with without any special gear.&nbsp; Priest uses mind vision to see if he is in the right place.&nbsp; If he is, the mage takes off his gear, throws up mana shield and opens the gate while the priest stands back.&nbsp; Run out, agro that mob, and head for the tunnel to the left.&nbsp; Use blink to get some distance.&nbsp; When they slow you down (or when you reach the tunnel) use Ice Block.&nbsp; At this time it should be all clear for the priest to open the gate and hug the wall.&nbsp; Ice block goes down and they kill you. (This is why you took off your gear.)&nbsp; Priest resurrects you, you buff up, then go take out Hearthsinger.&nbsp; With the priest healing you it should not be much of a problem.<br /><br />The problem I keep running into is resetting the instance so he shows up in the right place.&nbsp; I keep running into the 5 instance per hour limit.&nbsp; I went through 3 different priests last night just getting him to spawn in the right place 6 times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Walked into UD Strat, saw the Rare spawn up to the left.&nbsp; Killed him and got the boots...&nbsp; Wasn't even looking for them as I had heard such horror stories abou getting them.&nbsp; Just be sure to look for him in UD to the left after the second pull.<br /><br />Maybe they made this easier in 1.10?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Could someone who knows the various places for where this guys spawns put up a map to show what places he might be?<br /><br />Is he a rare spawn or does he just spawn different places? Or both?<br /><br />I only know one place where he spawns, and thats Strat Scarlet just after you enter the &quot;Gate&quot; where the Rat trap is... Then he sometimes stands on opposite side as you exit that &quot;gate&quot;.<br /><br />/target heart is good to use as he is a bit &quot;invisable (like all other Ghost Citizens). <br /><br />Is it true that he can be pulled through UD groups without drawing agro?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was curious, so I entered ud-strat solo, did some hit &amp; runs killing the mobs in the way (invisibility potions don't work to sneak past the first group). Hearthsinger was there, to the left when i went to the end of that tunnel. I used a fireball to pull then ran into the tunnel. Used all my cd's and a combat healing potion and boss went splat. Magister's boots and Scourgestone dropped. First attempt. ;)<br /><br />Takes more effort maybe, compared to finding some friends to help you, but it's soloable, and can be done at your own leisure.<br /><br />Good luck to you all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As for the last 2 posters.. I have no clue what they are doing.&nbsp; But I've been going into the instance using them and sneaking past the first group.&nbsp; There just cant be a cadaver in front of the gate or to the left, both have to be skeletons.<br /><br />Note: Open the gate FIRST then use the potion.&nbsp; If you open the gate after it will cancel the effect.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have now downed hearthsinger 14 times, only to reveil no magisters boots.&nbsp; I never did with with pots though, I just went in with a group each time.&nbsp; Does it have to be solo'd or 3 manned to increase the drop rate?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The locations of some of the waist, wrist, and hand slot pieces of the dungeon armor sets have been moved from their old creatures, including the Lightforge Gauntlets and the <i>Magister's Boots.</i> Additional creature types can also drop many of the previously difficult to obtain armor pieces.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tried this morning, after we couldnt get enough for a full baron group, so me and a hunter tried, from one of the guides above i got the idea, (the really long and full guide), he was right about a hunter making it alot easier, by running right feigning, then grabbing aggro running away while i ran left,(no need for invisibility pots) anyway, 2nd attempt he was in the right place, had to kill Skeletal Guardian first, hunter got pet and quickly killed him, feigned death, group goes away, that makes it free to pull foresten, (down on the left) he's damn easy to kill, his hp is crap. but unfortianately -_- Songbird Blouse drops, after about 4 more resets he didnt spawn in the right place and hunter ahd to go, although i reccomend this route to get boots, alot easier, and funner than going all the way through.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>me and a mage were just AoE clearing thsi morning to get hearthsinger, we killed Hearthsinger 5 times - 2 piccolos, 3 songbird blouses (i killed him twice before only to get a songbird blouse &amp; rainbow girdle)Well. atleast its better than doing 7 FULL baron runs -_-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have killed him around 15 times and nothing.&nbsp; I did figure out, though, that you can actually blink past the first set of mobs.&nbsp; It takes good timing, and be ready to run out if it doesn't work. You stand clear to the left side of the gate.&nbsp; Then, open the gate, hug the left wall, and blink right about at the pile of rubble that is there.&nbsp; The blink method works for me about 20% of the time.&nbsp; To improve your chances, you might want to try killing the mob closest to the gate, and the one just to the left of that one.&nbsp; It will probably take killing one, running out, killing the other, running out, and then come back in and blink out of aggro range.&nbsp; If you are going to solo Hearth, it can be tough.&nbsp; He resisted almost all of my frost spells.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is a link to mbe blinking past.&nbsp; Sorry it's a little hard to see. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/F4ZGJE0oVpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/v/F4ZGJE0oVpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>read comments before attempting to solo, everything needs to line up properly to make it past w/o a fight. you cannot blink past. they are linked to the corner<br /><br />after run number whatever, somewhere close to 10, where i could actually kill hearthsinger, the boots finally dropped. excitement was upon me.<br /><br />USE ELIXIRS OF DREAM VISION! they save so much time.&nbsp; use them, till you get the perfect setup. 2 non-elites near the gate and hearthsinger on the right. then still take someone with you, he's hard to solo. a priest works great, but anyone will work. if you hit your spawn limit, farm outside.<br /><br />his magical arrows go through mana shield since they aren't physical damage. but ice barrier will work. or just bring a good healing pot. <br /><br />what a pain in the ass, not easy, but definately doable for a grp of 2, possibly 1 if you're good and/or lucky</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Above posts are very good, especially those about his resistances.&nbsp; If you can avoid doing this solo, I HIGHLY recommend it.&nbsp; It would be a cake walk if you get ANY help.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone at 2AM last night, so, as a frost mage, I had to struggle to take him out solo.&nbsp; Here are my two cents from the experience:<br /><br />Dream Vision Potion: As posted above, definitely worth the coin to buy some Dream Vision potions.&nbsp; They'll pay for themselves with equipment repair savings.&nbsp; Simply open the gate (without aggroing mobs of course), step back quickly, drink the potion, then move forward immediately before the gate closes.<br /><br />FIRST GROUP OF MOBS<br /><br />1a. Having two skeleton in the center and left positions at the first gate is definitely the easiest.&nbsp; You can reset the instance until you get this configuration if needed, but then you have to worry about the 5 resets per hour lock-out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Clearing the left-most mobs is worth it so you can make an easy escape later (see below).&nbsp; Plus I didn't have any luck with the invis potions.&nbsp; IIRC, the skeletons had about 2800-2900 health.&nbsp; Here's the easiest way I found to clear them solo as a frost mage (w/ +dmg gear for Frostbolt averages from 850-900ish).<br /><br />&nbsp; - Target one of the left skeletons<br />&nbsp; - Open the gate<br />&nbsp; - Fire Blast to get initial aggro.<br />&nbsp; - Immediately start backing up.<br />&nbsp; - Just before the mobs reach you, cast CoC to slow those in the front of the pack.<br />&nbsp; - Keep backing up and once the back mobs have caught up with the slowed one, Frost Nova.<br />&nbsp; - Turn around and blink to near the entrance.<br />&nbsp; - Turn back and cast Frostbolt, Fire Blast, and hopefully another Frostbolt by the time the mobs reach you.&nbsp; Target should be dead.&nbsp; If not, spam Arcane Explosion as you zone out of the instance.<br />&nbsp; - Repeat for each non-elite skeleton.<br /><br />1b. Even if you have cadavers in the left-most spots and don't want to reset the instance for whatever reason (e.g. almost at hourly reset limit), this is still soloable, but hard.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Optional: Clear the non-elite skeletons first.&nbsp; This makes it much easier.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - When you're left with only elite cadavers, open the gate and move in to the left.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Mobs will aggro.&nbsp; Keep moving.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Cone of Cold for initial damage<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Frost Nova to freeze them.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Blink to the west.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Turn and do standard AOE tactic (i.e. 2 Blizzards, CoC, Frost Nova, Blink, Repeat).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - In addition to this, I had to throw in a few Fire Blasts to kill the first cadaver.&nbsp; They have about 9K health.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Once the &quot;targeted&quot; Cadaver is dead (should die first if you're throwing in Fire Blasts), either continue AOEing the others or zone if OOM.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Repeat if necessary.&nbsp; Yes, a pain.<br /><br />Also recommend Mana Ruby, Mana and/Healing potions available, any other mana restore trinkets, robes, etc. cooled down.&nbsp; Ice Barrier was also invaluable.<br /><br />HEARTHSINGER FORRESTEN<br /><br />The above posts cover clearing to and killing Hearthsinger pretty well.&nbsp; Few comments as a Frost Mage:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - He doesn't have a lot of HPs.&nbsp; Maybe 3.5-4K IIRC.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Yes, he's VERY resistant to spells, particularly to frost and arcane.&nbsp; On multiple attempts I would get roughly 50%+ of Frostbolts resisted and Arcane Missiles were doing 100-150 each.&nbsp; (This is with roughly 250 +spell dmg gear.)&nbsp; Definitely favor % chance to hit and resistance reducing gear over +dmg gear, if you have any.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Clear the mob nearest to him then zone out so you don't have to kill the linked group. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - I led the fight with a Fireball.&nbsp; Yes, even as a frost mage.&nbsp; Lucked out and it did full damage so the fight was on!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Fireblast then pull him to the tunnel.&nbsp; If you're lucky, he should be down to about 2K health.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Stand at the tunnel entrance so you can hide when needed.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Now hide for a second to pull him within range of Fire Blast, then move back out.&nbsp; He should start shooting his arrows at you.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Fireblast+nuke with whatever works (Fireball, Frostbolt, AM).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Watch your health!&nbsp; Use Ice Barrier, Healing Potions, Mana Ruby liberally.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Mana shield didn't appear to block his arrows.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - I even had to duck behind the wall near the end to use bandages without being interrupted (300 first aid).&nbsp; This will cause him to move to the corner of the tunnel entrance where you're hiding.&nbsp; Once bandaging was done, I cast Frost Nova through the wall to block him, refreshed Ice Barrier and then finished him off.<br /><br />Yes, lot of detail here, but I figured the more the merrier.&nbsp; Hopefully this and the good posts above will save you some time.<br /><br />Btw, he didn't drop the boots!&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Got the piccolo, but heading back tonight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Went at lvl 58 and talked my group into killin him and got my boots the First try....also had a Brainhacker drop in the same run so it was a good day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, the postmaster ain't the problem. Finding a pt who's willing to do Srat and the postmaster realy sucks :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>first off there ain't ANY OTHER set peice item that requires so much bs!<br />we mages get screwed ouf of everything, from the low magister helm drop rate to the boots.<br /><br />first of all Malown is a pain to kill so this is what u do:<br /><br />first enter strat from the main entrance<br />kill the mobs near the beginning<br />take first left<br />take another left<br />clear mobs of that area<br />kill courier<br />kill the undead guy who spawns<br />loot keys (doesnt matter who loots but I always like to take keys myself because I'm usually the only guy who knows how to spawn him)<br />open up mailboxes according to the keys (they're are street signs. mailboxes easy to find)<br />kill the postman guys who spawn out of those boxes<br />on your third opening postmaster will spawn along with a few postmen. make sure u clear the area first because this dude curses alot.<br />mages your role would be to decurse rather then damage deal.<br />and I dont know about you but my spells seemed to do half the normal damage on the postmen and malown (probably because they're spirits)<br /><br />and finally good luck on your magisters. killed him 5 times so far and no magister :(<br />1) postmaster treads. i think fair enough, best boots to get untill magister<br />2) legs, priest got it<br />3) tunic (chest)<br />4) postmaster seal (finger)<br />5) tunic (chest) again. at this rate I could've collected the whole postmaster set rather then magister set. :S<br /><br />this guy BLOWS<br /><br />- EDIT: Happy to report on the 6th I got them! yay! I feel for you mages that have to through this BS! But at the same time I can only just laugh ;)<br /><br />Edited, Wed Jun 1 13:37:40 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Killed Postmaster a total of 3 times now. First time he dropped his tunic, which is very nice if the best thing you have is Arcane Armor. I was the only one that needed it and got it.<br />Second time did it with some friends and he dropped his ring which i didnt need (isn't really a mage ring)<br />Third time he finally dropped the boots, but it was a pickup party and i had to roll against another mage. He rolled 72 and I 68. I got so fed up with postmaster that i quickly looked at my wallet, 290g, and whispered him my offer of 200g which he gladly accepted. I never want to see Malowne again!<br /><br />Just that it dropped the third time doesnt mean anything. With this boss the problem is finding the group that wants to do this. Metalmachine's analogy is quite correct.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The only other piece of equipment that requires this much crap is possbile the Devout shoulders. No one wants to do the rookery event. But ive done more rookery runs then post master. Noone ever wants to run the postmaster because it takes forever. When you do get a group together there are always like 4-5 mages. THese are so difficult to get. Im gonna focus on getting arcanist that's easier.<br /><br />EDIT and on top of that the stats are better on the postmaster treads then on the magister boots. Gay blizzard needs to fix. <br /><br />Edited, Thu Jun 30 16:31:15 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How do u solo this guy. IM a mage wanna solo him plz tell =)))))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You guys don't even want to know the shenanigans I had to go through to get these boots. They're not even that spectacular. Multiple times groupes invited me in after i specifically asked &quot;im here for the postmaster, is that ok?&quot; ... only to decide not to do it. I don't get it. If you have a party member that needs something you do it. On top of five failed or no-drop pickup runs my guild also did 5 zergs through. I got the postmaster's boots 2x as well ... yay. <br /><br />ps if u wipe better have SS or ankh... postmaster despawns after some time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The problem here is finding someone who actually WANTS to do postmaster runs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>managed to convince two groups to do this and BOTH times Postmaster's Band fell - go figure, the one item that supposedly drops less than 1%</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Did live for the first time since the patch, and he was in the far corner spot, but he dropped them. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i have tried 4 more times after posting this and well still no hearthsinger this morning and its not costing me 6 gold to repair after failing that blink action a few times.<br /><br />:P<br /><br />i will keep trying, I want the sorcerer set.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>At first I was killing the postmaster to get these boots... But then I looked at his other drops. MMM the psotmaster set. I have every piece except the headband. The funny thing is... Out of however many runs I have killed this guy (think I have seen the tunic 3x, ring 3x, pants 2x, mace 2x, and foot 2x), I have still not seen the magi boots drop. You could say I was still going for my initial goal =P<br /><br />Anyways, yeah these are more than a #$%^&amp; to get... you don't need a scarlet strat group to do it though. Find a group for UD or Scarlet, then if you know some of them, BEG BEG BEG for the love of god and all that is holy! Keep telling them that you are almost done. Another thing, it REALLY REALLY sucks if you get the &quot;Crusader's Square Postbox Key&quot; when you are doing UD, or the &quot;Elder's Square Postbox Key&quot; when you are doing Scarlet. At that point I usually explain to the group the situation and ask them if they will continue. Usually a no, but then you have backup keys for future runs in case that happens again...<br /><br />People sometimes are really dumb when your group is doing UD and they don't understand the concept of entering the Scarlet entrance for the postmaster. I'm being completely serious when I say this because I have had to explain the world and its wonders to get them to realize how the courier and postmaster work. It's okay to go through UD and herd the group to the courier that way... It will end up easier when you open the postboxes because chances are you will get either King's Square, Festival Lane, Frias Siabi, or Elder's Square. By that time you would have cleared them all.<br /><br />So bottom line... beg and tell your group you know what you are doing. Don't !@#$% at anyone or they will hate you. And thank them every time because I have learned in my experiences how much people HATE killing the postmaster.<br /><br />-This has been Mcfloyd from Dethecus with your comprehensive guide to killing the Postmaster (my life's work)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>30 Runs Now, and still no drop for my boots. Must be me, because all my guildies see it drop when I'm not around... 2 of our mages got them on their 1st try<br /><br />This is crazy. The drop rate is way off..... out of 30 tries, we got he woolies 21.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>even if I do not make it with the blink I still run over to see if he is there, then try a few times getting by them, today I actually made it but singer resisted a few cast and I dead.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, from a Warrior's point of view the Magister set is not so hard as it has 3 BoE items!<br /><br />The Valor set has only 1 BoE item and the Boots are a pain to get, even more so that Postmaster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just can't find him...there is a postbox that requires some key...but where the hell do I get the key from? Pls help me guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Do any other classes have this much difficulty with their parts? 3x Postmaster keys required to get an item is rediculous, not to mention why cant u just lockpick. Its a postbox!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm starting to get very pissed off. These thing's won't drop, and I'm getting really sick of looking at Strathome.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been soling this guy a lot and still nothing. I either get the blouse, the woolies, or the piccolo. I also saw that plate belt drop a few times. I have gone after him about 20 times per day over the last 4 days, and still nothing. About 25% of the time he's in the right spot to solo pull him. I have probably killed him around 20 times now and still no boots.<br /><br />However, I did figure out a way to blink past the first mobs inside the gate. I put a clip of it up on youtube.com. Just do a search on Jingild if you want to see it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I too celebrated the fact these boots were being moved from Malown to Hearthsinger. After doing 20 some odd Hearthsinger runs the past few days, I have yet to see the boots drop, and only seen one piccalo to boot. Pretty frustrating for me, can only imagine how the guy helping me feels about it :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i just wanna say<br /><br />OMFG you'd thing with 13% drop rate this would drop more often...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Umm...<br /><br />Yea, this guy is a total pain the ass. But, ask a pally whether/if they will go thru the trouble of getting their piece from the emperor in BRD.<br /><br />Id rather deal with this than what the pallies have to go thru.<br /><br />For the most part, if you have a group doing an undead raid, you can ask them if you can make a slight detour to this guy. It tacks 20 minutes to the run, but many are ok (especially guildees) with detouring to this.<br /><br />Only thing that is important is to make sure you are the only mage in the group. Nothing more annoying than killing this guy 20 times (I know, I have killed him 21 times and still havent seen the boots) to then have to deal with giving the boots to a level 57 on his first run thru simply because he won the roll.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was in a Scarlet Straholme group that was nice enough to do the Malown event. We wiped on him once, due to a ghost trap kill some of us. He came back, and killed him, and he dropped Malown's slam. -_-<br /><br />Luckily, 1.10 is today, and I can get Magister's Boots easier. Hopefully.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got it on my 2nd try =) he is easy to farm if you do him from the ud side. you only have to clear 4-5 rounds of mob then you pull him already.. unless he's somewhere else in live then it might be more of a pain =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i have solo'd this like 10 resets and no hearthsinger even there today.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>qy3prg3rkk</b></h3>So where do you even get these in &quot;Classic&quot;?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dkdraenei</b></h3>Does this drop off of Postmaster or Hearthsinger? Both bosses are listed in the comments. So confused.</div>
