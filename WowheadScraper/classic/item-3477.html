<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I couldn't get this to drop off of Forest Moss Creepers.&nbsp; I probably killed 3 dozen of them without a drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was beginning to get worried too, but I circled the camp 3 times and killed probably 20-30 spiders and finally got the drop Ichor drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was a lvl 35 warrior and farmed the entire area that Thottbot said this drop happened and more (went nth of Durnholde Keep).<br />As you can imagine I farmed the mobs pretty easily at that level but still took 45 mins to find one Creeper Ichor.&nbsp; <br />Found it north of Tarren Mill, just outside the guards reach.<br />Location = 59,13</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The location is not important.<br />They're all around the village.<br />As long as you kill Forest Moss Creepers you'll get it eventually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well this drop doesn't count as rare i think, it just counts as a reguluar loot. but the quest still suck, i've killed 50-80 all kinds of creepers and still no drop!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a ridiculously hard quest. ive been on it for a week now, not even a sign of it. Its a piece of crap i hate this! FOREST MOSS CREEPERS SUCK!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>killed in front of Southpoint Tower, too many ppl hunting by TM</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just got it, and well...it took me about 100 spiders...so its still the same</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the drop is still around 3% for the creepers around TM.&nbsp; Took me about 40 of them to get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&lt;3 my luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got mine at 61,10 - north of TM.&nbsp; Took forever - probably killed 60+ of the buggers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me 2,5 hours...<br />Reward: 1s 50 &amp; 1750 xp....<br /><br />this thing sucks :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After killing about a zillion spiders of all sorts, i found it on a lvl 24 giant moss spider (the green ones) right next to the river E of tarren mill. Coords (70,27).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>20 more kills and I got it. makes about 95 altogether.&nbsp; Plus I got a green 2h hammer as well from it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So I did this quest a few times with other toons, didn't even notice anything bad about a droprate (didn't even need to check thottbot)<br /><br />So here I am, 3am in the morning, lvl30 druid, thinking, oh lemme do this quickly and be done with it. They died really fast, so that was not the issue, but after killing 57 lvl21's and 55 lvl 20's I was about to give up and BAM drop. I was exciled. Worst part is I guess, you know that you killed so many, it just has to drop, maybe on the next one.<br /><br />About location, mine dropped south of the lake, been runnig circles killing every spider around Tarren Mill. So it's 4:30 now, gonna log. I did get some about 4x spider's silk, a couple of green items (not worth much though) and lots of crispspider meat and the like. Ended up with about a gold more then I started, so I farmed ... one gold an hour lol.<br /><br />What pisses me of most about this though is that I was just 2 lvl's to high to gain XP from it ....<br /><br />To any others doing this quest, just do it. Either as lvl 60, cos then you kill them like *snip* or anything between lvl 18 - 27, at least that way, you'll get some XP from it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It fianlly droped the bloody Creeper Ichor man that was a pain in the ass but i made about 50s out of it plus about 15k exp my kill was at 59,34</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got my drop after about 100 kills but the xp and money is <u>really</u> good</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dreaded doing this quest as I had suffered with it on three other characters. I used Thottbot's drop % to stay this side of river and killed spiders for 90 minutes. A friendly mage showed up and in chat said she was told the giant creepers had a better drop rate and got hers after 3 kills. So I crossed the bridge and got a drop on the first kill.<br /><br />How old are the records thottbot uses? If Blizzard changes drop rates, how long would it be before Thottbot's % were anyway near right?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>am&nbsp; pumata and am lv 27 i hevan't see the item i kill near 200 spiders</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Ichor dropped on about my 9th spider but Blizzard have the percentage so low for a good reason. Are you getting XP for each and every kill? Yup so don't whinge, it's called grinding and it's boring but it gets you XP but is what the first half of the game is all about.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dropped for me after four kills</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Go to the Bridge south of TM, got it on my second kill there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed like&nbsp; spiders before i got it... the secret is, just keep up the spirit^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I killed em for about 4 hours tonight. Nothing.<br /><br />Not even 1... which was all i needed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It can literally take hours for this thing to drop. Not worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i got it, dunno how many killed but i got 17 spider meat and 16 gooey legs with it, so i guess maybe 20-25 spiders</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Had to kill 20 Forest Moss Creeper's for a drop...<br />-.-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I only had to kill 8 spiders and it was mine hahaha!<br /><br />One of my guildmates grew 8 levels till she got it.. and then the quest was grey lol :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i hate this q:(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>damn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i've killed like 50 of them and i dont get it anytime</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate of the ichor turns this quest into utter crap.. blizz should increase it 4 sure.. this isn't fun in any way.. just ridiculous</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been killing creepers for over hours and nothing. I'm about ready to abandon. I don't think it's worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>juts don't focus on this Q. just kill them when u see them in other Qs, and if u get evrything u need for this Q, its a bonus</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nelzzi</b></h3>It seems like you should take &quot;near the village&quot; literally.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RenataKane</b></h3>Got it on the third try on one character. On another, I killed 62 Forest Creepers and 14 Giant Creepers, finally got it around Durnholde Keep. For every anecdote, there is an equal and opposite anecdote. It's all RNG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mfsabbath</b></h3>Looted mine just west of Durnholde Keep. ~70,40.</div>
