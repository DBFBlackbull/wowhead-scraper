Yes on some servers it is worth only 40-100g, know why?&nbsp; its because those servers are new.&nbsp; there is no base of senior players who have the time and money to really twink out alts; therefore many of those in the market will have a much lower income.&nbsp;

Lets compromise on 20g ok, but OMG 200? Are you MAD? Why?\n\nLet me show you something, it's called \"Rod of the Sleepwalker\"\n[item=1155] has THE SAME STATS, minus ONE SPIRIT, minus the damage\/healing increase.\nAlso, the damage is about 40% less.\n\nThe thing is, \"Rod of the Sleepwalker\" is only level 24 req! and can be got in like 2-5 runs the most at a level 24-27 instance. Meaning it should be quite easy to obtain and use it even before levlel30, arround level 28.\n\nSo what are the downsides? Well the 'Sleepwalker' does have less hit damage, making it less usefull for melee if you ARE 35+, but then again, a caster shouldn't get too close to combat anyway unless he is soloing and has no pet.\nAnother downside is the lack of healing\/spell damage add. Quite a shame, But\n-Non 'Healer' type casters won't lose that much the healing boost.\n-Mages would prefer Arcane\/Ice\/Fire adds.\n-Warlocks would prefer other specific (don't play a warlock so I don't really know)\n--Maybe an overal add is better for more spell types with EACH caster? As a Druid I only have Nature spells, so I don't really know, but my Mage friend preffers to go Ice\/Fire\/Arcane, I presume most do, I could be wrong.\n--Priests use Staffs? If so they would sure miss the healing boost.\n--Druids would sure benefit both ways from the staff and with their limited weapon choices, this IS crucial.\n---Druids will also definetlly use this staff in Combat, so the damage differance IS siginificant.\n\nSo in conclusion, the Jordan staff is a nice moving forward from the \"Rod of the Sleepwalker\" the \"illusionary Rod\"\n[item=7713] is the next step up which is a pain to choose since it has less damage and no spell enhance.\nIn either way, the Jordan Hardlly worths 20G in comparison to ANY of those two staffs, which aren't THAT hard to get in the appropriate levels.\nIt's only worth those 20G to\na DRUID (as someone did mention before, but I further explained), who is about to reach level 35. \nAt 40, you rather get yourself an \"illusionary Rod\", \nAt 30 or less go get the \"Rod of the Sleepwalker\".\n\nAnd if you're arround 20, go get the \"Icicle Rod\"\n[item=2950] \"Emberstone Staff\"\n[item=5201]","date":"2005-07-08T22:18:55-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SillyWind","importedSubject":"This Staff is so OVER RATED!

Prices range from 300-500g in the AH, depending on the price.<br />If you're rich enough, this staff is good enough to last you from lvl 35 to ~lvl 50.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Asher</b></h3>I would not waste my time trying to farm this, or even buy it. Sell it. The stats really aren't that great, and you will get something better that will be much cheaper and waste much less of your time.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7713">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7713</a> -- there is no +dmg, but it's not really that big of a deal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>28997</b></h3>The staff of jordan. the absolute best staff in the game for almost half the leveling portion of it. sure, other staves have more intellect, but that balance of int, spirit and raw spell power leave everything else in the dust, at least till you either hit 60 in the classic game, or 58 and get into outland. either way, this will take you clear from the mid 30's straight to there.<br /><br /> Also, i love how they made this thing so trade valuable... plus the plug from the trade channels on diablo 2 is simply priceless.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>46168</b></h3>This staff can serve a spellcaster for a long time. I got it in Uldaman off one of the basilisk. This staff is great for both PVE and PvP combat and is worth buying it if you got the money. I know ill be keeping it for a long time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>47377</b></h3>Great staff i plan on using at least until the outlands...the damage is amazing...great staff if you have the money get it imo</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Catalyze</b></h3>One important thing that this staff has going for it is that it is Level 35. This allows the newer Burning Crusades enchants to be placed on it. The Hypnotic Blade is level 34 and therefore is limited to the older (and on my server, extremely more expensive due to less mats in the AH) enchants. You can have a nice +30 Intell enchant on it or a +40 Spell damage enchant for a lot less than the older enchant (such as +22 Intell). This is also the reason that PvP twinks in the 29 brackets do the Master Hunter series of quests in STV since the rewards are level 35 and above. This allows the highest enchants to be used at levels far below 35.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hey is this staff a cameo from the &quot;Stone of Jordan&quot; in Diablo 2?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Those who think Illusionary is better must be kidding I hope.<br />Since +100 int = +1% crit chance on spells, Illusionary with its whopping 4 more int bonus would give +0,04% crit chance *LAUGHS*<br /><br />And +26 spell dmg does not work only on spells with dmg variance, nor it's a random bonus, it only depends on the casting time of the spell : long casting time spells like fireball get the full bonus, shorter to cast like scorch get a fraction ( roughly 43%, or it will unbalance the dps on these spells ). Source an official answer by a dev on the official boards ( can't find it now, but you can find yourself with a little research with google ).<br />For some items the bonus is actually random but it's clearly stated on the item ( example &quot;increase dmg done by spells by up to 1 to xx ).<br /><br />So in the end this staff would add 26 dmg on a roughly 300 dmg lvl 36 fireball, which means around 10% more dmg.<br />Hello? 10% more dmg vs 0.04% more crit chance, get a clue.<br />+70 hp from the illusionary can be useful in a duel, but actually you don't need it cause with 3 spells you'll deal 78 more dmg.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First, this staff is BRILLIANT for its level, the stats are poor, but 26 dmg is a LOT.&nbsp; soul harvester is better for warlocks, but other than that theres really no upgrade till you start raiding.&nbsp; so its good for 20 levels at least.&nbsp; put a +22 int on it at a cost of approx 100g (depending on server of course) and it becomes FAR better than GBS.<br /><br />As to cost.&nbsp; Yes on some servers it is worth only 40-100g, know why?&nbsp; its because those servers are new.&nbsp; there is no base of senior players who have the time and money to really twink out alts; therefore many of those in the market will have a much lower income.&nbsp; If people cant afford it, they wont pay 200+g.&nbsp; <br /><br />On my server however, Doomhammer, new character creation has been closed to new players, only those with characters already on the server can create new chars.&nbsp; that means ALL those players coming through the levels have high level alts, and therefore have MUCH more money.&nbsp; Im wanting to buy one for my lock twink, but because there is 50 other people out there wanting one also for their twinks, and only one staff drops a week or thereabouts, the demand is much higher.&nbsp; If i can get one for 250g ill be over the moon, in reality i expect to pay over 400g. <br /><br />New servers = not much money = its cheaper<br />established servers = much money = expensive<br /><br />is it good, hell yes.&nbsp; <br /><br />alternatives.... there are few.&nbsp; for warlocks, it may be worth running a dagger/offhand combo, the best in the range is<br /><br />Hypnotic blade<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4015/sterling-chain-armor">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4015/sterling-chain-armor</a><br /><br />with <br />orb of dar'orahil (or its fire dmg equivalent)<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Orb%20of%20Dar'Orahil">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Orb%20of%20Dar'Orahil</a><br /><br />both items are attainable about lvl 34 ish.&nbsp; (required for the blade, and itll be hard to do the quest for the offhand before lvl 38ish, bring friends and do it early)<br /><br />this gives a total of <br />13 int<br />3 spirit<br />+14 spell damage (EITHER fire or shadow)<br />a useless health regen buff (stacks with healthstone, so not much good)<br /><br />Another alternative is to simply take the staff of orahil.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13577">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13577</a><br /><br />as far as i am aware, there is no alternative such as this for other classes..... as shown even the warlock alternative is viable, but <i>still inferior</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Really, I wouldn't pay 10G for it, let alone more. Lets compromise on 20g ok, but OMG 200? Are you MAD? Why?<br /><br />Let me show you something, it's called &quot;Rod of the Sleepwalker&quot;<br /><a href="/classic/item=1155/rod-of-the-sleepwalker">Rod of the Sleepwalker</a> has THE SAME STATS, minus ONE SPIRIT, minus the damage/healing increase.<br />Also, the damage is about 40% less.<br /><br />The thing is, &quot;Rod of the Sleepwalker&quot; is only level 24 req! and can be got in like 2-5 runs the most at a level 24-27 instance. Meaning it should be quite easy to obtain and use it even before levlel30, arround level 28.<br /><br />So what are the downsides? Well the 'Sleepwalker' does have less hit damage, making it less usefull for melee if you ARE 35+, but then again, a caster shouldn't get too close to combat anyway unless he is soloing and has no pet.<br />Another downside is the lack of healing/spell damage add. Quite a shame, But<br />-Non 'Healer' type casters won't lose that much the healing boost.<br />-Mages would prefer Arcane/Ice/Fire adds.<br />-Warlocks would prefer other specific (don't play a warlock so I don't really know)<br />--Maybe an overal add is better for more spell types with EACH caster? As a Druid I only have Nature spells, so I don't really know, but my Mage friend preffers to go Ice/Fire/Arcane, I presume most do, I could be wrong.<br />--Priests use Staffs? If so they would sure miss the healing boost.<br />--Druids would sure benefit both ways from the staff and with their limited weapon choices, this IS crucial.<br />---Druids will also definetlly use this staff in Combat, so the damage differance IS siginificant.<br /><br />So in conclusion, the Jordan staff is a nice moving forward from the &quot;Rod of the Sleepwalker&quot; the &quot;illusionary Rod&quot;<br /><a href="/classic/item=7713/illusionary-rod">Illusionary Rod</a> is the next step up which is a pain to choose since it has less damage and no spell enhance.<br />In either way, the Jordan Hardlly worths 20G in comparison to ANY of those two staffs, which aren't THAT hard to get in the appropriate levels.<br />It's only worth those 20G to<br />a DRUID (as someone did mention before, but I further explained), who is about to reach level 35. <br />At 40, you rather get yourself an &quot;illusionary Rod&quot;, <br />At 30 or less go get the &quot;Rod of the Sleepwalker&quot;.<br /><br />And if you're arround 20, go get the &quot;Icicle Rod&quot;<br /><a href="/classic/item=2950/icicle-rod">Icicle Rod</a> &quot;Emberstone Staff&quot;<br /><a href="/classic/item=5201/emberstone-staff">Emberstone Staff</a></div>

I was soloing at the time collecting the 25 crystals for Willow. I about had a heart-attack as this was my first purple and my cousin informed me that at that moment there was one in AH starting at 900g with buyout at 1000g. After reading posts here I decided to open it at 400g and buyout at 600g. Even that made me feel a bit crazy. Within a few hours it was bought.

That and the stats are very sexy, i'm at am inpass at the moment becuase i'm trying to decide wether I should get 55 healing on the staff of 25 agi and 55 healing on the Hand of Righteousness and get a shield to go with it when i'm healbotting. But back on topic, this + WF = game over pally. Oh yes and this staff is a refereance to the ring in Diablo 2 called the Ring of Jordan which was a hot item to trade and craved by all the Korean player on the Ameican servers, and was used as a currency for some items.</div>

The 26 extra dmg / healing do not only have the advantage of the buff, but also that +magic gear (WITH stats!) is a good thing to gather as much as you can. More effective overall... Plus yeh it's purple and yeh it's got +magic stats so people will think it's pretty and good and perfect and it'll be my RolePlay gear for a long long time...</div>

Not only does it add +26 to all schools of magic, but has a nice smattering of int and spi. Compare this to the completely craptastic <a href="/classic/item=944/elemental-mage-staff">Elemental Mage Staff</a> Elemental Mage Staff +36 to frost and fire, zero to Arcane, and it is a level 56 epic with no int to boot (+20 resistance? I'll make up for it elsewhere thank you very much). We have a few mages in our guild who shoot for +dmg builds and not only do not go OOM anymore than any other mage in MC, but lead the damage charts among mages routinely. If I saw a lvl 60 Mage with this on their back and +30 spell damage, that would be ok (till they get something in MC like a SoD, Mageblade/Grimoire) and would a rockin combo to cover all schools.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Aug 23 09:05:18 2005</div>
