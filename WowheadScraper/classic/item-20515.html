Do this 4 times, yeilding 4 Medallions of Stations.\n\n4. Take 3 Medallion of Stations and 3 Twilight Cultists sets, and four other party members, and use them on Normal Windstones to summon Abyssal Dukes. Each Duke drops an Abyssal Signet. You should have 3 of these at the end of your summons.\n\n5.

I think you need to be revered to hand it in tho.<br /><br />~85 gold<br />5 major mana/health pots<br />5 major prot pots of all 5 classes<br />4 essence of air/water/fire<br />9 dense sharpening stones<br />and ummmm 5 arcane elixirs or something</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My guild has collected 4 of these scepters and everytime we turned them in we all got the Elemental attuned blade</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How many reputation with the Circle do you get for 1 Abyssal Scepter?<br /><br />And isn't the Quest repeatable with 3 Scepters like with the lower ones? (Even it would be really silly^^)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What you need to do?&nbsp; I've heard a handful of ways to get this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i copied this post from Killswitch1968 on another thread, it answers your question properly. (Disclamer) The credit for this post belongs solely to that mastermind freakshow.<br /><br />1. Farm Twilight Cultist humanoids in Silithus. You will need 16 complete twilight sets and 9 large brilliant shards to get the materials to summon the boss that drops this.<br /><br />2. Use 12 twilight cultist sets to summon 12 Templars from the Lesser Windstones. You may need another person's help, but the Templars are soloable. Each will drop an Abyssal Crests. You will have 12 crests at the end of your summons.<br /><br />3. If you are Friendly with Cenarion Circle, you will be able to trade in 3 abyssal crests + 1 large brilliant shard for a 'Twilight Medallion of Station'. Do this 4 times, yeilding 4 Medallions of Stations.<br /><br />4. Take 3 Medallion of Stations and 3 Twilight Cultists sets, and four other party members, and use them on Normal Windstones to summon Abyssal Dukes. Each Duke drops an Abyssal Signet. You should have 3 of these at the end of your summons.<br /><br />5. If you are revered with Cenarion Hold, you will be able to turn in the 3 Abyssal Signets + 5 Large Brilliant Shards for a &quot;Twilight Ring of Lordship&quot;. Take this ring, your last medallion, and your last twilight cultist set and use it on a Greater Windstone. You will have a 1/4 chance that High Marshal Whirlaxis will be summoned.&nbsp; If you fail to kill this boss you lose all the materials required to summon him.<br /><br />More information at Wowwiki.com .<br /><br />My one edit to Mr. Killswitchs post would be to let you know, this series of actions will spawn one of the Abyssal High Counsel at random. each has a different loot table, and the Abyssal scepter has an average of 30%ish drop. GL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>takes about 20 people to kill a royal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know if the reputation needed to hand in the scepters has changed from revered? Cause I first got the quest at revered and did it a few times (first time I only had to hand in one but the following times I had to hand in 3 at a time). I now traded the scepters to guildmates who are revered so we don't have to use 3 each time but even though they are revered they aren't getting to the quest...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>killed all of these 4 types with just group of 4<br />warrior(tank spec, zg-mc gear), rogue(pvp spec, zg-bwl gear), priest(bwl-aq40-naxx stuff +1000 healing, 75mp+ gear), paladin(healer, zg gear, +650 healing, 50mp+ gear). Havent used any flasks or so, just couple mana pots for healers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You only have to be honored to complete quest with abyssal scepter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've aquired 4 of theese so far. And still quite alot to go (The darned respawn time of the greater stones, and the people it need :P)<br /><br />I used the first one I got to get the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20602">Chest of Spoils</a>.. Contained 70g and alot of potions. <br /><br />But now I wonder, if the scepters, alike the signers and crests, are used for summoning anything further, at exalted perhaps? In the future maybe?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I believe the guild Nightmare Asylum has summoned the ultimate Silithus boss, and some of my guildies watched it (they have RL friends in NA). Supposedly it requires all the gear for the Lords of the Council and like 6 Abyssal Scepters. Any and all guilds that have summoned the ultimate boss are keeping quiet about it, and all I know about it is what I've said and the fact that he exists. There is a slight chance it may all be BS, but as far as I know there has been no reason to doubt its truth. Time will tell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I believe that there is such a boss, reading the short-story Blizzard made about the openning of AQ it said something about &quot;the abyssals and their masters&quot;, as the normal lords do not loot anything that would help create the scepter, then i gues that you would need to summon a greater being than that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just turned this in 2day on ursin, i got:<br />78g 80s<br />5xEvery Greater Protection Potion<br />5xGreater Mana Potion<br />5xGreater Health Potion<br />9xDense Sharpening Stones<br /><br />i geuss they nurfed the rewards, comparing to what other ppl have gotten, :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a drop of a boss, not a mat required to summon it. To summon it you need a ring of lordship (requires Revered with Cenarion Circle), a medallion of station, and a full twilight set.<br /><br />To get the ring, youll need 3 signets (dukes), and 5 large brilliant shards.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Feb 19 01:50:19 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>do you need to be revered or honored to dumon them</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am Revered with CH and have one of the Abyssal Scepters but I am unable to get the chest of spoils. I checked with the Tauren by the moonwell and it doesn't offer me the quest? I did have a guild mate make the ring to summon the Lord before I was revered. Could it it be that I have to make at least one ring on my own before I have the option to turn in the scepter for the chest of spoils? any comment appreciated</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What are those used for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Can you spawn him specifically? Or one of the four bosses will spawn randomly?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You think all guilds that have done it would keep quiet about it? Given the bragtastic nature of uberguilds atleast one of them would have said &quot;we were the first to do X&quot; for sure.</div>
