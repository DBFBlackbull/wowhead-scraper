This is about the same it took most people I have talked to. Some have grinded it out in 48 hour gaming marathon stretches. It really isn't hard. And, on my server, alliance lost 95% of the games.\n\nGetting the Gold -- I did this in a couple of days without a gathering talent, any gold in the bank, and without a guild. Grinded SM, grinded higher level humanoids, played the markets -- the last of which is how I made the vast majority of my money.\n\nAs many have stated, it really is an easy weapon to get. For PVP warriors or Paladins it really is a nice one. \n\nOn Price -- it is always 125 plus whatever silver.

If the force is unstoppable we must conclude that there is no \npossible way for it to change vectors or speed, and therefore a transferrance of energy \nis impossible and the law of conservation of momentum is meaningless.  If the object has \ninfinite mass then it must be infinitely large, and in an infinite universe the object \nwould be the universe itself, becasue the idea of movement outside the universe is \nmeaningless this would make absolute sense considering the object is immovable.  Nomrally, \nit would only be logical to assume that if one of these force\/objects exists, the other \ncannot exist becasue it would cancel the first out, but if we assume that they both exist \nwe must eventually ask ourselves what would happen if these two collided?  If the immovable \nobject is an entire universe we have to conclude that the unstoppable force does not exist \nin the same universe, so where does it exist?  According to the string theory, there are \nmultiple universes all connected by worm holes and are all intertwined like a cloth made of \nstring where the strings represent wormholes connecting every universe and dimention.  This \ntells us that the unstoppable force and the immovable object must exist in two different \ndimentions from each other, making it impossible for them to collide unless the unstoppable \nforce enters a worm hole to the dimention of the immovable object.  If the object does take \nup an entire universe and is in fact immovable, there is no possible way for the unstoppable \nforce to enter the universe unless it is finite and stoppable, and since it is infinite, \nthe only explanation is that the unstoppable force leaves one dimention into a worm hole \nand tries to enter the dimention of the immovable object and is ejected through another \nworm hole into a dimention exactly opposite of the immovable object, thus retaining its \ninfinite kinetic energy and vector, while the immovable object retains its status as having \ninfinite mass and size.  Conclusion: if the unstoppable force was to hit the immovable \nobject, this would result in the end of all universes and dimentions as we know it, because \nif contact was possible the force would lose its infinite energy and thus it would become \nfinite, and a finite energy cannot exist in an infinite universe but the unstoppable force \nwould have to keep traveling, therefore all universes that the force could possibly travel \nto (all of them) would become obsolete and disappear, resulting in the apocalypse","date":"2006-06-30T10:16:55-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"It's a logical contradiction, both can't exist\n\nIt's like having 2 men, both of whom are taller than the other","creationdate":"2006-06-30T13:21:07-05:00","id":1282588,"rating":0,"commentid":3073971,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"spudnic","importedSubject":"blizzard screwed them selves with this one"},{"body":"Well actualy i always thought that if they hit each other Chuck Norris died....","creationdate":"2006-07-06T17:05:47-05:00","id":1282585,"rating":0,"commentid":3073971,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Morldauf","importedSubject":"blizzard screwed them selves with this one"},{"body":"the immovable object breaks... it's imovable not unbreakable.","creationdate":"2006-07-10T21:30:48-05:00","id":1282589,"rating":0,"commentid":3073971,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"complexity","importedSubject":"blizzard screwed them selves with this one"},{"body":"No its not, as mentioned the Unstoppable force is unstoppable (asuming it lives up to its name ofc) while the Immovable object is simply unable to move or be moved (not very practical ability for a shield, u can buy it but u will have to stay still next to the vendor if u wish to use it...).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3118</b></h3>I would suggest every 2hander who wants to DPS to get this as a base item. It works all the way through MC and into BWL and is better than anything you'll find in 5 man zones. Since there are unlimited The Unstoppable Forces for sale, every class that can equip it and queue for AV can get one.<br /><br />You must be AV exalted.<br /><br />**If you're a warrior, can purchase this, and don't have a shield PLEASE buy <br />The Immovable Object<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19321">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19321</a><br /><br />It's a dandy shield for PvP and light PvE.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8491</b></h3>This weapon is very good for SoC pallys. Especially with the 2.0 patch, Ive been crit'ing for 1200-1300 and im only in teir 0. I also have the crusader enchant on it. I love this thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hansol</b></h3>Most druids favor this item because of the +str and +stam, the only thing druids cannot get from this is the Chance on hit: 1 Second stun, Only in moonkin and human form hitting with this weapon it would be able to stun. The chance to crit is also very nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9156</b></h3>This weapon is a perfect two hander for paladins who just reached 60. Its far from the best 2-handed mace a Pally could get but it proves very efficient both in combat and in its cost compared to other such items<br /><br />This weapon will especially help Paladins who have seal of command. With its slow attack speed it causes SoC to proc more per minute belive it or not than faster weapons. plus the 2% crit increase never hurts any class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tsarnkoth</b></h3>It's a good weapon to get while preparing to grind the honor for an HWL weapon: you can make 7000 honor in a single day on AV weekend, get it, and then spend a week or two grinding honor for the HWL gear. Damage is good, comparable to MC weapons, the stun combines well with warrior mace spec for PvP and it's a surprisingly underrated weapon for PvE grinding, especially on stunnable mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>11253</b></h3>Awesome PvP weapon, and its proc goes well with the warrior mace spec talent.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So i'm a 60 Orc warlock, and i have this Warrior at 1/4 health about 10 feet from me, i'm casting a shadowbolt, when nightfall procs, meaning 2 shadowbolts at once! .1 second away from the shadowbolts going off he Charges, i resist the charge stun (orc)! but the Weapon procs and stuns me, giving him enough time to execute me.<br /><br />The Unstoppable Force saves lives!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay, so here are some notes about this weapon.<br /><br />First, for Paladins that use SoC -- this is a profound weapon for that talent. I was doing good kill stats with Twig of the World Tree but this made it insane. I went from having to rely a lot on JoC... to kill shotting people with default white damage and SoC in no time. The crit bonus, extra dps, and slower speed really make a difference.<br /><br />AV Grinding -- this took me two weeks, playing &quot;casual&quot;, a few hours a night. This is about the same it took most people I have talked to. Some have grinded it out in 48 hour gaming marathon stretches. It really isn't hard. And, on my server, alliance lost 95% of the games.<br /><br />Getting the Gold -- I did this in a couple of days without a gathering talent, any gold in the bank, and without a guild. Grinded SM, grinded higher level humanoids, played the markets -- the last of which is how I made the vast majority of my money.<br /><br />As many have stated, it really is an easy weapon to get. For PVP warriors or Paladins it really is a nice one. <br /><br />On Price -- it is always 125 plus whatever silver. This is because of the Exalted price reduction bonus you get to all goods from the vendor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm on a new server - Aerie Peak, so having a weapon of this quality really shows.&nbsp; That being said, look at the stats, it is a sick weapon for any age of a server, especially until you get far into ZG and MC.<br /><br />At first I was leery about mace spec, since I lose so much crit going from IBS and polearm spec.&nbsp; But it is not a big deal.&nbsp; Plus, between mace spec and the proc here, it makes up for it (in PvP at least).&nbsp; Everyone hates stuns in PvP.&nbsp; If you stun someone with this, you will usually have time for another swing or maybe even an MS and a swing.&nbsp; I'll take that over a 5% more crit chance.<br /><br />Now, with the new rep, it is extremely easy to get exaulted versus before.&nbsp; Matches should take between 20 min - 2 hours max.&nbsp; Just make sure your team takes some objectives and kills some opposing facton.&nbsp; If you are winning quickly, you could possibly do it in one weekend.&nbsp; I managed in 2 weeks because horde mysteriously started destroying us, just like we did to them the previous week.&nbsp; If your side isn't doing well, do turnins, convince a small group to ninja towers/gys and whatever.&nbsp; Every point helps.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; Yeah, wait for double honor/rep weekend to really grind this rep.&nbsp; That will make all the difference.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This weapon looks like a pig's head xD</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What happens when The Unstoppable Force hits the shield called The Unmovable Object?<br /><br />Ill tell you<br /><br />A vortex opens up and swallows up the world.<br /><br />Please if you have this weapon dont fight anyone with that shield, for you shall be the death to us all<br /><br />And you wont get the honor for it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, even after a couple of patches later, even after aq20, aq40 and zul gurrub was introduced, there was TuF. It gets the job done. I've killed so many zin rok, untamed blade, and even smoked this ashkandi war twice, with a tuf in my hands. If you're a melee hit up av as soon as you can to get it. Once you get your tuf, upgrade all your armor slots before upgrading your weapon, you can get alot out of this with solid gear. Slap a crusader enchant on it, and see how high of an ms crit you can get with it :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>all weapon &quot;procs&quot; DO NOT word in feral forms, i have a 60 feral druid myself, and ive tested it. BUT, trinkets such as darkmoon card: maelstrom, and heroism, do proc in feral forms, ive found them to be also quite useful in bearform swipes, because it can proc off of each hit. so basically when your looking for a weapon as a feral druid, you just want to get weapons with nice stats, like crit and agility etc. the unstoppable force is still a very nice feral druid weapon, i use it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So as a Pally that loves +spell damage (I imagine Shammies can find themselves in this situation too), I was thinking of getting a +30 spell dmg on it. The point being, that while there is a great weapon for that, the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Fist%20of%20Cenarius">Fist of Cenarius</a>, the +2% spell crit really doesn't help me. As a pally I must resort to raw melee damage more often than shammies or caster druids, and the SoC proc is a physical attack, so +spell crit won't work there. The SoC hit will, however benefit from +spell damage making for a damage increase there and on the judgements (as well as holy shock and consecrations).<br /><br />So it's kind of a compromise, the crusader is nice and all, and +25 agility may add burst damage, but for PvP I use elemental sharpening stones. A TuF with +spell damage would kinda make it a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Grand%20Marshal's%20Demolisher">Grand Marshal's Demolisher</a> for kids, boosting my damage all round with consecration, holy shock, judgements, SoC hits and hammer of wrath.<br /><br />And before you say it, yes, SoC hits (not judgements) gain from +spell damage. What? The SoC hit does 70% weapon damage, and you never noticed your SoC hits making more holy than white damage on a target with less than 30% damage reduction?<br />Check:<br /><a href="http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=13021521&amp;sid=1" rel="nofollow">Spell Damage Coefficients</a><br /><br />So ... comments?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Execute has nothing to do with wep damage. Btw this mace rocks! 60 warrior, and i use it over OEB unless raiding, need that +8 swords for 63 elites</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well the weapon lasted me until lv 62-63 or something like that, the only thing comparable is hellreaver &quot;i think thats wut its called&quot; but it ne ver dropped for me, i would suggest getting a +9 wep damage on it and just wait for something to drop, i am a warrior btw , good luck on your desicion</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>That is what I call a GREAT warrior weapon, but shamans and palladins know how to handle it too ! I would like to see the knockback, I hope it's like the one the Ogres do in the Burning Steppes. Would be VERY cool if you are fighting on high grounds with this weapon, just knock them all the way down ! :D<br />I heard you could buy this weapon from the pvp vendor in Alteric when you get Exalted, but I cannot confirm nor deny it..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I am curious how big the 1.7 nerf on this will be as I only got it a few days ago. If the stun is on the same diminished returns timer as the warrior's or paladin's stuns, then this weapon will be disenchant material. I hope it isn't the case though, but I expect the worse from Blizzard. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well now its stoppable force lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Alright...I am trying to get exalted every day pretty much and i am only honored to show for it. I was wondering about how long does it take to get Exalted with Stormpike?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>How long obviuosly depends on how much u play per day. Every time u win AV, I would guess u get around 1200 rep. Once u get revered (forget how much rep for it), exhaulted is another 21,000 rep. So, doing the math, once you hit revered, it will take an additional 20 runs of AV assuming you win everyone. <br /><br />I finally got exhaulted and picked up this bad boy last night. It rocks. Unfortunately, I had 3,000 rep to go when 1.10 was installed. Took me 2 weeks after that to gt the last 3,000. Man was I pissed. As hoard, we used to always win AV. After 1.10, we rarely won.<br /><br />Couple of clues, turn in all the drops you can. GL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was just staring at the ugly graphic (Great mace, $%^&amp;ty graphic), and I noticed something that more or less ruined the weapon entirely for me...<br /><br />Is it supposed to look like a wild boar? X_X (Pig with tusks for the slower kids.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Instead of arguing about what class should use this weapon, I would actually like to know something. Does the chance to stun for 1 second stack with specializing in two-handed maces for warriors? So would it have a 5% chance to stun for 3 seconds from the spec, and then a chance on hit to stun for 1 second from the weapon? If so, this would definitly own some people. Plus the 2% extra crit chance makes up a bit for what you lose going spec'd in axes or polearms. 7000 rep till exalted =) beware alliance casters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well considering that it takes alliance players 3X the number of runs to get this I think maybe we should get our own 3X damage multiplier.<br /><br />Other than that this should match the best maces in the game as far as burst damage.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Warriors, there is no way you should take OEB over TUF for pvp.... the stun = win vs casters. Also, at this moment swordspec is bugged and doesn't work on instant attacks. (it never procs on overpower/mortal strike.) For the rest, the slower weap speed gives higher instant attack dmg. (yes I know the multiplier is nerfed and it'll use 3.4 standard for 2handers.) But it has something to do with the topdamage times bla bla times dps times 3.4 or summin.<br /><br />Anyways, TuF &gt; Obsidian edged blade. Maybe if Swordspec get's fixed Obsidian edged blade might be close to a match and discutable. but all of ya people go for tuf now imo.<br /><br />This was for all the lollorz I think I can pvp and oeb rox people. :)<br /><br />Edited, Sat Feb 11 05:28:57 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What happens if The Unstoppable Force hits the Immovable Object? <br /><br />Assuming both of these are possible, we must also assume that the universe is infinite, <br />and we must assume the unstoppable force has infinite kinetic energy and the immovable <br />object has infinite mass. If the force is unstoppable we must conclude that there is no <br />possible way for it to change vectors or speed, and therefore a transferrance of energy <br />is impossible and the law of conservation of momentum is meaningless. If the object has <br />infinite mass then it must be infinitely large, and in an infinite universe the object <br />would be the universe itself, becasue the idea of movement outside the universe is <br />meaningless this would make absolute sense considering the object is immovable. Nomrally, <br />it would only be logical to assume that if one of these force/objects exists, the other <br />cannot exist becasue it would cancel the first out, but if we assume that they both exist <br />we must eventually ask ourselves what would happen if these two collided? If the immovable <br />object is an entire universe we have to conclude that the unstoppable force does not exist <br />in the same universe, so where does it exist? According to the string theory, there are <br />multiple universes all connected by worm holes and are all intertwined like a cloth made of <br />string where the strings represent wormholes connecting every universe and dimention. This <br />tells us that the unstoppable force and the immovable object must exist in two different <br />dimentions from each other, making it impossible for them to collide unless the unstoppable <br />force enters a worm hole to the dimention of the immovable object. If the object does take <br />up an entire universe and is in fact immovable, there is no possible way for the unstoppable <br />force to enter the universe unless it is finite and stoppable, and since it is infinite, <br />the only explanation is that the unstoppable force leaves one dimention into a worm hole <br />and tries to enter the dimention of the immovable object and is ejected through another <br />worm hole into a dimention exactly opposite of the immovable object, thus retaining its <br />infinite kinetic energy and vector, while the immovable object retains its status as having <br />infinite mass and size. Conclusion: if the unstoppable force was to hit the immovable <br />object, this would result in the end of all universes and dimentions as we know it, because <br />if contact was possible the force would lose its infinite energy and thus it would become <br />finite, and a finite energy cannot exist in an infinite universe but the unstoppable force <br />would have to keep traveling, therefore all universes that the force could possibly travel <br />to (all of them) would become obsolete and disappear, resulting in the apocalypse</div>

The weapon damage is very similar, only 20 more with this or so... The proc seems broken cause it doesnt work in PvE, so dunno if it works as it should in PvP either... The strength is 19, the &quot;strength&quot; on AR is 32, so that gets AR a little bit closer to TUFs damage. This one has 2 more stamina.. Yay...<br />So what you're doing, is playing 100+ hours in the most boring PvP zone ever, for 2% more crit, 20 more hp, and 20-25 more weapon damage.<br /><br />Not saying its bad, it isnt..
