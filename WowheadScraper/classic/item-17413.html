Right-click on the book and it teaches the spell:  Prayer of Fortitude.\n\n[b]What's That?[\/b]\nPrayer of Fortitude is a 'group' version of Power Word: Fortitude that increases Stamina by 43 for 60 minutes on all party members and pets in one shot. Party members must be within range to receive the buff--they must be close enough for you to cast the buff on them.  It lasts for one hour.\n\n[b]How much does it buff?[\/b]\nUnaltered, level 1 of this spell (available at lvl 48) increases stamina by 43.  It is equivalent to PW:F at this same level, but without having to individually cast PW:F on each party member.\nIt can be augmented by the Talent:  Improved PW:F  which increases the 'fortification' by +15% and +30%, with 1 or 2 points in this talent.\n\n[b]What else is required?[\/b]\nIt requires a Holy Candle as a reagent. It uses one Candle per cast, not per party member. \nHoly Candles can be purchased from a Reagent or Arcane Goods Vendor for 7s (less if you are Honored with that faction and\/or Sgt. or higher PvP rank), and stacks up to 20.  \n\n[b]How much mana does it use?[\/b]\nIt costs (unaltered) 2600 mana. \n[b]Golly, that uses a lot of mana![\/b]\nEven with the great mana cost, it is much more mana efficient to cast this spell once than to individually buff each party member and pets when grouping, plus it lasts twice as long as the Power Word: Fortitude.\n[b]Can it get cheaper (mana-wise)?[\/b]\nThe Talent: Mental Agility--maxed at 5 talent points, can reduce the cost by 10%.  If you learn the Talent:  Inner Focus, you can cast this spell for free.  \n\n[b]Where do I get this book?[\/b]\nThis book drops from some of the higher level instances--apparently fairly frequently, although probably not frequent enough if you are actually looking for it to drop.  Your best bet at finding it would be at the Auction House.  Hopefully someone won it as a drop and will sell for less than a ridiculous amount of gold.  It just depends on the market of your particular server.  Patience and persistence in this case can save you a stack of coin.\n\n[b]Other info[\/b]\nPrayer of Fortitude can only be cast on party members.  If you are in a Raid Group, you must cast on at least one member of each party in the group.  So, for a 40-man Raid Group, it would have to be cast 8 times to cover everyone.  Just make sure to target one member of each party in the Raid Group and cast.\n(Hopefully this task could be carried out by more than a single Priest.)\nIf you are in a regular group, you do not have to target any member to cast this spell (If you have 'self cast' enabled in the Interface Options menu.) If you want to cast on a party in your Raid Group, target one member from that party to buff the whole party.\n\n[b]What's next?[\/b]\nAt level 60 a Priest can use the book Codex: Prayer of Fortitude II (which is the group version of the level 60 PW:F and requires a Sacred Candle as a Reagent--which can also be purchased from a Reagent or Arcane Goods Vendor.\n\nThere are other Codecies in the game, but for information on those, you will have to do the research yourself.\n\nHappy Party Buffing!\n\n[i][small]Edited, Dec  5th 2006 11:44pm by stevenator for spelling and clarity (hopefully)[\/small][\/i]\n\n[i][small]Edited, Dec  6th 2006 12:04am by stevenator[\/small][\/i]","date":"2006-12-06T03:16:53-06:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"stevenator","importedSubject":"The Lowdown"}];

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>got hers in ST at level 45.&nbsp; It was fun racing to level to learn it.&nbsp; Hooray for Emerald Dream server - they are extremely expensive last I checked because it's a new server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i saw this on AH for 1.80g, and i thought.. &quot;whoa... this much be worth more&quot; and i check here, and see you buy it for LOTS.... tho im only lvl 38 ATM i bought it :P<br /><br />GL finding it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Sorry... I'm a little confused by something...so this buffs your whole group right?&nbsp; When in a raid group, like at AB or somwehere does it work for the entire raid group?&nbsp; Or do u have to buff individual members who aren't in your part of the raid?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Both codexs go for 5g max on my server (Durotan) ,lol. I wouldn't try to farm this ..just go buy it<br /><br />(BTW drops more in BRD than ST if you want to try..)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got mine for 1g in a 1g bid/3g buy out :D<br /><br />Amazing spell, just need 13k exp to use it eheh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Was Farming Dark Iron Residue and got two books in about 10 min time hahaha and there is a nice chance to get it! Im a lucky bastard!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bought mine on Black Dragonflight for 1g, the guy was gonna vendor a bunch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This dropped during ST and i was not allowed to roll need for it as it was unfair to other players. I ignored them and rolled need anyway and they booted me. Like wtf its for a priest im a priest and <br />I dont see anyone else using it and i was the only priest in the party.&nbsp; Besides it sells for a gold ffs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it's probably more expensive now that people are running Onyxia and BRS less (pretty much not at all in the case of Onyxia), and supply is therefore limited. I'd been looking for a week or so without any success on Lothar Horde-side, wound up buying the first one I came across (15g -- price gouging, but whatever, I'm rich).<br /><br />of course, on other servers, it may be just as cheap now, I have no idea. just an educated guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well it's pretty dropped at blackrock depths</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone whom has a priest in there group and rolls on this is possible the most selfish and rude person. The drop rate is horrible on these things and Ive been through the instance quite a few times and seen it taken by a rogue and a warrior over the priest in both groups.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well the lv60 PW:F effect is better than the prayer... sure, it takes less mana to use but I think the lv60 PW:F might be essential for group survival in high lv instances and PvP?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Found in Sunken Temple elite non boss mob dropped</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just had to say something. I am a 50th lvl Priest on the server Medivh. I went to the AH to buy this spell and somebody had it for sale, but it was 40g. That is crazy. It would be different if people didn't expect you to always give them a fort buff, but they do. Why make an outrageous price on something that is beneficial to all. Needless to say i found it later, but still had to pay 18g for it. Just makes me sad. Not whining or anything just thought I would try to let someone know that....if you are trying to make some gold please remember this is beneficial to all...not just the priest so please don't price it through the roof.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What I'm wondering is if the level 60 prayer of fortitude spell requires this lower level one. If it does then I will buy this one, otherwise no.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok we got the whole &quot;ah bargin hunt&quot; argument in the first 50 boast posts. Now can anyone please explain the spell to me as I now have it after it dropped in sunken temple, and does it also now become apart of your talents? ie: does it improve when you buy training if you are a shadow priest? And most important where do you get the candles from? If anyone can help with this it would be so very much appreciated!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I bought it for 50 G and sold it for 110 G.<br /><br />I &lt;3 the AH. ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I personally saw this on AH a lot on Kor'gall(eu) horde side, but on Lightning's blade(eu) horde side I never see it. Might have to get a grind party together for ST so I can get it :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does the improved PW:F talent also improve PoF?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Has anyone noticed if this spell drops more in a certain instance or by certain mobs? I have been through ST, BRD, UBRS, LBRS, Scholo, and Strat and have yet to see this drop once. If someone happens to get an extra of this on the Doomhammer server, would be very interested in taking it off your hands for a reasonable price.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The drop rate on this is pretty awful, but it prolly drops enough so every priest who can use it can get a copy. Not all that hard to find, just check the AH, not worth wasting time farming for when its usually only 15g or so.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What does the spell do?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Bought it for 15g (bid, short time left) on AH, much better than the 65g I saw just hours before.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><b>What is Codex: Prayer of Fortitude?</b><br />It is a book usable by Priests at least level 48. Right-click on the book and it teaches the spell: Prayer of Fortitude.<br /><br /><b>What's That?</b><br />Prayer of Fortitude is a 'group' version of Power Word: Fortitude that increases Stamina by 43 for 60 minutes on all party members and pets in one shot. Party members must be within range to receive the buff--they must be close enough for you to cast the buff on them. It lasts for one hour.<br /><br /><b>How much does it buff?</b><br />Unaltered, level 1 of this spell (available at lvl 48) increases stamina by 43. It is equivalent to PW:F at this same level, but without having to individually cast PW:F on each party member.<br />It can be augmented by the Talent: Improved PW:F which increases the 'fortification' by +15% and +30%, with 1 or 2 points in this talent.<br /><br /><b>What else is required?</b><br />It requires a Holy Candle as a reagent. It uses one Candle per cast, not per party member. <br />Holy Candles can be purchased from a Reagent or Arcane Goods Vendor for 7s (less if you are Honored with that faction and/or Sgt. or higher PvP rank), and stacks up to 20. <br /><br /><b>How much mana does it use?</b><br />It costs (unaltered) 2600 mana. <br /><b>Golly, that uses a lot of mana!</b><br />Even with the great mana cost, it is much more mana efficient to cast this spell once than to individually buff each party member and pets when grouping, plus it lasts twice as long as the Power Word: Fortitude.<br /><b>Can it get cheaper (mana-wise)?</b><br />The Talent: Mental Agility--maxed at 5 talent points, can reduce the cost by 10%. If you learn the Talent: Inner Focus, you can cast this spell for free. <br /><br /><b>Where do I get this book?</b><br />This book drops from some of the higher level instances--apparently fairly frequently, although probably not frequent enough if you are actually looking for it to drop. Your best bet at finding it would be at the Auction House. Hopefully someone won it as a drop and will sell for less than a ridiculous amount of gold. It just depends on the market of your particular server. Patience and persistence in this case can save you a stack of coin.<br /><br /><b>Other info</b><br />Prayer of Fortitude can only be cast on party members. If you are in a Raid Group, you must cast on at least one member of each party in the group. So, for a 40-man Raid Group, it would have to be cast 8 times to cover everyone. Just make sure to target one member of each party in the Raid Group and cast.<br />(Hopefully this task could be carried out by more than a single Priest.)<br />If you are in a regular group, you do not have to target any member to cast this spell (If you have 'self cast' enabled in the Interface Options menu.) If you want to cast on a party in your Raid Group, target one member from that party to buff the whole party.<br /><br /><b>What's next?</b><br />At level 60 a Priest can use the book Codex: Prayer of Fortitude II (which is the group version of the level 60 PW:F and requires a Sacred Candle as a Reagent--which can also be purchased from a Reagent or Arcane Goods Vendor.<br /><br />There are other Codecies in the game, but for information on those, you will have to do the research yourself.<br /><br />Happy Party Buffing!<br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 5th 2006 11:44pm by stevenator for spelling and clarity (hopefully)</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, Dec 6th 2006 12:04am by stevenator</i></div>
