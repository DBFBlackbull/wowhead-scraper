If you want to spare yourself time and frustration, farm the cash instead and try your luck at the Auction House. <br /><br />:-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mikezila</b></h3>Does this sell well at the neutral auction house? Would be hard for alliance to farm one. Same goes for the fish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8378</b></h3>Ive recieved 2 in a week this recipe is all to make an item in the game made for pure fun. It sells alot becuase its a super rare drop but once you get it you can actually sell the delights seperately. The fish can be fished in Wailing Caverns, i usually fish for them at the pool right before the portal to enter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8661</b></h3>Well here's fun thing, and anyone with two accounts can do this, but farm it on your hordie while you level it, sell it to your alliance alt, slap it up for an ungodly price. <br /><br />It's kind of stupid though. Once on my hordie I bought out like 5 of them for 50s on Horde AH. I tranfered them to my husband's character and then sold the recipe to the Alliance for 15-20g each. Quite the tidy profit. It's all too easy to profit off of lazy people who don't want to go farm it themselves.<br /><br />Do your self a favor, go farm it up yourself and don't get ripped off lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8900</b></h3>This isn't impossible to find, I've had two drop before level 20. If your not planning on doing cooking, it will make big bucks in the Auction House.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8271</b></h3>This item is a rare drop that drops anywhere near an oasis. If you have cooking skill of 85 you will surely love this. If alliance finding this is RARE! This sells for about 2 gold peices per stack. Horde usually goes around 1g per stack. Grinding in the barrens is a great way to get these, even you didnt even want the. You can sell them in AH for a roughly 5-7g on my server and they will buy instantly.<br />I hope my information was helpfull.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>3996</b></h3>One of the best ways to get this item as Alliance is to watch the neutral Auction Houses. Horde who have farmed the recipe (or, more likely, just got it randomly) sometimes sell it in the neutral houses.<br /><br />For the horde, this recipe sells for a pretty high price.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>17690</b></h3>This recipe turns gray at 165.<br /><br />I think it took me about 300 fish to go from cooking 85 to 165.<br /><br />160 - took 8 fish<br />161 - took 12 fish<br />162 - took 16 fish<br />163 - took 20 fish<br />164 - took 28 fish<br />165 - took 48 fish<br /><br />While not the shortest route to leveling cooking, this is in constant demand, and is typically a profitable transaction if the Deviate Fish is purchased at a reasonable price.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pegea</b></h3>On a whim some guildies and I decided to try and get a recipe since one of us had maxed cooking. We flew to Ratchet then went south and nuked pirates. The recipe dropped 10 minutes later, total of maybe 100-120 pirates killed, guess we got lucky!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Avengrauth</b></h3>Farming this item is pretty much the only option for Alliance on my server. The common price now is between 75 and 100g on the AH.<br /><br />I, however, am very surprised at the comments here, finding three in one day, 10 minutes of farming and a drop. I have not been so lucky, counting tonight I have been farming for 5 days and no luck. Not 5 days straight, no sleep... then I would be mad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>47022</b></h3>Farmed mine off of the harpies in the north; they have a very fast respawn rate so no down time. Took me an afternoon, and probably 300+ kills, but it did finally drop. Great way to farm linen for an alt, incidentally.<br /><br />Another option would be to farm the Southsea pirates just south of Ratchet. They respawn even faster than the harpies, and you have the potential to earn goblin rep per kill as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zoom13</b></h3>When I decided to grind me some off those I got one on the first kill ;)<br /><br />And 15 min later I got one more. <br /><br />Sold them for 70g each so 140g in 25min is not so bad ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's a random drop in the barrens.<br /><br />The .6% chance to drop from Muck Frenzys is because it shows as only 172 have been killed. Basically anything in the zone has the same chance of dropping it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am currently doing quests in the Barrens (level 16) and, while hunting, I got this recipe. I planned on selling it at the AH for 5s or something like that since it seemed useless, but I went to Mulgore before going to Orgrimmar, and, there, I started fishing and cooking. When both skills were at 100, I thought I might as well use the Savory Deviate Delight recipe. I'm glad I didn't sell it. ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Personally, I found that the best place for grinding for this was the pig-man village near the Crossroads. Lots of low-level pigs in a relatively small area. Fast respawn time - by the time I had cleared out one part of the village, pigs had respawned in the other. Other usable stuff from the pigs - linen cloth and low-level green items.<br /><br />Must have spent some 6-7 hours looking for this recipe until it finally dropped from a Bristleback Thornweaver.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hello. I think i have something interesting to add to this discussion.<br /><br />I collect cooking recipes and I'm going to collect as many as i can.<br /><i>I want 'em all</i>!<br /><br />As i just turned lvl 47, i found out about this recipe and decided to find the recipe on my own since i didn't have a lot of money to buy it from AH.<br /><br />After some time of grinding all around the barrens i got more and more eager to find it and my pride stopped me from buying it at AH. My search continued and after a period of <b>at least a month</b>, with &quot;/played <i>this level</i>&quot; (lvl 47) of <b>2 days 4 hours and 40 minutes</b> (!) i finally found it...<br /><br />Now, the time above is quite accurate since the first thing i did turning 47 was to start looking, and the only time i spent out of barrens was at IF to sell the stuff i found, and to buy arrows. (I'm a hunter).<br /><br />I would <u>not</u> recomend anyone to look for it. I nearly stopped playing WoW because of not ever finding it. I'm happy i finally did.<br /><br />It's definitely worth the money it sells for at AH. If I would have spent the same amount of time in an instance that i spent looking for it i would have collected gold enough to buy multiple recipes now...<br /><br />Anyway, if you decide to look for it on your own;<br />Prepare for the worst, don't give up, and <i>Good luck</i>!<br /><br />/Leoin, <i>Nightelf hunter - Stormscale</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those of you who are selling the actual recipe, DON'T. I'd only sell the recipe if I'd already learned it before. The recipe goes for about 30g-100g easily, but if you learn it and sell the FISH it makes, you could make about 1000g in a matter of days of pure farming. Here's what you do:<br /><br />1). Farm Plainstriders and Zhevra for the Recipe, since it seems that they have the best drop.<br />2) Learn Cooking and Fishing. Farm wolves in Silverpine or Swoops in Mulgore for Wolf Meat/Small Eggs to cook to up Cooking to 85, then learn this. Fish in Orgrimmar until level 50<br />3) Go to the Lushwater Oasis (Wailing Caverns Oasis) and farm there for Deviate Fishes, since that place has the best drops.<br />4) Cook Deviate Fishes, sell a stack of them for whatever your server price is going for, and then some.<br />5) Rinse and repeat steps 3 and 4.<br />6) Be massivly rich in a matter of days and buy your epic mount with ease.<br />7) Laugh because your guildees are poor while your raking in 1000g a week, and then some.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Eating a deviate fish will have a random effect on your character. Possible effects include:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Healthy Spirit - increases your character's spirit by 5 points for 30 minutes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Invigorate - instantly heals your character for about 450 points.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Party Time! - a debuff that causes the character to perform random emotes for 2 minutes. Your character will /clap, /cheer, /chicken, /lol, or /dance every 10-15 seconds, possibly interrupting spells or other actions.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Rejuvenation - rank 4 of the druid buff by the same name, heals your character by 45 points every 3 seconds for 12 seconds.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Shrink - a debuff that reduces your character's apparent size, as well as their strength and stamina, for 2 minutes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Sleepy - a debuff that stuns your character for 30 seconds. You cannot perform any actions while stunned.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Eating a savory deviate delight will also have a random effect on your character, but the effects are different from those caused by the raw fish. Possible effects include:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Flip Out - a buff that turns your character into a ninja for 60 minutes. A ninja in this case is a human dressed entirely in black with a black bandana across its face.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Yaaarrrr - a buff that turns your character into a pirate for 60 minutes. A pirate in this case is a human dressed in pirate's clothing. <br /><br />If you are a Druid or Shaman, you will lose these effects when you change forms. Priests also lose the effect when using Shadowform.<br /><br />Note that certain emotes change when you are under Flip Out or Yaaarrrr. For example, /cry, /laugh, /cheer, /chicken, /yawn, /train, /silly and /sigh all sound like the human versions.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
