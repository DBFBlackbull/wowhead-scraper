To access this, you need to go into the cave. The cave mouth can be seen in the map of the Damaged Chest, to the southeast of where the chest is located (the chest is basically inside the mountain)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hampst0r</b></h3>to clarify, turn right and follow the loop and you'll find the chest.<br />Its a little brown box rather than a tresure chest looking one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item is technically actually in Thousand Needles.&nbsp; At the Galak Centaur camp along the north wall of the zone, there's a cave opening.&nbsp; Deep into this cave, which has a LOT of relatively quickly respawning centaurs, there's eventually a Damaged Chest, which has the Tattered Manuscript within it.<br /><br />This is an evil, evil quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Soon as you enter the cave take the first right and keep going till you reach the part that overlooks the room with the pool. You'll find the Damaged Chest there. It is NOT the Solid Chest that you find. Expect horde to be in the cave or around the area. Did this at level 31 with a couple of tries getting to the cave and looking for the chest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just did this quest at lv30 and it was one of the most exciting times I've had in the game yet! It started with me running through the great lift.&nbsp; If you time it correctly you can jump on the lift just as the tauren notices you. Bye, bye! Moooo! If you die, the graveyard is just at the bottom anyway. <br /><br />Stay on the road till freewind post and then head north. Sneak through the centaur camp, taking on one mob at a time and it's easy enough. I used my voidwalker. Konkrit did an amazing job! Cast soulstone res on yourself obviously (luckily I didn't need it) and take your time. The rush when you find the chest is great! Thanks for the instructions guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I don't know about you guys but finding the tattered was quiet simple, as u enter, go via right till u reach a small pond, and its right across it, it the damaged chest...<br /><br />But overall, this was one easy quest, lvl 30 warlock and i used succubus</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i had some fun with this quest although lots of walking definitly worth it. i actually met up with a 33 undead warlock who killed me at first but then after i rezd and didnt attack him i guess he realised that we were doin the same quest. But anyway definitly an easy quest as far as the cave goes you can solo it at 30. its on you rfirst right, across the stream and then a little to your left, careful though its a brown box and kinda hard to see.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest is a cinch.&nbsp; I did at at level 31, but I'm sure it would have made no difference if I was level 30.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can mow down the entire camp if you wish, the centaurs are wimpy (great source of silk too).&nbsp; <br /><br />Inside the cave just take it easy and cautiously, never run into a fight with half you life left and try to only aggro one at a time.&nbsp; Actually locating the chest within the cave is probably the hardest part of the quest.&nbsp; Use the Eye of Kilrogg to scout inside first.<br /><br />Even with the Eye, it still took me forever to spot the chest.&nbsp; I must've run by it a dozen times before I finally noticed it.&nbsp; So I took a screenshot to save everyone else the pain that I went through: <a href="http://evula.org/madfax7/misc/images/warlockdamagedchest.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://evula.org/madfax7/misc/images/warlockdamagedchest.jpg</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is in the cave like u say well hidden and a lot of fighting to get it thanks. Tell others not to bother with the false leads given as to the E'Thock camp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you have been playing horde until lvl 10, this cave is basically the same layout as the first cave you enter as horde. And I have sen similar layouts in the Alliance side at lvl 13 as a gnome. Aint hard to find the chest, if you keep your eyes open. Aint hard to get it. At least with the mobs, the worse thing might be the Horde players. The mobs is just take one by one method. It will work out great then. It isnt heavily guarded luckily, and the mobs are lvl 25-29.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I solo'ed this no problem as a lvl 30 Human Warlock.&nbsp; Used my Succubus.&nbsp; None of the centaurs were grouped.&nbsp; If you stay to the right, once you pass over (through) the stream, theres a little passage to the left, with a little window.&nbsp; It's in there.&nbsp; If you're in the room that looks over the pool, and you're on the ledge above it, you've gone too far.<br /><br />Good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>43:33 i find the 2 chest open all<br />realy easy quest:-))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yup the thing is in 43 33 its a chest it took me a wild but its easey</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did this PvE, solo, after coming off the great lift, it took no more than 10 minutes. There were other peeps in the cave killing centaurs, so I basically walked right up to the chest. took about 5 minutes. <br /><br />Either they made this quest easier, or the some of the &quot;OMG this is a hard quest!&quot; comments above are way overblown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the mobbs are like lvl 25 -.-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;the easy way of doing it is to run ---&gt; die ----&gt; res, over and over again xD, i mean lol, the mobs are lvl 26 and cant take more then 3 hits... its really easy quest, you dont have to go and die, just if u find the chest, thats the only problem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it is at 43:32 not 43:33 hope this help and the screen shot was a life saver</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The screenshot was a lifesaver.&nbsp; Took me 30 mins trying to find the darn thing, and I walked past it 5 times.<br /><br />If Thalanaar isn't directly on the way if you go via the elevators (I dunno; I was a moron and went through Desolace/Feralas), make sure you find it and grab the flight path.&nbsp; If you're planning on levelling tailoring, grab the Azure Blue Silk Cloak pattern at Thalanaar, too =)<br /><br />The centaurs were easy for me (all green), only downtime was to loot, but I'm affliction specced, level 32, PvE server, using my succubus, pulling one at a time and drain tanking.&nbsp; I could easily handle 2 adds tho.<br /><br />If you're PvP, I suggest you bring buddies and study the screenshot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was trying to do this today, and you guys just CONFUSED me. This is where it is at (in 1K Needles):<br /><br /><a href="http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/4345/shoc5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/4345/shoc5.jpg</a><br /><br />When you get into that cave, the centaurs respawn FAST. I recommend getting in as far as you can and dying. Then, find the chest when you're dead (so you know where you're going and don't die again). To find it,&nbsp; stay to the right and hop over a little stream. You'll see a solid chest. To the left of that, there are a few more centaurs and a smaller, <b>damaged</b> chest. That's the one you want! I tried taking a screenshot of where it's at. I suggest that you rez as close to the chest as possible, but in a safe spot. (to summon your voidwalker).<br /><br /><a href="http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/9413/manuyc4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/9413/manuyc4.jpg</a><br /><br />I summoned my voidwalker, had him tank the centaurs near the chest while I opened it, and got the manuscript.&nbsp; Hope this helps a little bit. As for the tome? Well, that's another adventure that I've yet to embark on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>all you have to do is use your voidie as a tank and you can take 3-4 of these centaurs at once. this was simple.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The killing was easy. With my loyal Voidwalker tanking the lvl 27 mobs were easy. But finding the chest was a lot harder. Thanks to someone's screenshot here on Thott I finally managed to locate it. Respawn is very quick in that cave, so i think i killed every mob there at least 4x before I had the chest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Thanks for all the pictures guys you made this REALLY easy for a level 30 lock *undead* using Void.<br /><br />Even helped out a human find the chest. ^.^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I really cant believe so many ppl are saying run and die? or bring a high level buddy? thats just mental i just did it on my own and there was no one else around killing, didnt even nearly die once ... i dont understand how ppl find it so hard? im only lvl 30 and wouldnt say im an awesome player at all.&nbsp; Very easy imo, only thing that took time for me was finding the damn place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Getting past the murlocs for the other half of the tome was much harder. I marked the chest at lvl 29 doing another quest in the same cave. When I got the tome quest I knew exactly where those missing pages had to be.<br /><br />Just go slow, aggro one centaur at a time and let the Voidwalker take his beatings like a good boy while you DOT away.<br /><br />It's helpful to use Curse of Recklessness when the centaurs get low on health. Keeps them from running and calling their friends. Or try to time a Shadowbolt so it pops them just before they run.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Here is a screenshot of the exact location. Follow the right side of the cave to the waterfall.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There are no stupid elites around it or on the way there. Simply go to the Centaur camp and enter the cave. It is all the way in the back of the cave. If you go in the cave, stay to the right and you will eventually get to it with no problem. When you come across a regular chest, you are very close. 2 more kills and you are home free!</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
