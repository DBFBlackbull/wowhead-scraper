It is NOT a rare drop or anything like that, it is sold to you by Rivern when you hit Exalted. You can only gain faction by doing the quests he offers.\nYou get the three quests at certain faction levels. The first at Neutral, the second at half way to Friendly, and the third at half way to Honored.\nYou must do the first quest 30 times to get half way through Neutral to get the second quest.\nIf you use a Reputation mod, you will see that amount of reputation goes Neutral&nbsp; -> Friendly (3000) -> Honored (6000) -> Revered (12000) -> Exalted (21000). In total, that is 42,000 reputation needed and each quest gives 50 reputation. Do the math, that's 840 quest turn-ins to reach Exalted. (Humans with the 10% faction bonus will need to do this 840-84 times, or 756).\n\nThe first quest is based on a 20% drop rate of quest items and may take someone 45 minutes to an hour to this quest once. The second quest is based on killing a set number of mobs in Winterfall Village. The third quest is also based on killing a set number of mobs, but they are extremely hard Elite Giants and they are located on the other side of the map in Frostwhisper Gorge.\n\nAll three quests give the same amount of reputation and the second one is by far the fastest, so you can decide which one to repeat. Assuming the quest takes you about 15 minutes to complete (including&nbsp; going back and forth to drop it off), it would take you a total of 210 real hours to do the quest 840 times. That is about nine days by itself, and seeing as how no one can play for nine days continuously doing this, it will take you months to get it (personally it took me a&nbsp; little over 2 months doing it every single day).\n\nYes you also have to learn the Tiger Riding ability from Darnassus to ride this mount, Rivern does not teach it to you. That means if you're not Night Elf, you have to get Exalted with Darnassus before you can purchase and learn Tiger Riding.\n\nThe mount was not given any armor or anything extra in the patch and still looks completely unique as compared to the other Night Elf mounts.\n\nYou can only do each quest once before having to turn it in to get it again. You cannot collect an abundance of meats or kill a lot of mobs and get multiple quest credits at once.\n\nAnd finally, here's a pic so you can see how it looks:\n[url=http:\/\/marvel.poned.com\/World%20of%20Warcarft\/ReinsOfTheWinterspringFrost.jpg]http:\/\/marvel.poned.com\/World%20of%20Warcarft\/ReinsOfTheWinterspringFrost.jpg[\/url]\n(deliberately not linked in img since it is a big picture)","date":"2005-08-02T17:02:47-05:00","rating":84,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Marvel32x2","importedSubject":"Just got this mount"},{"commentv2":1,"number":8,"id":2710927,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Human reputation boost is 10%. \n\n50 + (50 x .1) = 55\n\nYou start at neutral (0) and halfway through neutral (1500) you can unlock the second quest.\n\n55 x 28 = 1540.\n\nI did this first quest as fast as 18 minutes, and as slow as 35 minutes. It mainly depends on the drop rate. Given that I�m going to take my lowest and highest and come up with a mean (average). (18 + 35) \/ 2 = 26.5 minutes\n\n26.5 x 28 = 12.366\n\nNow this is an estimate because you can�t be sure how often it will drop, and if horde will gank you or not. So it�s a little over 12 hours to get the second quest, not so bad when you think about it.\n\nNow that you have unlocked the second quest, Winterfall Intrusion, it�s all about grinding from then on. Kill 5 shamans and 5 ursas, and based from what everyone says it takes about 15 minutes to get the quest, ride over, complete the quest, ride back, turn in. so that is 4 quests per hour. \n\n55 x 4 = 210. \n\nThat�s 210 reputation per hour. Now suppose you did this 4 hours a day.\n\n210 x 4 = 840\n\nThat�s 840 reputation a day, 5880 a week.\n\nNow, how long till you�re finally reached exalted? Well let�s find out!\n\nStarting at 0 to open the second quest and gain 1540 reputation, it took 12.366 hours approximately. Now if you�re going to do it 4 hours a day EVERY day (this is not including the days you started the first quest, this is just including the days that you�ve been working on Winterfall Intrusion), then on the 49th day you will be exalted.\n\nHow many hours of game play? Well it takes 4 hours to get 840 reputation, and 49 days of 4 hours of game play doing solely these quests.\n\n4 x 49 = 196\n\nAnd with the initial 12.366 hours it will take you 208.366 hours under IDEAL conditions. This means you weren�t killed once, you haven�t emptied your bags, you haven�t repaired, etc. I suggest you empty your bags before you start. Empty them after you�re done and repair after you�re done. And mainly ask yourself if you�re ready to devote 210 hours of your life to a mount. If you are, then I commend you. For everyone who thinks it should be lowered to revered, you�re wrong. It is much easier to get revered than exalted and you would see MANY more of these mounts if that was the case, but because you must be exalted, you rarely see anyone with this very unique mount. And about the 800g (if you�re rank 3 PVP) you make MORE than that just grinding for 210 hours straight so money shouldn�t be an issue. One thing that I think would be neat is have a �Use:� ability on the mount. If you noticed hunters have them as pets all the time and they can dash. How cool would it be to Dash on your mount that�s already going 100% to 150%. Does blizzard read this? Probably not but I just thought I�d let everyone dream :P. For myself I�m in it for the long haul and since my schedule is busier than most gamers I can�t continuously play for 4 hours a day, same quest, for 49 consecutive days. So it will take me closer to 3 months to get this mount, and I�m fine with that. Well I�m at work and wouldn�t have taken the time to type this all if I wasn�t so I hoped this helped anyone who was wondering about this awesome mount!\n\nAlso, say an epic drop is 1\/10000, or .01% chance to drop. By the time you reach exalted you will have killed no less than 1960 (probably more do to spawns and such) but that means 1960\/10000. that�s a 19.6% chance for an epic to drop, statistically. So who knows you might pick up an epic or two on the way :P, good luck!","date":"2005-10-14T17:02:47-05:00","rating":26,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Taress","importedSubject":"<Blank>"},{"commentv2":1,"number":9,"id":2710934,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Augustus\n\nThis isn't a bug, Blizzard have just changed the distance that it is possible for party members actions to affect your quest progress.\n\nAs for the people that think that this quest is \"ridiculous\" and Blizzard should make it easier. I completely disagree - the very nature of this mount is that it is incredibly difficult to get, and takes a large amount of time and effort. Having it like that enforces its rarity and makes sure only the people who do the work actually get to ride around on it.\n\nAlso, you don't have to be sad and have no life at all to get this mount, that's quite obviously the disgruntled view of someone who panics when they can't ninja an item.

So far I've turned in three quests (I didn't play all night... just for a few hours) and I'm halfway through another one now.\n\nI've found three decent greens so far, and I have skinning so I've gotten about forty stacks of various leathers, as well as a ton of vendor junk from the mobs.\n\nI'm planning on farming for this mount for as much time as possible over the next few weeks (months?), so I'll post updates every so often, for people who are interested.\n\n[b]Some answers to some common questions on this board:[\/b]\n\n1. The meats from the bears and chimaera are quest items, so you can't carry more than the alloted quest amount. That means you can have a maximum of 5 Shardtooth Meat and 5 Chillwind Meat with you at any one time. Meat in the bank counts, too.\n\n2. In order to actually [i]get[\/i] the mount, you must get to exalted with \"Wintersaber Trainers\" and then you can [b]buy[\/b] it from him. It's not free, sorry. Rivern Frostwind is the only person in this faction, and the only way to get rep with him is by doing his quests.\n\n3. That's just to get the mount. If you're not a Night Elf, you must also get to exalted with Darnassus in order to learn Tiger Riding before you can actually [i]use[\/i] the mount. And, of course, you must be level 60 to ride it, as it's an epic mount.\n\n4. The mobs you have to kill for Rivern's first quest have a [i]very[\/i] crappy droprate... Sometimes you will get all your meat in about twenty minutes, and sometimes you'll be killing for an hour before you're done just one quest.\n\n5. Yes, getting this mount takes a friggin long time, but that's the beauty of it. Unlike the ZG mounts, where you have to be either a ninja or just plain lucky to get it, this mount requires an extreme amount of effort to get. Maybe some people don't see what's so special about it, but I think you should be very proud of yourself if you've gotten it.\n\n[i]Aveliana\n58 human Paladin\nSmolderthorn[\/i]","date":"2006-04-15T05:02:47-05:00","rating":14,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Aveliana","importedSubject":"Starting out..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":16,"id":2711033,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Back again.&nbsp; Finally finish this horrible horrible yet addictive faction!&nbsp; Kudos to you guys who could get a lock and 2 othersto help you for summoning!&nbsp; It was hard enough to get 1 person to help let alone 3!&nbsp; Took me about 1.75 months to complete.&nbsp; WAY too much time in winterspring and I dont EVER want to go back!\n\n[url=http:\/\/www.geocities.com\/jaimelay@sbcglobal.net\/Kitty.jpg]http:\/\/www.geocities.com\/jaimelay@sbcglobal.net\/Kitty.jpg[\/url]","date":"2006-05-21T17:02:47-05:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"reddragoness","importedSubject":"FINALLY!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":17,"id":2711044,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"As of the latest patch, you now receive 75 rep for every turn in instead of 50.","date":"2006-11-20T05:02:47-06:00","rating":7,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"LuniNutz","importedSubject":"75 rep a turn in"},{"commentv2":1,"number":18,"id":2711058,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"As at 19.01.07\n\n[b]1.[\/b] There are 3 types of FROSTSABER mounts available\n\n[b]{Reins of the Frostsaber}[\/b] lvl [b]150 riding skill[\/b].

Others who are casual about getting mount,then just dont read this.\n\n1. Set your self a Quota&nbsp; to achieve each day. whether its 500 rep, 1,000rep, 1,500rep, 2,000 rep. And try and stick to that target. I set myself a target of 1krep a day while l was at work. When l started my holidays l increased this to 3krep a day\n\n2. Do not look at how much total rep is left. ONLY look at how much rep is left to achieve your quota for that day. Because if you look at the total amount of rep left, it will always be HUGE and seem soo far away.\n\n3. Try not to look at rep each time you hand in a quest. Do so every 30mins or hr or so. Then the gains seem bigger\n\n4. Once you get the [Winterfall Intrusion] quest, only concentrate on this one. It is the FASTEST quest to do assuming you have the village to yourself.\n\n5. Competing with other players for kills results in you taking longer to get your 5kill quota of each. If there are other players grinding or questing there, explain to them what you are doing. Then ask them if you can join them to share the kills. If you are willing as l was, forgo some of the loot to get kills. Remember Getting mount should be your first priority.\n\n6.&nbsp; Try going through different routes to see which is quickest. I found riding South along to road to Everlook and and then east to Winterfall Village ment l would not get dismounted. But this is a longer route. Going along a beeline from Frostsaber Rock to Winterfall Village is the shortest route. But chances are you will get dismounted along they way and thus increase the time it takes to hand in.\n\n7. If you get dismounted by a Chillwind Cimmera or a Shardtooth bear, then kill it. Cos if it drops Meat required for First quest, then you can collect it and once you have 5 of each, then thats another quest you can handed in.\n\n8. Lots of money to be made doing this quest. Whether your a herblist, skinner or miner, you will make lots and lots of money. When l first started this, l stoped to harvest every herb that appeared. Then about half way l stoped doing that and concentrated on just handing in quests. If l continued to harvest every ice cap that appeared, ld have more than 500+. As is now l have around 200 icecaps sitting in my bank, as well as around 20 Black lotus. I'd have more but l gave up stopping to harverst herbs so l can concentrate on getting the mount.\n\n9. If there is too many gankers there, log of and try again another time\/day or do something else. There really is no point wasting 2hrs trying to do one quest when you can go do a instance run or something in Real Life. All you end up doing is wasting your time and end up being farmed by another player for honor kills.\n\n10. In doing this quest l got Exaulted with Timbermaw hold before l got exaulted with Wintersaber Trainer. Remember to save all your&nbsp; Winterspring Beads till after you hit Revered with Timbermaw Hold, and then hand them in. Once you hit Revered with Timbermaw Hold, the only way you can only get rep from them is by handing in the beads and killing the Highchief in the Winterspring Village.\n\n11. Also once you get exaulted with Timbermaw Hold, they give you quest to kill a demon. to summon the demon they give you a torch. Once you kill the demon, you can hand in the items and get the Defender of the Timbermaw Trinklet. DO NOT HAND IT IN till you get your mount!.&nbsp; If you find there is TOO many farmers or gankers in the village, then just go summon the Demon and go away for a few hours. i did this once and saw a horde group of 4 wipe on it 2 times. Also l let the demon loose on 2 farmers camping the highchief's cave and let the demon kill em for me. One of the funnest thing l ever saw was a t2\/3 geared Tauren running away only to die from the demon's curses hahahahaha.\n\nI started this in middle Nov when rep gained was only 55still and not 82 as it is now. i got to 1.5k rep in early december. then hit 11k of Revered in Dec 30th. Went on holidays for 7 days and did the final 10k rep from 9th -19th of jan. Had to stop for 4 days cos everyone was waiting for Burning Crusade to come out so it was Gank Central in WinterFall village. After Burning cursade came out, l took my time getting the last 3k left to get mount. I finnaly got it around 2:30pm 19th of Jan 2007. At one stage l was spending 9-10hrs grinding away to get 3krep a day But it was worth it.! nothing felt soo good in this game as the day l got my mount and rode on it. Good luck to all who are trying get it.

With that in mind, the times being measured are travel time and the \"gathering time\" for encountering and killing each set of mobs.&nbsp; I have timed quests from the when I left frostsaber rock to the time I returned to turn in the quests (this does not include emptying bags, getting more arrows, blah blah blah).\n\nResults: \nFrostsaber provisions:&nbsp;

Sometimes this quest can take a half hour or more, and becomes quite frustrating!&nbsp; \n\nThe winterfall intrusion quest is best IF and ONLY IF the place is not camped.&nbsp; And by camped, I mean one or two people killing is enough to slow this quest way down to anywhere from 19 mins to 32 mins, since the camp usually has just enough mob population to do one quest.&nbsp; I usually like killing the Chief Winterfall while there if its not camped, since he always drops a winterfall firewater potion&nbsp; ($$$ and\/or great AP buff).&nbsp; You also get Eko that gives a strength buff JuJu if you have your Cache of Mau'ari handy.\n\nRampaging giants was never camped, had good drops (tons of recipes, patterns, and greens), is a great source for AP JuJu, but was a long ride.&nbsp; The green magic items usually disenchant to Greater Eternal Essences and Illusion dust for you enchanters out there ($$$).&nbsp; The giants weren't that tough at lvl 70, but then again, I'm a the universally hated easy-mode hunter :)&nbsp; I usually start on the far south side, and there are usually enough to complete the quest.&nbsp; If there are not enough there, across the bridge and to the east and west are two more sets of two that usually fill the quest.&nbsp; And if worse comes to worse, down into the ravine...&nbsp; \n\nIN ADDITION:&nbsp; SHORTCUT!&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have a light repair bill, after finishing giants, just jump in the ravine and kill yourself, then rez at Everlook... it saves 3 minutes.&nbsp; It will take you 6 minutes to turn in quests and get back to Winterfall village for the next round of kills, so if you are a 70, you can keep killing with the 75% damage reduction (or at least i could) and finish being rez sick by the time you killed 4\/4 shamans and ursas.&nbsp; I have been doing both the WF intrusion and Giants naked&nbsp; and rezzing at Everlook.&nbsp; Looks funny but hey, it saves me 3 mins a run FFS!\n\nWhat I find best is to have both the intrusion quest and the giants quest at the ready...do the giants, then do a pit stop at Winterfall Village to check on its farm status.&nbsp; If you see dead bodies in the front area, dont waste your time--just turn around and hand in the giants quest then go back for another round of giants.&nbsp; If you see the village to be untouched, do both the giants and the intrusion quests, which only takes 22.4 mins for both (or better, if you know the shortcuts).&nbsp; Also, if you do both quests, by the time you turn in both quests and return to WF village, it will be completely respawned (and usually with a chest there too!)\n\nSave your beads, you will get the timbermaw trinket long before you get this mount :) \n\nGood luck, and remember:&nbsp; since BC came out,&nbsp; ZG is on farm status by many noob guilds for the mounts. That makes the frostsaber mount probably the rarest in the game, since you have to grind for many hours to get it.&nbsp; People in this game just dont have that kind of patience, so when you see one of these mounts on your server, you know this guy is hardcore, tenacious, and partially insane!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; (Ive only seen one so far on my server, and ive seen people riding them in crossrealm AV only twice in 2 years play)\n\nGood luck, and don't give up :)&nbsp; Why be like everybody else?&nbsp; And now that all this is said, plan your route, and never look at the clock or your rep again&nbsp; :) just go and do it...\n\nP.S. got mine April 27, 4:30 am&nbsp; :)&nbsp; \/sigh&nbsp; :)","date":"2007-04-15T05:02:47-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"boatswain","importedSubject":"Times for each quest revisted"},{"commentv2":1,"number":25,"id":2711147,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"[url=http:\/\/i94.photobucket.com\/albums\/l83\/AngelsMark\/WinterspringFrostsaber.jpg]http:\/\/i94.photobucket.com\/albums\/l83\/AngelsMark\/WinterspringFrostsaber.jpg[\/url]\nHit Exalted today and finally I got the mount.

That's right, 13 days. I got fired from a job (LOL) and decided to just go all-out nuts for it. I played at least 10 hours a day, every day. I'd just like to add some thoughts about my experience.\n\nMy method was to go from Rivern to the Winterfall camp, then to the giants in the south, then back to Rivern. In this way, I found it to be a lot less repetative; each trip took longer, but I was doing more than one quest at a time. Also, it was more satisfying to get chunks of 150 rep rather than just 75.\n\nI went from level 62 to 66 during this grind. Considering I would get ~140 exp from the furbolgs (if any) and ~400 from the giants, that's absolutely insane, and a very good indicator of how much work this grind demands.\n\nAs a combat rogue with good BC gear for my level, I would average 6 seconds a kill for the furbolgs, and 20 seconds for the giants. I give mad props for people who play classes who take much longer to kill things (i.e. paladins) and got this mount. I must have played about 130 hours at least, but the thought of taking 4 or 5 times longer per kill is just staggering. Hats off to you. (While we're on the topic, I give mad props for people who did this back in the day, where the mount itself cost 900, epic mounts were 900, the rep reward per turn-in was 50 instead of 75, and pre-BC where you were limited to level 60 and raid gear which pales in comparison to that which is obtainable now. That was truly a grind, whereas now it has become much more of a cakewalk, not to trivialise it too far.)\n\nA couple tips:\n\n-BUY AN EPIC MOUNT BEFORE YOU START THIS BEAST! Since I literally murdered these creatures (not even stealthing, it would slow me down), the heart of the grind was in the runs to and from Rivern. Looking back, I'd blow my brains out if I had to do this with a non-epic mount.\n\n-Princess Tempestria is a level 60 elite that is on a 2 day timer or so. Don't hesitate to stop and kill it for loots. You will be informed of its arrival by a yell similar to Azuregos, and also be able to look at Lake Kel'theril for a bunch of water elementals. If they are there, it is most likely also there. Get a pal to do it if you aren't capable, it is a fairly difficult solo kill. I was able to do it at 65 armed with a couple greater frost protection potions.\n\n-As far as phat loot goes, I wound up with a Krol Blade, some blue plate gloves, blue plate shoes, and blue cloth shoes, along with 3 or 4 random Darkmoon Faire cards. Greater Frost Prtotection Potion recipies drop like mad from the giants, and I somehow managed to sell at least 15 of them for around 6g each. I honestly don't know how the hell they all sold.

What about Chal Fairwind?\n[b]She does nothing for Non Night Elves![\/b] Even if you click on her repeatadly after you reach exalted with the Wintersaber Trainer faction. :)\n\nI guess I should be bitter but I'm half way to an uber mount is the way I see it, the other half I need is Darnassus reputation.  I'm a human that's exalted with the Wintersaber Trainer Faction and now I'm going back to grinding for Darnassus repuation.  Besides, I helped a night elf guild member get the mount along the way so its an accomplishment either way.\n\nI'm posting this in case any 'non night elves' missed the info in one of the varies threads here and there.  You need tiger riding training from Darnassus to be eligible to use the end reward for doing Rivern Frostwinds quests.  I've petitioned a GM to suggest to developers that the wording from \"rivern frostwind\" be changed so that 'in game' content would give some sort of hint or warning that non night elves are not eligible for the reward without the required Darnassus faction standing.\n\nIf any player is serious about grinding for the reputation it might not be a bad idea to get it out of the way now until Blizzard updates the morrowgrain to feathermoon quest and or adds high level repuation quests similar to the ones available for the argent dawn.\n\nThat said I'll share some useful information that may or may not have been posted elsewhere in these forums about Rivern's quests. Here is a link to a Nigh Elf who completed the quests and posted great information about the quest http:\/\/forums.worldofwarcraft.com\/thread.aspx?fn=wow-quests&t=19324&p=1&tmp=1#post19324\n\n[b]FACTS:[\/b]\nQuest Perspective: Human Warrior\n\nRepuation Mod Used:  Measures in the following fashion:\nNuetral bar 3000 pts\nFreindly bar 6000 pts\nHonored bar 12000 pts\nRevered bar 21000 pts\n\n[b]Repuation gained per quest turn in is 55 pts.[\/b]  Doesnt matter which quest, and it doesnt matter what your faction standing is.

This information is fact.\n\n1st quest \"Frostsaber Provisions\" . complete this meat collecting quest about 30 times and you get the 2nd quest, Half way through the neutral bar.\n\n2nd quest \"Winterfall Intrusion\" stick with this quest, its the most time efficient.\n\n3rd quest \"Rampaging Giants\" involves lvl 59 - 60 elites.  May require a group effort.  Travel is far from the quest giver. Takes too long to complete compared to the 2nd quest.  Even with a 100% speed increase mount.\n\n\n\n[b]Winterfall Intrusion QUEST TIPS:[\/b]\nEquipt: Carrot Stick\nAttach: Mithril Spurs for boots\n\n-Find ways to shave off minutes even seconds per quest run.  When you have to repeat a quest 764 times every second counts!\n\n-Find people that are doing the quest and group.  Its a kill count quest so every kill within your range counts.\n\n-If you see Alliance grinding for Timbermaw rep in the village ask them if they wouldnt mind grouping for your quest.\n\n-If you see Horde grinding winterfall ursa and winterfall shaman well what you do is up to you. PvP makes this tedious questing longer but its fun :)\n\n-If your grouped with friends that aren't turning in the quest and just helping out ask them to kill the \"winterfall den watchers\" inside the village so more shaman spawn for your return\n\n-[b]Uber Quest Tip:[\/b] Use a Warlock to summon you from Rivern Frostwind to the village over and over again.  Yes it requires a party of 4. 3 to summon plus yourself.  Yes I have payed Warlocks per summon if that's the incentive that was required.  Remember the price per summon may cost you 25slv but reaching exalted is priceless.\n\n[b]Times:[\/b]\nSolo'ing the quest can take as long as 20minutes per run, especially if there aren't enough shaman spawned.  Thats 3 quest turn ins per hour. Average is 15 minutes per run by yourself.\n\n2 or more pple and the quest run averages 10-15 minutes. so you can potentially average 6 quest runs per hour.\n\nUsing a warlock shaves off the 3 min mounted ride back to the village. So you can potentially complete 9 quest turn ins every 60 minutes. That almost 500 rep pts per hour :)\n\n\n[b]Exalted[\/b]\nAfter reaching exalted \"Rivern Frostwind\" gives you the option of a vendor pop up window that will allow you to purchase the mount for 900g (you can also sell some of your useless items to him as he is techanically a vendor now :)   )\n\nIf you are NOT a night elf  the mount is purchasable but the icon is \"red\" and \"requires tiger riding\" shows in red as well.  \/sigh.\n\n\nEdited, Sun Mar 13 20:21:28 2005","date":"2005-03-14T02:14:00-06:00","rating":28,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Excellent information.

The poster above me has some great links for the quests. It is rumored that in the expansion reputation obtained is increased so if you want to do this wait until then as it might be a less strenuous process.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>19583</b></h3>It would appear that by the description (&quot;very fast mount&quot; ) this is an epic mount, and yet it only requires 75 riding skill, making it unique and allowing you to save a good amount of gold. <br /><br />Still, it's not really worth the grind, imo. You'll need the riding skill eventually anyways to get a flying mount, and by then no one's gonna give a crap if you spent ungodly amounts of time to grind a rather plain looking cat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Pretty sure you get this from the NPC in Winterspring in the north, named Rivern Frostwind.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=57000">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=57000</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The people above mostly have no clue what they are speaking about.&nbsp; Let me elucidate.<br /><br />This is a special mount which is only obtainable from a vendor in Winterspring.&nbsp; In order for him to allow you to buy it from him, you need Exalted status with him.&nbsp; To get that status, there is a series of three quests you perform over and over and over (one quest you repeat to get from Neutral to Friendly, one from Friendly to Revered, etc.)&nbsp; Once you have Exalted with this vendor, you can purchase the mount from him for 900g.<br /><br />However, in order to ride it you need to have the Tiger Riding (1) skill.&nbsp; This is the same skill used by elves to ride their normal tigers, so an elf with this skill doesn't have to train in anything else.&nbsp; But if you are not an elf, you must gain Exalted status with Darnassus.<br /><br />There is only one way you can do this currently, by doing the Morrowgrain to Darnassus/Feathermoon quest.&nbsp; This is a repeatable quest you can do for Darnassus reputation.<br /><br />In short: it is an incredible achievement for an elf to get this mount, and a truly epic achievement for a gnome, human, or dwarf to get it.&nbsp; I have never even seen an elf with it in all my time playing (Earthen Ring server) and certainly no other races.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just finished up getting the faction for this mount, I'll try to answer a lot of the questions posted.<br /><br />Yes, you do need to be Exalted with the Wintersaber Trainers in order to buy this mount. It is NOT a rare drop or anything like that, it is sold to you by Rivern when you hit Exalted. You can only gain faction by doing the quests he offers.<br />You get the three quests at certain faction levels. The first at Neutral, the second at half way to Friendly, and the third at half way to Honored.<br />You must do the first quest 30 times to get half way through Neutral to get the second quest.<br />If you use a Reputation mod, you will see that amount of reputation goes Neutral&nbsp; -&gt; Friendly (3000) -&gt; Honored (6000) -&gt; Revered (12000) -&gt; Exalted (21000). In total, that is 42,000 reputation needed and each quest gives 50 reputation. Do the math, that's 840 quest turn-ins to reach Exalted. (Humans with the 10% faction bonus will need to do this 840-84 times, or 756).<br /><br />The first quest is based on a 20% drop rate of quest items and may take someone 45 minutes to an hour to this quest once. The second quest is based on killing a set number of mobs in Winterfall Village. The third quest is also based on killing a set number of mobs, but they are extremely hard Elite Giants and they are located on the other side of the map in Frostwhisper Gorge.<br /><br />All three quests give the same amount of reputation and the second one is by far the fastest, so you can decide which one to repeat. Assuming the quest takes you about 15 minutes to complete (including&nbsp; going back and forth to drop it off), it would take you a total of 210 real hours to do the quest 840 times. That is about nine days by itself, and seeing as how no one can play for nine days continuously doing this, it will take you months to get it (personally it took me a&nbsp; little over 2 months doing it every single day).<br /><br />Yes you also have to learn the Tiger Riding ability from Darnassus to ride this mount, Rivern does not teach it to you. That means if you're not Night Elf, you have to get Exalted with Darnassus before you can purchase and learn Tiger Riding.<br /><br />The mount was not given any armor or anything extra in the patch and still looks completely unique as compared to the other Night Elf mounts.<br /><br />You can only do each quest once before having to turn it in to get it again. You cannot collect an abundance of meats or kill a lot of mobs and get multiple quest credits at once.<br /><br />And finally, here's a pic so you can see how it looks:<br /><a href="http://marvel.poned.com/World%20of%20Warcarft/ReinsOfTheWinterspringFrost.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://marvel.poned.com/World%20of%20Warcarft/ReinsOfTheWinterspringFrost.jpg</a><br />(deliberately not linked in img since it is a big picture)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Human reputation boost is 10%. <br /><br />50 + (50 x .1) = 55<br /><br />You start at neutral (0) and halfway through neutral (1500) you can unlock the second quest.<br /><br />55 x 28 = 1540.<br /><br />I did this first quest as fast as 18 minutes, and as slow as 35 minutes. It mainly depends on the drop rate. Given that I�m going to take my lowest and highest and come up with a mean (average). (18 + 35) / 2 = 26.5 minutes<br /><br />26.5 x 28 = 12.366<br /><br />Now this is an estimate because you can�t be sure how often it will drop, and if horde will gank you or not. So it�s a little over 12 hours to get the second quest, not so bad when you think about it.<br /><br />Now that you have unlocked the second quest, Winterfall Intrusion, it�s all about grinding from then on. Kill 5 shamans and 5 ursas, and based from what everyone says it takes about 15 minutes to get the quest, ride over, complete the quest, ride back, turn in. so that is 4 quests per hour. <br /><br />55 x 4 = 210. <br /><br />That�s 210 reputation per hour. Now suppose you did this 4 hours a day.<br /><br />210 x 4 = 840<br /><br />That�s 840 reputation a day, 5880 a week.<br /><br />Now, how long till you�re finally reached exalted? Well let�s find out!<br /><br />Starting at 0 to open the second quest and gain 1540 reputation, it took 12.366 hours approximately. Now if you�re going to do it 4 hours a day EVERY day (this is not including the days you started the first quest, this is just including the days that you�ve been working on Winterfall Intrusion), then on the 49th day you will be exalted.<br /><br />How many hours of game play? Well it takes 4 hours to get 840 reputation, and 49 days of 4 hours of game play doing solely these quests.<br /><br />4 x 49 = 196<br /><br />And with the initial 12.366 hours it will take you 208.366 hours under IDEAL conditions. This means you weren�t killed once, you haven�t emptied your bags, you haven�t repaired, etc. I suggest you empty your bags before you start. Empty them after you�re done and repair after you�re done. And mainly ask yourself if you�re ready to devote 210 hours of your life to a mount. If you are, then I commend you. For everyone who thinks it should be lowered to revered, you�re wrong. It is much easier to get revered than exalted and you would see MANY more of these mounts if that was the case, but because you must be exalted, you rarely see anyone with this very unique mount. And about the 800g (if you�re rank 3 PVP) you make MORE than that just grinding for 210 hours straight so money shouldn�t be an issue. One thing that I think would be neat is have a �Use:� ability on the mount. If you noticed hunters have them as pets all the time and they can dash. How cool would it be to Dash on your mount that�s already going 100% to 150%. Does blizzard read this? Probably not but I just thought I�d let everyone dream :P. For myself I�m in it for the long haul and since my schedule is busier than most gamers I can�t continuously play for 4 hours a day, same quest, for 49 consecutive days. So it will take me closer to 3 months to get this mount, and I�m fine with that. Well I�m at work and wouldn�t have taken the time to type this all if I wasn�t so I hoped this helped anyone who was wondering about this awesome mount!<br /><br />Also, say an epic drop is 1/10000, or .01% chance to drop. By the time you reach exalted you will have killed no less than 1960 (probably more do to spawns and such) but that means 1960/10000. that�s a 19.6% chance for an epic to drop, statistically. So who knows you might pick up an epic or two on the way :P, good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Augustus<br /><br />This isn't a bug, Blizzard have just changed the distance that it is possible for party members actions to affect your quest progress.<br /><br />As for the people that think that this quest is &quot;ridiculous&quot; and Blizzard should make it easier. I completely disagree - the very nature of this mount is that it is incredibly difficult to get, and takes a large amount of time and effort. Having it like that enforces its rarity and makes sure only the people who do the work actually get to ride around on it.<br /><br />Also, you don't have to be sad and have no life at all to get this mount, that's quite obviously the disgruntled view of someone who panics when they can't ninja an item. Myself and about 3 other people on my server have been grinding this for about an hour a day for about 2 months or so, and we are 3/4 of the way there now.<br /><br />I think it's simple really, if you're not willing to put the time in, then read a different topic - don't get peaved at the people who appreciate the difficulty with getting this mount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So, I just started doing quests for this dude last night at 2:18am. So far I've turned in three quests (I didn't play all night... just for a few hours) and I'm halfway through another one now.<br /><br />I've found three decent greens so far, and I have skinning so I've gotten about forty stacks of various leathers, as well as a ton of vendor junk from the mobs.<br /><br />I'm planning on farming for this mount for as much time as possible over the next few weeks (months?), so I'll post updates every so often, for people who are interested.<br /><br /><b>Some answers to some common questions on this board:</b><br /><br />1. The meats from the bears and chimaera are quest items, so you can't carry more than the alloted quest amount. That means you can have a maximum of 5 Shardtooth Meat and 5 Chillwind Meat with you at any one time. Meat in the bank counts, too.<br /><br />2. In order to actually <i>get</i> the mount, you must get to exalted with &quot;Wintersaber Trainers&quot; and then you can <b>buy</b> it from him. It's not free, sorry. Rivern Frostwind is the only person in this faction, and the only way to get rep with him is by doing his quests.<br /><br />3. That's just to get the mount. If you're not a Night Elf, you must also get to exalted with Darnassus in order to learn Tiger Riding before you can actually <i>use</i> the mount. And, of course, you must be level 60 to ride it, as it's an epic mount.<br /><br />4. The mobs you have to kill for Rivern's first quest have a <i>very</i> crappy droprate... Sometimes you will get all your meat in about twenty minutes, and sometimes you'll be killing for an hour before you're done just one quest.<br /><br />5. Yes, getting this mount takes a friggin long time, but that's the beauty of it. Unlike the ZG mounts, where you have to be either a ninja or just plain lucky to get it, this mount requires an extreme amount of effort to get. Maybe some people don't see what's so special about it, but I think you should be very proud of yourself if you've gotten it.<br /><br /><i>Aveliana<br />58 human Paladin<br />Smolderthorn</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As at 19.01.07<br /><br /><b>1.</b> There are 3 types of FROSTSABER mounts available<br /><br /><b>{Reins of the Frostsaber}</b> lvl <b>150 riding skill</b>. Its one of the Night Elf racial mounts. Other allince races can get it by getting Exaulted with Darnassus and learning 150 riding skill.<br /><br /><b>{Reins of the Swift Frostsaber}</b> lvl <b>150 Riding skill</b>. PvP reward mount. Any Alliance can get this mount, simply by getting enough PvP tokens.<br /><br /><b>{Reins of the Winterspring Frostsaber}</b> lvl <b>75 Riding skill</b>. Only WINTERSABER TRAINER rep required . Any race can get this mount so long as you get exaulted with the Wintersaber Trainer.<br /><br /><b>2.</b> You only NEED rep with WINTERSABER TRAINER faction to get . For those who cant read english it means you DO NOT need to be exaulted with either the Dwarfs, Gnomes, Night Elfs, Undead, Troll, Orcs, Tuaren, GDI, NOD GLA, Allied or Soviet or Chinese Forces, Terran, Zerg, Protoss, UFP Humans, Vulcan, Romulan, Q, Klingon, Cardassian, Barjoran, Borg, Ferengi, Dominion, Centauri, Drakh, First One, League of non Aligend Worlds, Mibari, Narn, Pak'ma'RA, Shadow, Thirdspace Aliens, Vorlon, Jedi, Sith, Osama Bin Laden OR George Walker Bush (how ever being aligned with Dubba means your house has a 10% of&nbsp; not get bombed accidently by a USAF aircraft especially if its near a foreign embassy)<br /><br /><b>3.</b> Rep required : 42,0000 <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0 -&nbsp; 3,000 : Neutral&nbsp; - Friendly<br /> 3,000 -&nbsp; 6,000 : Friendly - Honored<br /> 6,000 - 12,000 : Honored&nbsp; - Revered<br />12,000 - 21,000 : Revered&nbsp; - Exaulted.<br /><br /><b>4.</b> You only need lvl 75 riding skill. So if you have a lvl 40 mount, then you can ride this one. Also - riding skills are universal, lvl 75 gnome riding skill is the same as lvl 75 Nightelf riding skill. If you learned it from one faction then you dont need to learn it from another faction.<br /><br /><b>5.</b> It IS an EPIC mount. It is the SAME SPEED as all other EPIC MOUNTS.Because its only needs&nbsp; lvl75 riding skill, it looks like other lvl 75 riding skill saber mounts. Meaning you have an Epic mount without armour. <br /><br /><b>6.</b> Price $$$ = 90g +lvl75 riding skill (which by lvl 60 you should already have).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The following is assuming you are at the front of the Winterfall Village and facing south. I've separated the Village into 5 areas for easier description.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the following is for those who want to get this mount as soon as you can. Others who are casual about getting mount,then just dont read this.<br /><br />1. Set your self a Quota&nbsp; to achieve each day. whether its 500 rep, 1,000rep, 1,500rep, 2,000 rep. And try and stick to that target. I set myself a target of 1krep a day while l was at work. When l started my holidays l increased this to 3krep a day<br /><br />2. Do not look at how much total rep is left. ONLY look at how much rep is left to achieve your quota for that day. Because if you look at the total amount of rep left, it will always be HUGE and seem soo far away.<br /><br />3. Try not to look at rep each time you hand in a quest. Do so every 30mins or hr or so. Then the gains seem bigger<br /><br />4. Once you get the quest, only concentrate on this one. It is the FASTEST quest to do assuming you have the village to yourself.<br /><br />5. Competing with other players for kills results in you taking longer to get your 5kill quota of each. If there are other players grinding or questing there, explain to them what you are doing. Then ask them if you can join them to share the kills. If you are willing as l was, forgo some of the loot to get kills. Remember Getting mount should be your first priority.<br /><br />6.&nbsp; Try going through different routes to see which is quickest. I found riding South along to road to Everlook and and then east to Winterfall Village ment l would not get dismounted. But this is a longer route. Going along a beeline from Frostsaber Rock to Winterfall Village is the shortest route. But chances are you will get dismounted along they way and thus increase the time it takes to hand in.<br /><br />7. If you get dismounted by a Chillwind Cimmera or a Shardtooth bear, then kill it. Cos if it drops Meat required for First quest, then you can collect it and once you have 5 of each, then thats another quest you can handed in.<br /><br />8. Lots of money to be made doing this quest. Whether your a herblist, skinner or miner, you will make lots and lots of money. When l first started this, l stoped to harvest every herb that appeared. Then about half way l stoped doing that and concentrated on just handing in quests. If l continued to harvest every ice cap that appeared, ld have more than 500+. As is now l have around 200 icecaps sitting in my bank, as well as around 20 Black lotus. I'd have more but l gave up stopping to harverst herbs so l can concentrate on getting the mount.<br /><br />9. If there is too many gankers there, log of and try again another time/day or do something else. There really is no point wasting 2hrs trying to do one quest when you can go do a instance run or something in Real Life. All you end up doing is wasting your time and end up being farmed by another player for honor kills.<br /><br />10. In doing this quest l got Exaulted with Timbermaw hold before l got exaulted with Wintersaber Trainer. Remember to save all your&nbsp; Winterspring Beads till after you hit Revered with Timbermaw Hold, and then hand them in. Once you hit Revered with Timbermaw Hold, the only way you can only get rep from them is by handing in the beads and killing the Highchief in the Winterspring Village.<br /><br />11. Also once you get exaulted with Timbermaw Hold, they give you quest to kill a demon. to summon the demon they give you a torch. Once you kill the demon, you can hand in the items and get the Defender of the Timbermaw Trinklet. DO NOT HAND IT IN till you get your mount!.&nbsp; If you find there is TOO many farmers or gankers in the village, then just go summon the Demon and go away for a few hours. i did this once and saw a horde group of 4 wipe on it 2 times. Also l let the demon loose on 2 farmers camping the highchief's cave and let the demon kill em for me. One of the funnest thing l ever saw was a t2/3 geared Tauren running away only to die from the demon's curses hahahahaha.<br /><br />I started this in middle Nov when rep gained was only 55still and not 82 as it is now. i got to 1.5k rep in early december. then hit 11k of Revered in Dec 30th. Went on holidays for 7 days and did the final 10k rep from 9th -19th of jan. Had to stop for 4 days cos everyone was waiting for Burning Crusade to come out so it was Gank Central in WinterFall village. After Burning cursade came out, l took my time getting the last 3k left to get mount. I finnaly got it around 2:30pm 19th of Jan 2007. At one stage l was spending 9-10hrs grinding away to get 3krep a day But it was worth it.! nothing felt soo good in this game as the day l got my mount and rode on it. Good luck to all who are trying get it. I hope&nbsp; what l learned will help you.<br /><br />I'm the on on the right, my friend who helped me is on the left.<br /><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/143/362480665_8f23818078.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/143/362480665_8f23818078.jpg?v=0</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm just adding to what has been written previously about times for each quest.<br />I am a 70 hunter with decent gear and a riding crop (10% mount speed increase), so killing and riding is relatively fast for each quest.&nbsp; With that in mind, the times being measured are travel time and the &quot;gathering time&quot; for encountering and killing each set of mobs.&nbsp; I have timed quests from the when I left frostsaber rock to the time I returned to turn in the quests (this does not include emptying bags, getting more arrows, blah blah blah).<br /><br />Results: <br />Frostsaber provisions:&nbsp; Avg time 19.2 minutes<br />Winterfall Intrusion:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; non-camped: 10.4 mins<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; camped:&nbsp; 22.3 mins<br />Rampaging Giants:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Avg time 14 mins (best time 12 mins)<br />Giants and Intrusion:&nbsp; &nbsp; Avg time 22.5 (best 20 mins exactly, 17 mins using shortcut!)<br /><br />I would not suggest doing the provisions quest at all past the initial questing stage, since it had a wide range of completion times depending on the meat drop rate.&nbsp; Sometimes this quest can take a half hour or more, and becomes quite frustrating!&nbsp; <br /><br />The winterfall intrusion quest is best IF and ONLY IF the place is not camped.&nbsp; And by camped, I mean one or two people killing is enough to slow this quest way down to anywhere from 19 mins to 32 mins, since the camp usually has just enough mob population to do one quest.&nbsp; I usually like killing the Chief Winterfall while there if its not camped, since he always drops a winterfall firewater potion&nbsp; ($$$ and/or great AP buff).&nbsp; You also get Eko that gives a strength buff JuJu if you have your Cache of Mau'ari handy.<br /><br />Rampaging giants was never camped, had good drops (tons of recipes, patterns, and greens), is a great source for AP JuJu, but was a long ride.&nbsp; The green magic items usually disenchant to Greater Eternal Essences and Illusion dust for you enchanters out there ($$$).&nbsp; The giants weren't that tough at lvl 70, but then again, I'm a the universally hated easy-mode hunter :)&nbsp; I usually start on the far south side, and there are usually enough to complete the quest.&nbsp; If there are not enough there, across the bridge and to the east and west are two more sets of two that usually fill the quest.&nbsp; And if worse comes to worse, down into the ravine...&nbsp; <br /><br />IN ADDITION:&nbsp; SHORTCUT!&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have a light repair bill, after finishing giants, just jump in the ravine and kill yourself, then rez at Everlook... it saves 3 minutes.&nbsp; It will take you 6 minutes to turn in quests and get back to Winterfall village for the next round of kills, so if you are a 70, you can keep killing with the 75% damage reduction (or at least i could) and finish being rez sick by the time you killed 4/4 shamans and ursas.&nbsp; I have been doing both the WF intrusion and Giants naked&nbsp; and rezzing at Everlook.&nbsp; Looks funny but hey, it saves me 3 mins a run FFS!<br /><br />What I find best is to have both the intrusion quest and the giants quest at the ready...do the giants, then do a pit stop at Winterfall Village to check on its farm status.&nbsp; If you see dead bodies in the front area, dont waste your time--just turn around and hand in the giants quest then go back for another round of giants.&nbsp; If you see the village to be untouched, do both the giants and the intrusion quests, which only takes 22.4 mins for both (or better, if you know the shortcuts).&nbsp; Also, if you do both quests, by the time you turn in both quests and return to WF village, it will be completely respawned (and usually with a chest there too!)<br /><br />Save your beads, you will get the timbermaw trinket long before you get this mount :) <br /><br />Good luck, and remember:&nbsp; since BC came out,&nbsp; ZG is on farm status by many noob guilds for the mounts. That makes the frostsaber mount probably the rarest in the game, since you have to grind for many hours to get it.&nbsp; People in this game just dont have that kind of patience, so when you see one of these mounts on your server, you know this guy is hardcore, tenacious, and partially insane!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; (Ive only seen one so far on my server, and ive seen people riding them in crossrealm AV only twice in 2 years play)<br /><br />Good luck, and don't give up :)&nbsp; Why be like everybody else?&nbsp; And now that all this is said, plan your route, and never look at the clock or your rep again&nbsp; :) just go and do it...<br /><br />P.S. got mine April 27, 4:30 am&nbsp; :)&nbsp; /sigh&nbsp; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><a href="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c331/KarlDonitz/FrostsaberMount.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c331/KarlDonitz/FrostsaberMount.jpg</a><br /><br />I got this monster 2 days ago, after 13 days of grinding for it. That's right, 13 days. I got fired from a job (LOL) and decided to just go all-out nuts for it. I played at least 10 hours a day, every day. I'd just like to add some thoughts about my experience.<br /><br />My method was to go from Rivern to the Winterfall camp, then to the giants in the south, then back to Rivern. In this way, I found it to be a lot less repetative; each trip took longer, but I was doing more than one quest at a time. Also, it was more satisfying to get chunks of 150 rep rather than just 75.<br /><br />I went from level 62 to 66 during this grind. Considering I would get ~140 exp from the furbolgs (if any) and ~400 from the giants, that's absolutely insane, and a very good indicator of how much work this grind demands.<br /><br />As a combat rogue with good BC gear for my level, I would average 6 seconds a kill for the furbolgs, and 20 seconds for the giants. I give mad props for people who play classes who take much longer to kill things (i.e. paladins) and got this mount. I must have played about 130 hours at least, but the thought of taking 4 or 5 times longer per kill is just staggering. Hats off to you. (While we're on the topic, I give mad props for people who did this back in the day, where the mount itself cost 900, epic mounts were 900, the rep reward per turn-in was 50 instead of 75, and pre-BC where you were limited to level 60 and raid gear which pales in comparison to that which is obtainable now. That was truly a grind, whereas now it has become much more of a cakewalk, not to trivialise it too far.)<br /><br />A couple tips:<br /><br />-BUY AN EPIC MOUNT BEFORE YOU START THIS BEAST! Since I literally murdered these creatures (not even stealthing, it would slow me down), the heart of the grind was in the runs to and from Rivern. Looking back, I'd blow my brains out if I had to do this with a non-epic mount.<br /><br />-Princess Tempestria is a level 60 elite that is on a 2 day timer or so. Don't hesitate to stop and kill it for loots. You will be informed of its arrival by a yell similar to Azuregos, and also be able to look at Lake Kel'theril for a bunch of water elementals. If they are there, it is most likely also there. Get a pal to do it if you aren't capable, it is a fairly difficult solo kill. I was able to do it at 65 armed with a couple greater frost protection potions.<br /><br />-As far as phat loot goes, I wound up with a Krol Blade, some blue plate gloves, blue plate shoes, and blue cloth shoes, along with 3 or 4 random Darkmoon Faire cards. Greater Frost Prtotection Potion recipies drop like mad from the giants, and I somehow managed to sell at least 15 of them for around 6g each. I honestly don't know how the hell they all sold. In total, I probably made ~1400g, very helpful, since I would probably never get enough for a flying mount otherwise, since I am terrible with gold spending, lol.<br /><br />In any case, this mount is fantastic, and its a constant, awesome looking reminder the effort put into getting it. Truly a great reward.<br /><br />Hydroscopic<br />Gnome Rogue<br />Gurubashi (US)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone know if I need tiger riding skill for this mount or is normal riding skill of 150 enough, because I already have an epic mount (Dreadsteed)?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I read today somewhere this quest is now bugged and you can get the mount instantly? Someone wanna shed some light on this?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I hit revered 2 days ago, been grinding some everynight. Sadly, the faction is so slow, Im about 10% into revered. Its going to take me all month to get to exhaulted I think. =(<br /><br />Ive had thoughts about giving up, but Im too far now to give up. I have the cash, its sooo tempting, but then I remember that its a unique mount. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well I'm a NE rogue on arthas and im exactly 59 quest turn ins from exalted. I've been doing it grouped with a full group of other NE's and a gnome. 1st of all the mount is 900g considering your exalted faction with them by the time you get exalted. Secondly, with Sergeant rank from PVP-ing, that 900g mount price drops to 800g, so it's definitly worth PVP-ing for that bonus. Since, I'm on a pvp server...i just killed the horde that got in my way occasionally and that worked out beautifully. As for humans, dwarves, and gnomes. Getting it now is not as impressive as getting it before the most recent patch...but just because you can get tiger riding now doesnt mean it's any easier to get. Just the rep grinding alone is enough to drive you crazy. Definitly faster and more entertaining doing it grouped. I should have my walking epic mount later this week...i can't wait...i'll be the 1st in my guild to get it and 4th on the server to get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Requirements needed for this are:<br /><br />Night Elf players: Honored with Darnassus<br />Other Factions: Exaulted<br /><br />All Factions: Exaulted with Wintersaber Trainers<br /><br />Cost: 800g or 900g depending on your rank<br /><br />This works great if you have two accounts, also if you have a group. It sucks because neither or those really help much on the days you don't get credit for the kills while up on the rock, on the days you do get credit, it rocks and you fly through the rep.<br /><br /> Happy Farming</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It looks damn sweet</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It requires Tiger riding so I'm doubting anyone but NE's can use it for now. Thank god I'm an night elf! I'm doing the quests 1-2 times a night, hoepfully in a year I'll have him :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Finally after weeks of farming for this I got it, like 15 mins ago. NE hunter on EU Emerald Dream, afaik first to have it on this server.<br /><br />It's so pretty! ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Need to do the first quest 840 times total to get this mount.<br /><br />With the new patch allowing you to turn in cloth for fame, exalted with Darnassus is not a huge issue.<br /><br />The fact that you're honored with Frostsaber Trainers would make the purchase price of this mount 900g I'd assume, plus the minor Darnassus riding training fee. If you're a skinner you'll probly get this from doing the quest 840 times.<br /><br />This mount looks like one of the daddy frost sabers that are blue and white, think they're called Pride Watchers? (forgive me, forgot the name and too lazy to look it up)<br /><br />The pure shock value of this mount is more than enough to do it, even if it isn't armored. The best alliance rogue on my server got one, seeing a human running around on a big ol' frostsaber is awesome, made me freak when I saw it today. The rogue went so far as to reveal that he had had the mount for a few months, and just hadn't been able to get exalted with Darnassus until the patch.<br /><br />That's all I know regarding this mount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dont like that saddle it has. I would prefer it bareback. Now that would look WAY better</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i have done about 10%¨<br /><br />4600/42000 = 10.9% (3000+1600) the best quest to do is the second quest you get. and my advice to all is do it late like after midnight. or very earlie (before 7 on the morning) then you dont have hord or other players that steel your shamans!<br /><br />and i will get it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What is the speed boost on this mount because i'm confused... 75 skill but lvl 60 to get this mount... :S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This may sound wierd but where do you get all these quests to raise your reputation to exaulted with the elves?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>hm you need to have exaltet faction with damassus to learn tiger riding....and currently theres only the morrowgrain faction quest that would give you the chance to get thos 1-39k faction points you d need as a none elf. Unfortunatly this quest turns grey way bevor 60 and give only 10% of the faction it use to give at 52+.<br />If anyone realy try to get this tiger as none night elf....get a couple freinds and farmt he crater till you got enough faction for the tiger as soona s you reach 50+.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Rumor has it that if one is mind controled by a priest, they take on the reputaion of the priest. If that really is true, then one could be mind controled by a high level night elf priest to have the reputation for a period of time. If so... you might want to make it worth the priest's time to help.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I Reached exalted as a Human and still need Darnassus repuation to learn tiger riding. What about Chal Fairwind?<br /><b>She does nothing for Non Night Elves!</b> Even if you click on her repeatadly after you reach exalted with the Wintersaber Trainer faction. :)<br /><br />I guess I should be bitter but I'm half way to an uber mount is the way I see it, the other half I need is Darnassus reputation. I'm a human that's exalted with the Wintersaber Trainer Faction and now I'm going back to grinding for Darnassus repuation. Besides, I helped a night elf guild member get the mount along the way so its an accomplishment either way.<br /><br />I'm posting this in case any 'non night elves' missed the info in one of the varies threads here and there. You need tiger riding training from Darnassus to be eligible to use the end reward for doing Rivern Frostwinds quests. I've petitioned a GM to suggest to developers that the wording from &quot;rivern frostwind&quot; be changed so that 'in game' content would give some sort of hint or warning that non night elves are not eligible for the reward without the required Darnassus faction standing.<br /><br />If any player is serious about grinding for the reputation it might not be a bad idea to get it out of the way now until Blizzard updates the morrowgrain to feathermoon quest and or adds high level repuation quests similar to the ones available for the argent dawn.<br /><br />That said I'll share some useful information that may or may not have been posted elsewhere in these forums about Rivern's quests. Here is a link to a Nigh Elf who completed the quests and posted great information about the quest <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-quests&amp;t=19324&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post19324" rel="nofollow">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-quests&amp;t=19324&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post19324</a><br /><br /><b>FACTS:</b><br />Quest Perspective: Human Warrior<br /><br />Repuation Mod Used: Measures in the following fashion:<br />Nuetral bar 3000 pts<br />Freindly bar 6000 pts<br />Honored bar 12000 pts<br />Revered bar 21000 pts<br /><br /><b>Repuation gained per quest turn in is 55 pts.</b> Doesnt matter which quest, and it doesnt matter what your faction standing is. You get 55 repuation pts per quest turn in.<br /><br /><b>&quot;Total&quot; quest turn ins needed to reach exalted = 764 times.</b> Information elsewhere may be incorrect. This information is fact.<br /><br />1st quest &quot;Frostsaber Provisions&quot; . complete this meat collecting quest about 30 times and you get the 2nd quest, Half way through the neutral bar.<br /><br />2nd quest &quot;Winterfall Intrusion&quot; stick with this quest, its the most time efficient.<br /><br />3rd quest &quot;Rampaging Giants&quot; involves lvl 59 - 60 elites. May require a group effort. Travel is far from the quest giver. Takes too long to complete compared to the 2nd quest. Even with a 100% speed increase mount.<br /><br /><b>Winterfall Intrusion QUEST TIPS:</b><br />Equipt: Carrot Stick<br />Attach: Mithril Spurs for boots<br /><br />-Find ways to shave off minutes even seconds per quest run. When you have to repeat a quest 764 times every second counts!<br /><br />-Find people that are doing the quest and group. Its a kill count quest so every kill within your range counts.<br /><br />-If you see Alliance grinding for Timbermaw rep in the village ask them if they wouldnt mind grouping for your quest.<br /><br />-If you see Horde grinding winterfall ursa and winterfall shaman well what you do is up to you. PvP makes this tedious questing longer but its fun :)<br /><br />-If your grouped with friends that aren't turning in the quest and just helping out ask them to kill the &quot;winterfall den watchers&quot; inside the village so more shaman spawn for your return<br /><br />-<b>Uber Quest Tip:</b> Use a Warlock to summon you from Rivern Frostwind to the village over and over again. Yes it requires a party of 4. 3 to summon plus yourself. Yes I have payed Warlocks per summon if that's the incentive that was required. Remember the price per summon may cost you 25slv but reaching exalted is priceless.<br /><br /><b>Times:</b><br />Solo'ing the quest can take as long as 20minutes per run, especially if there aren't enough shaman spawned. Thats 3 quest turn ins per hour. Average is 15 minutes per run by yourself.<br /><br />2 or more pple and the quest run averages 10-15 minutes. so you can potentially average 6 quest runs per hour.<br /><br />Using a warlock shaves off the 3 min mounted ride back to the village. So you can potentially complete 9 quest turn ins every 60 minutes. That almost 500 rep pts per hour :)<br /><br /><b>Exalted</b><br />After reaching exalted &quot;Rivern Frostwind&quot; gives you the option of a vendor pop up window that will allow you to purchase the mount for 900g (you can also sell some of your useless items to him as he is techanically a vendor now :) )<br /><br />If you are NOT a night elf the mount is purchasable but the icon is &quot;red&quot; and &quot;requires tiger riding&quot; shows in red as well. /sigh.<br /><br />Edited, Sun Mar 13 20:21:28 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So horde can't use it ? :((<br />Thats unfair, what do we get?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Does anyone have a picture of this mount (in action)? Is it stripped only or is there an option to have him be just light blue?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First off, there are 3 quests in the series. <br /><br />The first quest : Frostsaber Provisions. Do this quest exactly 30 times (gets you halfway to neutral).<br /><br />The second quest : Winterfall Intrusion. Do this quest exactly 120 times (gets you to honored).<br /><br />The third quest : Rampaging Giants. Do this quest if you want, I dont recommend it. The faction hit is the same as the second one. Doing the 2nd quest is easier and faster. <br /><br />Now, for the confusing part. The NPC says &quot;Only the most TRUSTED and REVERED&quot; may be eligiable to attempt to ride this tiger. <br />So, according to the quest giver, you only need revered faction. I will find out very soon anyway. Im sitting at honored as of now.<br /><br />~ Demona ~<br />Sword of Fate<br />Malygos Server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>wait i'm a little confused can you get this mount being a night elf with whatever faction you ahve at the time?<br /><br />sorry for being confused lol</div>
