It really is a quintessential druid weapon for anyone who plays this class, but especially for druids who want to do some tanking (and you should...it's fun!). It's available at a relatively low level, but unless you find it as a drop, you're not likely to have the 200 or so gold to buy it from the AH until your in your 50s or 60. Regardless, this weapon will last you well into the Burning Crusade so you should definitely pick it up. If you are in a raiding guild past the Twin Emperors in Ahn'Qiraj, you have access to the Blessed Qiraji Warhammer. This one handed mace with feral attack a small amount of armor is the only weapon in the current WoW that beats Warden Staff for general tanking. Even so, you will want to hang on to the Warden Staff for fights that emphasize heavy physical damage mitigation such as Broodlord Lashlayer.\r\n\r\nAs far as enchants go, I would recommend the 25 agility enchant. For feral dps, there is little question that strength is better (even in cat form), but there is more to tanking than just dps. Agility helps a ton with damage mitigation as well as giving you more (although less consistent) aggro through crits. I have extensive endgame raid tanking as a druid and point for point, I regard agility and strength as about equal. Of course, the amount of epic feral leather is rather limited and generally the decision on which pieces to use is made for you by what's available. But in the case of enchants, you do have to decide. And when it comes down to 25 of one great stat vs 15 or another, it's a no brainer.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wortham</b></h3>This is the best non-raiding tanking weapon a druid can find, giving you over 1000 more armor in bear form in addition to the 10def! However, expect to pay anywhere from 100-350g for it if you care not to invest the time to farm one up. <br /><br />In addition, I'd suggest putting a 15str enchant on there since this is the only stat that will affect your attack power in bear form. The 25agi is another option, but less attractive IMO, since although it adds to your crit and dodge chance, it does not increase your attack power in bear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Merowlin</b></h3>The question remains of what enchant to choose. I personally agree with wortham regarding 15str enchant - However some prefer 25agi.<br /><br />- 15str gives you 30AP (2.14dps) which is good, considering bearform not dealing that much damage, thus every inch of steady dps increases your treat level.<br />- 25agi gives you 50 armor (not affected by bearform armor bonus/thick hide) AND 1% crit+dodge - wich is nice, but critical strikes will always be unreliable, especially for tanking (treat caused).<br /><br />On another note, the overall stats on this staff is amazing for Bearuids. +10 defense makes hitting you, the same as hitting a lvl 62 if you're lvl 60. as well as 11 stamina always being a nice boost.<br />The 260 Armor is also very nice for Bearuids considering the value is increased by 360%, meaing 1196 Armor while in dire bear, and if talents are spent in thick hide, the 260 equals 1316 in dire bear.<br /><br />- Merowlin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4274</b></h3>As a bear druid, +15 strength is much more useful than +25 agi.<br /><br />Unlike Warriors, your threat generation is multiplicative instead of static. With enough attack power, you can dish out a crit that is effectively 10 sunders. You want as much Strength and Stamina as you can get, squeezing in every ounce of armor as well for damage mitigation.<br /><br />I still haven't managed to find one of these, so I'm about to break down and spend 250g on it. Well worth it, imo, since you'll be using it even into Burning Crusade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4274</b></h3>Update: got one for 160g this morning. Now I just need to get the mats for a Strength Enchant and it's on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4274</b></h3>Ok, I've readjusted my take on tanking slightly. I would recommend more that someone put a +25 Agility enchant on this staff. Here's why:<br /><br />As a bear druid, you want high agility AND high strength. Now, your strength gives you 2AP per point - +15str is only 30 Attack power. +25 agi is 1% chance to crit - much more useful. Because druid threat is multiplicitive, the more crits you can dish out the more threat you will generate. You may only throw an effective 9 sunders as opposed to the 10 I mention above, but you'll do it more often by focusing on agility here.<br /><br />Sorry to spam, it's not like I get the option to edit my posts :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>djtez</b></h3>This is a rare world drop. This is also currently one of the best feral druid tanking items you can get your hands on thanks to 260 Armor. I have mine enchanted with +25 agility. My druid is lv60 and I still use this staff for bear tanking in instances and have tanked all the 5 man bosses including the Baron. <br /><br />The only place you are realistically going to find this staff (unless you are extremely lucky) is on the auction house, so get saving your gold now!<br /><br />If you are a bear tank you should also consider picking up a Cloak of Warding <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18413">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18413</a><br /><br />Possible alternative for druids lv57 or higher is the Unyielding Maul <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18531">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18531</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lysistrata</b></h3>I'd personally say this is the best tanking twohander for druids well into the epic level - no other two-handed weapon that I can think of adds stamina AND armor AND defense.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, druid threat scales *extremely* well with how much damage they put out. I put the 25 agility enchant on my Warden Staff for the extra dodge - because since bears can't parry, that is our only other mitigation stat besides the insane amounts of armor we have. 15 strength...okay, I guess, if you have trouble with aggro generation. Personally, I'd argue in favor of getting more strength/AP on the rest of your gear (+strength to gloves, or some of the PVP reward armor with good strength statistics) and shelling out for the agility weapon enchant.<br /><br />As with anything else, your mileage may vary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7260</b></h3>The era of the venerable Warden Staff is coming to a close. The upcoming expansion for the World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade, has a much superior weapon called the Earthwarden. Wowhead does not have a link for it at this time, so sadly I cannot post it, but attainable after reaching Exalted status with the Cenarion Expedition faction.<br /><br />This weapon has a respectable 500 armor on it, +defense, +FAP, +crit rating, and +feral weapon skill. The name of it makes me smile a little knowing that it is paying homage to its predecessor.<br /><br />There will always bit a slot in my bank (and occasionally my backpacks!) for my very first epic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7700</b></h3>Great feral druid staff which increase armor by over 1000. This item is a necessity for any feral druid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sheanna</b></h3>Though this staff is really only a minor upgrade from the free Unyielding Maul in the Dire Maul North tribute box, many druids still regard this as an essential purchase. It really is a quintessential druid weapon for anyone who plays this class, but especially for druids who want to do some tanking (and you should...it's fun!). It's available at a relatively low level, but unless you find it as a drop, you're not likely to have the 200 or so gold to buy it from the AH until your in your 50s or 60. Regardless, this weapon will last you well into the Burning Crusade so you should definitely pick it up. If you are in a raiding guild past the Twin Emperors in Ahn'Qiraj, you have access to the Blessed Qiraji Warhammer. This one handed mace with feral attack a small amount of armor is the only weapon in the current WoW that beats Warden Staff for general tanking. Even so, you will want to hang on to the Warden Staff for fights that emphasize heavy physical damage mitigation such as Broodlord Lashlayer.<br /><br />As far as enchants go, I would recommend the 25 agility enchant. For feral dps, there is little question that strength is better (even in cat form), but there is more to tanking than just dps. Agility helps a ton with damage mitigation as well as giving you more (although less consistent) aggro through crits. I have extensive endgame raid tanking as a druid and point for point, I regard agility and strength as about equal. Of course, the amount of epic feral leather is rather limited and generally the decision on which pieces to use is made for you by what's available. But in the case of enchants, you do have to decide. And when it comes down to 25 of one great stat vs 15 or another, it's a no brainer. Go with the agility.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8072</b></h3>What a wonderful staff for a feral druid. This is one of the few items obtainable before level 50 that gives you substantial boost in your Hitpoints and AC while in Dire Bear form. +10 Defense will help you avoid more critical strikes, and the 46.5 DPS is magnificent for a level 43. Worth 200-300g in most Auction Houses. Worth every penny if you are feral specced. You will most likely use this weapon until level 60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Niekon</b></h3>I managed to get this staff when I was 43 thanks to my brother grinding in WPL at the time. And have kept it ever since to my current level of 58 and will probably last me into BC. It has some of the best stats for a solo feral druid that I have seen of all the possible weapons for my class.<br /><br />If you can find it in the AH for a decent price or manage to get a guildmate or friend gets this drop be extremely thankful. You will be hated by most Warrior tanks since your armor will likely surpass theirs. ^_~</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>35131</b></h3>The added agility, if you choose that enchant, will help you generate crits, which help keep you healthy if you have Improved leader of the pack.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this staff is a Druid weapon. the armor is important for Dire Bear form. This staff on any other class is a huge waste.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is a druid staff, without question. A warrior or paladin would be wasted on this staff because they can both use SHIELDS.<br /><br />The fact that this adds stamina, armor and defense means that a druid will be able to wear more INT/SPI gear and still be able to be an excellent tank when in bear form.<br /><br />Right now, a druid using cloth int gear is making a huge sacrifice to their ability to tank in bearform. This staff actually allows a druid to have their cake and eat it too.<br /><br />-D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone who says it's better used on any other class is ATLEAST slightly retarded. Is it good for other classes? Yes. But no class can use that item to 150% of its potential, save Druid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this Staff at the AH for 22g, man someone must be really mad that they only sold it for that much, good for me tho :P<br /><br />(Just about had a heart attack when i saw how much it was) I am a Druid BTW&nbsp; :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The armor bonus is perfect for a druid, in dire bear form the armor bonus comes to about 1200 extra Armor. I dont see why anyone else would roll on it, just slap on a +22 int. enchant and it'd be a very nice end game weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Had this drop in ZF from random troll. Looting policy was pass on Blue, epic, BOP. Everyone passed but the pally - Lanceilot - rolled and therefore got it. He would not give it to the druid, said he was going to AH it for the gold. Yeah I know we should not have let it happen, but what an asshat to keep that from a druid after he got Ripsaw from previous boss. Once again Lanceilot , guild Arch Angels on Eldre`thalas. Don't let him in your group. Total greed monger ninja.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Probly 'the' best for druid tanks, Pretty nice for moonkin too. i got this puppy at 43 (traded a bow of searing arrows for it) and at lvl54 it still serves me well, my dire bear/moonkin forms sport 7k+ armor, will probly have it at lvl60 sence i prefer thick armor as opposed to high spir/int.<br /><br />If you cant afford one/find one though i wouldnt sweat it, the ogre king in dire maul drops a similure 2h mace for when you hit 57 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=36117">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=36117</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>put +15AGI or even +25AGI on it and you're fine. Lvl60 druids use this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have this staff on my feral druid.&nbsp; At 60, I still get TONS of use for it.&nbsp; This staff plus mark of tyranny plus some atal'li shoulders from ST and I get over 9300 armor.&nbsp; During one UD strath run while tanking, I got 11,700 armor because of a shammy's heal that procced the armor increase.<br /><br />If you can't find one on your server, you can come close to this staff by getting an unyielding maul in DM tribute.&nbsp; I really don't see any time at all when I won't be using this staff as my bear form wep and I've been a #3 tank in MC too with it.<br /><br />Oops double post.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bought this for 230 from a guy spamming it in SW. The contribution from this item ALONE in my dire bear form is just shy of a grand. Definately worth it for aspiring druids.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My war just picked one up in the Searing Gorge off a Heavy War Golem of all things.&nbsp; I thought at first it might be a nice armor boost for soloing with my Healer Priest, but now I think it deserves a better home than that.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I love to read thottbot forums for simple pleasures...<br /><br />The fact is obvious who would benefit most from this staff, but that doesn't mean it is only for that class.&nbsp; If a caster wants to spend the money on this staff or gets a lucky drop, more power to them.&nbsp; Putting up a post to flame the person for it only proves the simple minded-ness and lack of creativity that is common among the WoW player base, as well as the over-abundance of carebears (referring to people that farm instances all the time, not feral druids in bear form as someone not familiar with the term might think :P ).&nbsp; Of coarse a caster would not group with this.&nbsp; My above post (a few up) was simply asking if any soul link locks have had experiance with this staff <b>PVP</b>.&nbsp; My intention was not to start another slew of &quot;this item is for this class only&quot; posts.&nbsp; PVP is the only reason in my honest opinion I could see using this.&nbsp; Any one that knows the lock class knows what it is capable of.&nbsp; Think about it:&nbsp; Soul Link with VW for huge health pool, master demo for 10 % dmg migitation with VW out, demon armor for 570 armor bonus plus 15 hp every 5 sec.&nbsp; The staff will add +10 defense, an additional 260 armor, and 110 more HP which actually translates to more with the dmg migitaion and sharing of health with VW.&nbsp; And thats just the staff with skills/spells, not eqauting other gear the warlock might have.&nbsp; Most of us are stam hogs...&nbsp; Even two peices of Dreadmist (or full set Deathmist) with give you another 200 armor.&nbsp; All the while a lock will be constantly regening health using drain life.&nbsp; The only obvious downfall is the lack of int, which can be remedied with an enchant.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I hope my point came across that thinking more creativily and proper distribution of talent points, this staff would at least be formadable choice for a soul link build warlock looking to take on more than one person at a time in the battlegrounds.&nbsp; AV, probably not so much becasue it is more group and team oriented than the other BG's.<br /><br />BTW, I know I can't be the <b>only</b> person that has thought about this, so any locks who have tried it out please post.&nbsp; I don't have the money to try this out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was in Maraudon on my priest with 2 guildies and 2 PUs when it dropped. No druids in the party so we greeded it. A guildie won and asked whether I'd sell it if I had it. I said No Way! My druid would get it, or another guildie. So he gave it to me! I sent it to my 60 feral druid and now I'm happy happy. It's *awesome* Now considering what 2H enchant would best suit a tanking druid...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>From a Druids point of view this is the ultimate tanking weapon, hands down in the whole game. kinda strange considering the fact that it's a world drop lvl 43 epic. And I am hoping for an upgrade soon, but until that happens... /love Warden Staff<br /><br />Here are the reasons why this staff is so great:<br /><br />- Armor, it has 260 armor on it, which yields 1196-1316 armor depending on spec.<br /><br />- Stamina is always great, even 11 Stam is good.<br /><br />- +10 defense makes hitting you, the same as hitting a lvl 62 if you're lvl 60<br /><br />There are no substitues for this Staff, the Unyielding Mace from DM comes as a medium second, but it does pale in comparison to the might of The Warden.<br /><br />As for the arguement over which enchantment to put on it:<br /><br />- 25 Agi gives you crit-chance, dodge-chance and 50 armor. All great for tanking which this staff was designed for.<br /><br />- 15 Str gives you 30 AP (2.14dps) that's pretty much it. And the argument that the 15 Str is better for catform? Get a mace with catform stats then, it'll give you more of the stats you want in catform anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Warden Staff grants you a huge AC which grants you damage reduction, it also gives you +10 defense which effectively makes you 2 lvls harder to hit.<br /><br />Blanchard's Stout gives you 20 strength which is 2.8 dps, that's it. I would use Blanchard or a weapon of eaqual or better stats for cat dps, since 260 armor in cat is inferior to the dmg output you would need to take the enemy down fast.<br /><br />Agi or Int. If you want to tank using the Warden, don't you dare to put an intellect on it, a druids tanking is all about maxing out the stats you need. <br /><br />And if you have swiftmend that would suggest that you have a 20/31 spec, a passable tanking spec I can give you that, but for the real endgame tanking you would have to respec to a maxed out tanking spec.<br /><br />Then the +22int will be a joke because of Heart of the Wild. <br /><br />If you want to use the Swiftmend spec for PvP, get Exalted with Arathi Basin and get the Ironbark Staff better for that spec by a long shot</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is a world drop so from every kill within its lvl range it can drop, but most druid will not have it drop and will have to rely on buying it... no matter though, being the best tanking staff in the game it is worth the 100-200g you will pay for it :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, so the staff may be better for one class then the next.. But it's completely asinine to say it wont do any good for any class but a druid. Please! <br /><br />I put this staff in my warlock and its been a whole different game for me. Now i can actually take a beating and not watch my health drop like a stock market crash. The armor this staff adds benefits ANYONE wearing cloth. If you think otherwise, then you don't know whats its like to be a level 48 and have 1000-1200 armor. Give or take a couple hundred.<br /><br />What's the first thing people try to do to the warlock when they confronted in the battleground or the world? Run up on his ass with swords in &quot;cheap shot&quot;, invisible mode and start breaking our casting bar so that we cant get one single spell off and break down our cheesy cloth gear.<br /><br />Well, the game has suddenly changed once you equip a warden staff. They can run up on me all they want now, because now i have the extra time i need, due to a HUGE armor boost, to get them off me with a Fear/Death Coil, drop the Curse of Elements, throw down the Immolate and then crush them over and over and over with the Searing Pain and its game over or them in less then 20 seconds.<br /><br />Before i had this staff is was HELL getting those bastards off me with a Fear/Death Coil before i was almost dead. Now its just funny to watch these cats roll up on you thinking your gonna drop like a fly, like they normally would, and finding out that they aren't doing much damage at all before i Fear/Death Coil them off me and there getting pummeled with fire. <br /><br />If your a warlock who knows anything, then you know how important stamina, defense, and armor are to your survival. Don't listen to these schmucks who claim your an idiot for equipping this item if your anything but a druid. Complete utter bull$%^&amp;. This staff is a perfect for a warlock and they know it. There just trying to hold you back from getting any more brutal then you already are. Buy/Equip one and you'll see!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Now that The Burning Crusade has released, how good is this thing anymore? I just got one while making the Mallet of Zul'Farrak and, being a priest, have absolutely no use for this thing, but I have no idea how much to sell it for. Suggestions?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have this staff and it does not glow, but no better staff for a druid who goes direbear to tank........added AC multiplied by 3.6 when you shapeshift.......come on</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dropped of the Ghosts in Azshara. What a wonderful surprise this morning when I was all by myself. And I am a druid too! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3><div class="quote-box">Although this staff may be better for a Druid - it is still a great staff for the cloth classes for one reason; The level you can wield it. I am lvl 45 Shadow Priest and I am looking at one of these in AH now. I have never seen a staff that would be so good for me (soloing etc) at this level. <br /><br />Maybe it is not the best I can hyave at lvl 60, but at 45 is would be excellent. </div><br />I really advise against that line of thinking--for the price of this staff (often arround 200g) you could buy yourself something usefull for you 'forever'--something useful to your build/class at 60.<br /><br />You may regret it later when you are 200g short for that awesome item you've allways wanted.<br /><br />P.S. If you find one of these and are not a druid, I strongly suggest selling it and using the money for something more in-line with your class for endgame.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got mine from Heavy War Golems in Searing Gorge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well dude as you se here the staff is not for warriors becouse warriors are not those who use staff ... well ill tell you what this staff is for .. its for feral druid .. a feral druid needs defence stamina and armor . never equipp this staff if you are not a feral druid .. then you can rather sell it and get cash and buy something else .. :) i once was feral druid and used this staff and it was a dream staff as feral, then i changed to resstoration again and now i regret equipping it becouse it sux so badly with no intellect or spirit..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I need to rub myself for good luck. I had this drop off an elemental in Ferals on Garona with my Shaman, sold the thing for 350g about 4 months ago.<br /><br />The other day I was on my druid on Emerald Dream and the thing dropped AGAIN. I took it for myself this time and I love it. Slapped a +15 agility enchant on it and I'm good to go... I have so much armor in bearform! It is ridic!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was fortunate enough to be in a good PUG in Sunken Temple when this dropped. I have been saving for a while for this staff, and I'm a Feral Druid. So Naturally I offered lots of gold to each member of the group if I could have the staff. There was another Druid, she didn't want it, she was a healer druid. So, lots of gold later, and a great group of understanding folks, I have my Warden Staff. Best tank druid weapon in the game. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This staff is absolutely wonderful for Druids. It dropped for me off one of the elite trolls on the way into Sunken Temple (outside the instance). I was shocked when my pick-up party passed on it for me. I use it as my weapon when I am not healing, and when I am dueling. Rogues bounce off me when I wear this in bear form. I also use it as a weapon for soloing, where the defensive skill and stamina comes in handy, as well as the high speed for a staff, which helps Omen of Clarity. I don't see this benefiting anyone other than a Druid, but what do I know.<br /><br />Now I just need a Cloak of Warding.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been playing WoW since a few weeks after launch, and during all that time, I've only gotten two epic drops (meaning, while out soloing; I've certainly seen epics drop in raids). The first was with my very first character, probably well more than a year ago, and the second was last night, on one of my many alts. Interestingly, both epic drops were the Warden Staff. Interesting to me, anyway. I imagine the odds against getting the same epic world drop twice are pretty high.<br /><br />Anyway, this one will be sold as well, but it looks like I'll be getting far less than I got the first time around. Back then, I think I got about 250g for it. Looks like it's going for less than 200 now. <br /><br />Anyone on Duskwood, horde-side interested, send a message to Strummer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The difference between druids and all other classes is that for a druid this is an endgame weapon. I doubt any other class would use this staff at level 60, when they can get so many other staffs with more class-specific boni, such as critical hit chance for spells and added spell dmg.<br /><br />For a druid this is the best there is. It has higher armor and defense bonus than the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18531">Unyielding Maul</a>, and for a druid the dps doesnt matter, since when in caster form he'll equip other weapons anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found one of these on a highborne lichling last week while grinding by myself. Funny, because I just bought one about 6 days before for 250G. Have mine listed for the same right now. Refund!<br /><br />And the prvious posters are right, if you are not a Feral Druid or a Monnkin Druid, there is no reason why you should equip this staff. The 260 armor converts to 936 in Dire Bear and moonkin form with the 360% bonus, so it's really wasted on other classes. <br /><br />I'm planning on getting a +22 intell enchant on it and respec my feral to be a moonkin!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been researching items to give me more armor, since in PvP I'm targeted pretty quickly. At level 55 with buffs I can have upwards 5000 health as warlock, but armor remains terrible. This is one of the few items in the game that can significantly improve my armor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I had this beauty drop off of an owlbear thing in Hinterland near the Altar of Zul. (Shadowsong)<br /><br />When I went to IF to try to sell it, I found that there were none in the AH, so I didn't know what to sell it for....<br /><br />I put it &quot;WTS Warden Staff&quot; in the trade channel, with no price advertised. Someone messaged me, asking how much, and I told him to make me an offer. &quot;175 gold&quot; he says. O_o<br /><br />Although this is more money than I have ever come close to having, I still worked him up to 210g!<br /><br />This was my first Epic drop, and I am a 2H axe-using warrior, so I didn't need it. That gold will come in handy, however......hehe....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just got mine offa a wolf in felwood and being nice with a 140g b/o. tried giving to a friend (druid) but he said he had something that was just as good. second epic drop but first was worth 400g cause it was 1 month into the game :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Paid 280g on a relatively young server (Smolderthorn) I thought it was a pretty good deal for the staff and the age of the server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Guys, If you ever find this staff, and your not a druid. Sell it, it is absolutely not worth anything to any other classes. And by this I mean that on any average server this staff can yield you a good +200 g, and not taking this money and using it on something else as a mage/warlock/priest is just plain stupid...<br /><br />On the other hand, druids, this is the best staff. I simply love it :D</div>

I agree that it is a wonderfull druid staff but there not the only ones who need armor and health. I do PVP all the time and they usually go for me thinking that i will be a quick kill, but this staff does let me take a few extra hits so i have time to fear them before i die then own them. Overall yes use it if ur a Lock or Druid, Mages no.</div>

Not because they need the player slot for a real tank but because feral druids are so anoying and useless in so many ways at the same time that it will decrease the spirit of all other raid members by 100 for each bear that is in the raid. Aint worth it. But you can sell the staff for a lot of gold to these wannabe tanks.</div>
