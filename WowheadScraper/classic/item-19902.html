getting this mount. In fact although I could not \/ would not stop fellow guildies who already have an epic mount rolling \/ spending DKP on this - I'd be disappointed in them for doing so. \n\nMy logic goes like this: If you already have an epic mount you are actually weaking your guild by taking this, as other guildies will now have to spend 800 Gold (or however much it is) or months in the BGs (ie time not spent helping out the guild or each other and improving their characters) getting one. You can buy a lot of stuff with 800 Gold. \n\nFor the people who think it's a status symbol, well... I think the thing that gets you respect or status in your guild or even on a server is how you treat others and how much you contribute, not the colour of your mount. \n\nFood for thought anyways.\n\nbtw - I reckon raptors are the coolest looking mount in the game (esp epic ones) but this tiger is about as close as it gets lol.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I disagree. It's an epic, very rare drop and I believe that everyone has a right to roll for one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am Kaienta from Stonemaul Alliance side and I am a proud owner of this mount...I didnt have my epic mount until I rolled a 97 against the rest of my guild (Verndari)in ZG...I feel everyone else in my guild had the right to roll on this...Yes this mount is too rare and getting this mount is a symbol of a players RAID time...I always get stopped while riding and I tell everyone where to get one...I dont care if someone allready has an epic mount because when it comes to rarity all member who work with each other to have this lil tiger drop all have the rights to claim!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its a beautiful mount i give it that. I'd love to have it. I grinded a long time to get my epic mount. Some people dont have that kind of time and i think it would be a generous gesture to let someone who dosent have an epic mount have this bad boy. But in truth it is just an epic drop that EVERYONE has a right to roll on. Generousity is just something to think about.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>According to Allakhazam (yes, i came to thottbot first; it doesnt have the drop rates), there is a 0.80% chance, or 1/125 chance, of dropping off High Priest Thekal. Divide that by the 20 people in your raid, and you get <u>1/2500</u>. I think farming for four months would be easier than running Zul'Gurub 2500 times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><a href="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y158/Haephestion/Tiger6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y158/Haephestion/Tiger6.jpg</a><br /><br />I rolled a 98 against 20 people, some guilded, some not. I think that since it's very rare (What is it, .02?) that everyone, with an epic or not, should be able to roll on it. Why should the people who haven't ponied up the 800 gold for the mount get rewarded for it?<br /><br />It's such a rare thing that everyone should roll.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dropped tonight. Our guild has a very good system worked out. We use a Zero Sum DKP system and have ZG points seperate from other instances. Many of us in the guild have been around farming ZG, learning the fights from Veno up. our system allows everyone to roll regardless of mount status. they roll 1 - points earned<br /><br />for instance i had 263 points earned. we tack an extra 100 on for everyone so i<br />/roll 1-363 <br /><br />i rolled 100... /cry<br /><br />however our OT and highly dedicated member of our guild had 346 points earned in ZG, the most of any player in the guild. <br />he /roll 1-446<br /><br />he got 443<br /><br />needless to say he won this beautiful mount and no one was angry. He had worked his tail off for this mount and everyone was givin a chance at it. just the people who had been around longest had a (much) higher percentage at winning it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My main is Kaienta, I play on Stonemaul Server.&nbsp; I have been a proud owner of this Swift Zulian Tiger since December of 2004.&nbsp; This mount is the biggest attention grabber in all major cities as well.&nbsp; Fortunatly I was the first to get this mount from my guild with a winning roll of 97 on my first 20 man raid.<br /><br />My view towards arguements from Noobs saying &quot;I dont have a epic mount it should mine&quot; is as follows.&nbsp; This mount would no day in hell drop for you without the help of the 19 other members in your raid to kill the boss or clear the zone.&nbsp; Any drop which is considered unique and can used by any class has the right to roll for this mount because of it is rare.&nbsp; If a player with a winning roll decides to either (A: Sell to a fellow Raider before looting) or (B: Keep it for himself) its the winning rollers choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes I got mine based on luck or fate, but the point being is stop being greedy and stop whining and just try your luck to earn this mount, thats right earned because people never get anything for free without giving a little.&nbsp; Good come to those who wait!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Based on the number of people that have reported getting this mount since ZG openned, I'm thinking that its droprate is nowhere near as rare as the Baron's Deathcharger. The same can be said for the Swift Razzashi Raptor. If you want an epic mount drop, go play in ZG, and forget the Baron. (Of course, a 0.25% droprate still isn't stellar.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This has not dropped for my guild yet and we are running ZG once a week - so it may never drop :P. <br /><br />Thing is though, and I know that this is a point of contention, I feel that if you already have your epic mount - from a untilitarian point of view - there is no point rolling / spending DKP getting this mount. In fact although I could not / would not stop fellow guildies who already have an epic mount rolling / spending DKP on this - I'd be disappointed in them for doing so. <br /><br />My logic goes like this: If you already have an epic mount you are actually weaking your guild by taking this, as other guildies will now have to spend 800 Gold (or however much it is) or months in the BGs (ie time not spent helping out the guild or each other and improving their characters) getting one. You can buy a lot of stuff with 800 Gold. <br /><br />For the people who think it's a status symbol, well... I think the thing that gets you respect or status in your guild or even on a server is how you treat others and how much you contribute, not the colour of your mount. <br /><br />Food for thought anyways.<br /><br />btw - I reckon raptors are the coolest looking mount in the game (esp epic ones) but this tiger is about as close as it gets lol. Consequently the other one you get off the Blood lord would be my choice - but that's just me ;) they both look great. Grats to the mounted.</div>
