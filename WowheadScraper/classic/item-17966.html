<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8403</b></h3>This bag drops like crazy, so get your guild to do Ony at least once per week, you'll eventually have full 18 slotters, and it's definitely cheaper and less stressful to simply take 30 mins to kill Ony than to farm for countless bone fragments and core of elements' for the AD reward bag. Besides, you may get some awesome epics in the process!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dragonfyr</b></h3>Agree, this drops alot of the time from Ony. Shame it isnt a Blue item :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GRAND</b></h3>The same arguement could be made for Shamans and there totems or Rogues with their poison.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Apparantly this will be 18slot in next patch</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><i>Let me get this straight...she drops a bag made from her own hide?<br />LOL</i><br /><br />Prehaps its a pouch under her belly that you can use as a bag. It does not actually have to be a bag that has been sewn by a Tailor. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>So,<br /><br />18-slot are the largest bags around, that I've noticed so far. Somebody mentioned a frame for a 20-slot bag they saw inside an .mpq... fine, maybe Blizzard will make those available when inflation skyrockets...<br /><br />I've seen fairly few comments on this particular bag though. Its not unique, so you could have more than one of them, right?<br /><br />If Onyxia drops this bag, everybody has to roll for it, no?<br /><br />And if you go kill Onyxia, you have to be in a raid, no?<br /><br />Seems like a sweet drop if you look at the percentage... 90 or 95%.<br /><br />Doesn't the chance you get this bag drop dramatically since the whole raid rolls for it?<br /><br />Anybody got two of these? :o)<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I personally hate the blizard dice.&nbsp; I never use them in any instance beyond zul farrak.&nbsp; For killing a boss like onyxia, or any boss inside mc, the blizz dice are probably the worst way of dealing out loot.&nbsp; At this point in the game you should either be in a giuld, or large group of ppl that you can trust. <br /><br />&nbsp; I like the lottery idea for items like this bag.&nbsp; Just have raid leader, or whoever is in charge of loot do a /rand 40(or whatever the ammount of ppl in your raid happens to be) the first person in group 1 would be 1, and the last person in group 8 would be 40.&nbsp; Other items are pretty class/role specific, and would only have a few ppl rollig on them anyway</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My Guild have Onyxia on farming status and kill her every week.<br /><br />Killed her about 20 times so far through various patches....<br /><br />This 18 slot Bag drops 100% on every kill along with at least 3 epics (2 headgear and 1 other NICE epic) a bunch of high level Blue items, and Onyxia scales.<br /><br />All Onyxia (and other MC/BWL instances) looting is set to Free-For-All and loot is distributed via a modified DKP system ... exept for this bag.<br /><br />For looting of this bag, the 40 (ish) people in raid gather at Onyxia's head and roll /random 100 (only if they don't have bag already) and winner loots for Free ... no DKP points spent.<br /><br />We do this because EVERYONE needs an 18 slot bag and since 1 drops every week, this method seems the fairest way to distribute them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You cant buy it.. It is BoP..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>it's perfectly concievable that dragons shed their skin like any reptile, and that use can be made of the shed skin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually, bag space is more important for {class}.&nbsp; With all the gear for {job-1} and {job-2} and {job-3} I've eaten up tons of slots already.&nbsp; Then I'm a {profession-1}/{profession-2} which consumes a bunch more slots.<br /><br />I also reserve a few slots for {mana or healing} pots and {reagent} and {bandages}.&nbsp; Don't forget my conjured {water or food} from a mage.&nbsp; With all that stuff and five 16 slot bags I only have {random 1-32} slots for picking up stuff.<br /><br />All you {other-class} are second to {class}, we should always get first priority.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>FACE IT! this bag is for everyone regardless of how bad you need it.&nbsp; as a hunter enchanter i relize that bag space is precious but i still wouldn't be willing to suicide on this item considering my &quot;raid&quot; list is&nbsp; of about 80 different people who come on our guild raids.&nbsp; I wouldn't waist a suicide or much DKP on this because as ive seen it most guilds can have someone make bottomless bags for you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, here's the deal... If you decide to join a high end raiding guild... you do it for various reasons including the fun of it, meeting cool people, and the loot. Pretty much the best loot in the game comes from raiding high level instances. So... let's do some role-playing here... I am a guild officer mage who preordered WoW and have been playing since day one... and you are a recruit mage that just learned that you have a pretty funny spell called polymorph... we've just massacred Golemagg and the Staff of Dominance drops... question is... who deserves it more, or do you just crapshoot roll on it? Well, how do we handle things like this in real life... if you're the recruit at a job... you do the b*tch work... while the seasoned employees get the good hauls... it's called putting in the time and earning it. (I know, heaven forbid?) This also prevents somebody from joining a raid guild, nabbing one or two sweet epics, then ditching to PvP or farm all day... while leaving your dedicated players with the shaft. <br />Sure, it sucks waiting your turn for the loot, but you will get it... and besides, getting the vets geared out before you can only help you to get through instances further. Boo hoo... you'll get your Netherwind, etc. if you put some damn time into the game instead of whining.<br />Amen, that is all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>MOst hig-end raidng guilds don't Even rol, they use a DKP system. to them raidng is obsolete</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sadly the raid leader just /roll (number of people in the raid)and it goes to that person.&nbsp; Been waiting about 6 months to get bigger bags, was hoping to have one of these by now</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Same for me as the person above, been to 99% of all our onyxia runs for 6-8 months or so and I've never won it.<br /><br />The best way (IMO) is to give the bag a cost of 25-75RP/DKP so that those who accually need this can&nbsp; get one or more of them instead of giving it to people who just think &quot;meh I won the roll I'll take it&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hunters and lock needs to have a ammo bag and locks a soul bag so they can take less with them as other classes so they should get 18 slot bags first</div>
