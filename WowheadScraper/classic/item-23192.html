The drop rate posted here looks very very low but it might be counting kills on the Trainees back before they dropped the Tabard thus lowering the average.\n\nI could make it through to Herod only killing a few mobs here and there. You can use Mind Control to split some of the mobs apart that are tied together like the first 2 you run into... Or get some free damage done while you regen mana. I also used Mind Control when a mob got to about 20% health to keep them from running and aggroing more buddies... Just put on Shadow Word : Pain and hold them in place while they die. You'll want to be getting to Herod as quick as possible since it will probably take a few runs and runners pulling mobs mean more wasted time.\n\nIf you are crafty with your Mind Soothes you can get to Herod only fighting maybe 4-5 guys but as a raid specced healbot it was more like 10 cause I would always end up snagging one or three by mistake. Make sure you mana burn the palidens and the only problems you might face is the Myrmidons since they can cancel a school school of magic... so 2 on you at once it is safer to just Shield, Renew and Wand since you dont wanna risk being caught with no spells to use...\n\nI have some pretty good mana regen so in tough times getting busted soothing in a packed hallway and having to chain fight 15 guys without a mana break due to runners I still wouldn't get offed even though they hit pretty fast in packs...\n\nThe Zig Zag hallways you can actually bust straight down the center and split the difference without aggroing... as long as you watch for the patrols and duck to the side when they come...\n\nHerod is no problem... just dont be a dummy and stand in his blade of light attack... I found myself only getting in one Mind Blast and one Smite before he went immune again... with some practice I would have a Holy Fire winding up to hit right as he came out of spinny mode. 4 helms, 3 pants, 1 shoulder, 1 ravager later... The tabard dropped.\n\nAs long as you have enough mana for one Holy Nova ya can drop all of the trainees  at once... But even a wand or staff knock can take em down...\n\nIf they dont drop it I sometimes would run back out and reset the instance... or just get naked and die and res quicker than trying to ninja sneak your way back out.

They are very weak and a group capable of killing Herod (or 1 level 60) should wipe these guys out with absolutely no trouble. <br /><br />Mine dropped the first time I went after it, so I can't speak to how difficult the drop is. It looks cool compared to most tabards, happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6046</b></h3>I also got mine on the first attempt. It does look relatively nice for a relatively small amount of work (assuming you're 60), but there are better looking tabards around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alisdair</b></h3>If you have somone in your group who came specifically for this item, be careful when autolooting the corpses after Herod. This is a 'white' item but it is still Bind on Pickup. I've accidently taken one of these from someone before because I auto-loot all the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Poker</b></h3>This item is very rare, it's a lone drop that can't be rolled for since it's white, and it's a unique tabard which mostly only higher levelled players keep since it's more attractive than their guild tabards - I know I have one (that looks especially nice with the Judgement Legs)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8558</b></h3>This item has a very low drop rate. Players who are patient enough, will eventually have one drop and be satisfied with their work.<br /><br />I was lucky and had mine drop on the first try =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7343</b></h3>The tabard is now green item in patch 2.0 , don't know if you can roll for it, but you should be able to.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>evoker</b></h3>As of patch 2.0 this item can be rolled unless the loot is not set to FFA or ML.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8588</b></h3>This item drops off of the Scarlet trainees, got mine on my first run solo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Merowlin</b></h3>I got this on the first try with my Shaman, and 8th try with my Hunter. even though the droprate is low. quite a number of Scarlet Trainees runs into the room, making the possibility to loot this rather high.<br /><br />The loot percentage and number of loots on this item might be wrong on sites such as thottbot and wowhead, because this item was not obtainable until recently (patch 1.11 I believe).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>20421</b></h3>Forget which patch, but after it went green I did 2 runs on my 60 rogue to get it, soloed Herod, then as the trainees came I stealthed, let them line up in the middle, grabbed them all and used my Ramstien's Bolts of Lightning to instant kill them because they only have 100 hp each.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sentan</b></h3>As a level 39 Undead Warlock, level 70 Troll Hunter, who was my GM, took me through the armory for Herod since he was all I had left, the Trainees came and we killed them with ease, first Trainee dropped this Tabard which he let me have, then another had one which he took, seeing as how it's Unique and he had wanted one for awhile.<br />Plus the shoulder pads and ravager dropped, and he let me DE them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Covv</b></h3>This took me 3 runs as a disc/holy priest. You really only need to kill a few mobs to get to herod: the 2 at the entrance, three crusaders in the hallway at the top of the first set of stairs, and then 2 more in the 2nd to last hallway. The rest can be avoided if you are 60+.<br /><br />You may wish to kill the roamers if you don't want to risk it. Happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jonathoncottrell</b></h3>i see this all the time, mages seem to be so in demand for an instance that i once got invited to do SM ARM 5 times in one day, the tabard dropped about 7 times<br /><br />park a mage near the door and tell them to spam arcane explosion as soon as herod dies, that'll take care of all the traineese with ease</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>breakfast</b></h3>hah omfg i got this in the funniest way possible..well more time consuming than anything. i ran this with my hunter, and it dropped 8 times in about 20+ runs. everytime i was with a group and it dropped, i would always tell them that i've been farming sm arm just for this. many of them had no clue what it was but decided to need it anyways. funny how things work out, once i hit 51 i soloed this and got it on my first try. for some reason i started farming sm arms for ravager to complete my obsession with the sm suit, i had every piece but the chest. man even though i walked through it, FD at the part nearly at the last hallway, i didn't finally get ravager till just last friday? man ill tell you what though, some people are really heartless. but at least i got it in the end though. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>27212</b></h3>Ive been through about 7 times and guess wut no tabard and i thought herod dropped it not the trainees im only lv 34 but i can solo up to about herod then need a lil help to kill him and the trainees r way 2 easy i just turn retaliation on and watch the body's drop</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>39231</b></h3>There are roughly 20 Scarlet Trainees to kill per run. With an average drop rate of 1.5%, statistically you should see one within 5 runs.<br /><br />If you are unlucky (like me), you will see zero in 30+ runs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>prelude</b></h3>I was farming for this on my 62 Mage, because seriously have you seen how ugly the good cloth chest quest rewards are in Outland <br /><br />Took 6 runs till it dropped.<br /><br />A mage my 60+ should be able to avoid all the mobs there through fancy footwork and a couple blinks and can get to Herod in about &lt;5 minutes. Also, Herod's blues that he drops are disenchanted into small radiant shards which go for a good amount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>48268</b></h3>the drop rate on this sucks sooo bad but im on my like 33rd or 34th run and it dropped finally dropped! but it wasnt easy<br />but i find it usefull if you arent lvl 70 or 60 or above that cause what im thinking is blizzard wont let you have that stuff but alas i cannot prove it and it is only a theory but it could happen</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>52720</b></h3>After getting this tabard, I have to say I'm not too impressed. Kidding, I know as well as everyone that it's purely for the &quot;I have this and you don't&quot; effect. It might be nice though to give it the effect to make you neutral to the scarlets when you're wearing it though. After all, they think as one quest put it &quot;that any person not wearing their tabard has been tainted by the scourge&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nicklaus32780</b></h3>if your a warrior with the Scarlet Chestpiece you dont need this because the tabard is attached to the armor</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I finally got me one of these on my level 60 rogue. It took me around 15 runs, but I think it's been worth the annoyance, it looks great.<br /><br />Plus I got about four of each of Herod's drops, along with a couple of Ravagers or whatever they're called. Good for disenchanting :D</div>

I go in the Armory, kill some things and half way through was able just to run past mobs, killed Herod, helm dropped, Trainies came running down, pwnd them, and the first loot was the talbard :) I was happy ^^ First run, first loot.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Saw these appearing on my server, got envious, looked up where they dropped (Exactly where, I wasn't going to clear SM mindlessly hoping for one), and farmed Herod 6 times.<br /><br />4 Shoulders, 1 Berserker Helm, and a Ravager later, I walked out of the Armory with a bag full of shards and my head held high, looking like a Crusader.<br /><br />The Horde group going in spotted me and said, &quot;Bet we can kill him.&quot;<br /><br />I said, &quot;osht, I'm in crappy gear for a 1 vs. 5, even though they are only 40.&quot;<br /><br />Ravager tore them up more or less, and when they made a break for Graveyard's portal, I sped them up with a stun and a swing of TUF. GG<br /><br />Oh, and then I did a slow RP walk into the GY for the drama of it. XD<br /><br />Of course, I couldn't resist coming back out and doing the fight again. :D<br /><br />Anyway, the drop isn't too bad, and I was suprised how easy Herod was. How do any groups wipe on him? His BLADES OF LIGHT! are a &quot;Back off and bandage/heal&quot; break. Easy ^&amp;*! man. Not to mention, I then went to GY and fought the new boss in it (Scorn, interesting drop off him, a necklace that rivaled Triune Amulet.), got a Zealot Blade in a chest, and wound up with a total of 80-110 G between drops, cash on bodies, and shards.<br /><br />This baby was worth it, and btw, as long as you avoid the pats, you only have to fight around 4-6 mobs, including Herod, not including the Initiates.<br /><br />Lol, good fun. FOR THE CRUSADE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My brother and I on Kilrogg (horde side) each got this tabard today on the same run.</div>

It's BOP, and unique. So, no, they couldn't have it. Also, I WTF PWN3D Herod. Don't need to back off during the Blades of Light stuff, you just... need a healer, tops. I was in my krazzzy crit gear. 25.55% Chance to crit. In Beserkers Stance. Yes, I'm a Warrior, so, ya know, that MIGHT be why I took so little damage. :-P Prot Speced, too. Anyways, yeah. Go in with people that NEED to do the stuff in there, anyways. It's nicer to them, and it's more fun over all. Don't just be a selfish..... loser. Share the glory, share the wealth, dibs the tabbard before it drops. :-P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This still drops. I got mine about a month or so ago.<br /><br />Too bad it's just for looks.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Pretty cool tabard if you don't like your Guild Tabard or you arent a big fan of the PvP ones. However, after a while it got old staring at a piece of cloth with a red blotch on it, especially since almost <i>everyone </i> between level 37 and 50 has it. I've found it easier to just go without a tabard, but it's still nice to have it if you want to look like one of the Scarlet dudes.<br /><br />And a quick comment on the Scarlet Armor set:<br /><br />It's a really nice armor set for Warriors and Paladins, especially Warriors considering all the strength and stamina buffs involved, however once you hit 40 (which is not very far away) and you can use plate, lots of new and better armor pieces will be popping up, so I'd just give my advice to hold back and not put so much effort into getting all the Scarlet stuff before you know what else might come along after you can wear plate.<br /><br />Just my opinion, do as you choose...</div>

Tip for shortening fighting time - when the Trainee's run in, set your pet to Aggressive, feign death and run up to the top level - once they've surrounded your pet, simply Volley them and go on a looting spree!<br /><br /><a href="http://i13.tinypic.com/47sr1p1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Pic</a></div>

I go in the Armory, kill some things and half way through was able just to run past mobs, killed Herod, helm dropped, Trainies came running down, pwnd them, and the first loot was the talbard :) I was happy ^^ First run, first loot. Was very easy to solo, I'm a fury warrior with some points in arms.</div>

It took me about 10 runs to get it but a guildmate got another on our next run. Make sure you loot all of their bodies, its a white item thats Bind on Pickup but does not trigger a pop-up window so make sure you don't shift-click the body if you're running it for a friend.</div>

I got the set in a month, it takes time to get it all, so be patient. The picture includes: Herods shoulder, Raging berserkers helm, Aegis of the scarlet commander, sword of serenity, chain of the scarlet crusade set, tabard of the scarlet crusade and a red linen shirt. Enjoy, and good luck! =)<br /><br />For the Scarlet Crusade!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I ran on both my 60 hunter and my 57 rogue. I got 2 drops out of a total of 319 loots. Not sure why the odd number because I looted everything, but that's what mobinfo counted. Was easy on my hunter and I hardly took any damage. Here's how I beat him on my rogue:<br /><br />Currently spec'd 26/22/0<br />open with garrote, instantly used evade, rack up a full 5 combo and do expose armor, wait for the blade flurry (at this point, I usually take very minimal damage), rack up another 5 combo points, cold blood eviscerate (around 2300 damage thanks to expose armor), then just rack up as many combo points as necessary to finish him off.<br /><br />Tips! <br />-Run away from his &quot;Blades of Light&quot;<br />-Take a health potion in case you take a bit too much damage<br />-expose armor is really helpful (takes a level 40 down to about nothing I reckon)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>16 runs.. no drop :( hate to wait <br /><br />&quot;You have entered too many instances lately&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>done 22 runs now and still no tabard... LAME!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me 9 runs solo to get it as a 21/30 Holy Priest... The drop rate posted here looks very very low but it might be counting kills on the Trainees back before they dropped the Tabard thus lowering the average.<br /><br />I could make it through to Herod only killing a few mobs here and there. You can use Mind Control to split some of the mobs apart that are tied together like the first 2 you run into... Or get some free damage done while you regen mana. I also used Mind Control when a mob got to about 20% health to keep them from running and aggroing more buddies... Just put on Shadow Word : Pain and hold them in place while they die. You'll want to be getting to Herod as quick as possible since it will probably take a few runs and runners pulling mobs mean more wasted time.<br /><br />If you are crafty with your Mind Soothes you can get to Herod only fighting maybe 4-5 guys but as a raid specced healbot it was more like 10 cause I would always end up snagging one or three by mistake. Make sure you mana burn the palidens and the only problems you might face is the Myrmidons since they can cancel a school school of magic... so 2 on you at once it is safer to just Shield, Renew and Wand since you dont wanna risk being caught with no spells to use...<br /><br />I have some pretty good mana regen so in tough times getting busted soothing in a packed hallway and having to chain fight 15 guys without a mana break due to runners I still wouldn't get offed even though they hit pretty fast in packs...<br /><br />The Zig Zag hallways you can actually bust straight down the center and split the difference without aggroing... as long as you watch for the patrols and duck to the side when they come...<br /><br />Herod is no problem... just dont be a dummy and stand in his blade of light attack... I found myself only getting in one Mind Blast and one Smite before he went immune again... with some practice I would have a Holy Fire winding up to hit right as he came out of spinny mode. 4 helms, 3 pants, 1 shoulder, 1 ravager later... The tabard dropped.<br /><br />As long as you have enough mana for one Holy Nova ya can drop all of the trainees at once... But even a wand or staff knock can take em down...<br /><br />If they dont drop it I sometimes would run back out and reset the instance... or just get naked and die and res quicker than trying to ninja sneak your way back out. Save some bag space for your gear and all the silk yer gonna walk out with... <br /><br />Good Luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My earlier post isn't showing to me (strange...), but in response to it I'd like to confirm that this thing DOES drop after all. Dropped for me after a good 25 runs. No joke, I counted. Not to mention I was running it so fast that I kept getting the &quot;You have entered too many instances lately&quot; error. :) So if you want it hard enough, just keep trying. It's evilly rare, but you CAN get it. And now my rogue in Volcanic Armor looks sexy. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>No0bT4rD</b></h3>I am 38 runs into this farm in classic WoW. Still no drop. I've heard the drop rate is 0.6% for each trainee. 20 trainees spawn per run. So that means that the chance of me not having obtained this tabard by now is (0.994^20)^38=1%. Meaning that after 38 Herod kills, 99% of people should have seen the tabard drop at least once. I am the one percent.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zGruBz</b></h3>I farmed this for 5 hours straight (from midnight to 5 in the morning) and just as I was about to quit... the tabard drops.
