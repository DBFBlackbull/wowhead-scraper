Great drop rate, along with Heart of Fire and Elemental Fire.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8004</b></h3>confirming nicksap, Un'goro is a great place to farm these. watch out for members of the opposite faction, a lot of people farm here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8029</b></h3>Aye, I didn't like the place myself, but teh place is rather excellent to farm Essence of Fires. I really don't need them except maybe for money.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skitzosmeagol</b></h3>Fire Plume Ridge is where these drop alot, off the fire elementals. Yes there is usually alliance here :) no worries for those PVE servers. I farm here all the time for these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kreghx</b></h3>this drops pretty often if you look at other essences</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8722</b></h3>I don't know how readable this will be but here's a little diagram of the transmute circle that is possible with elemental essences. The main circle is Earth to Water to Air to Fire and back to Earth. The two branches are Life to Earth to Life and Water to Undeath to Water.<br /><br />Life</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I killed combined about 200 Living Blaze and Scorching Elementals.&nbsp; Got 4 in total so far.&nbsp; Roughly a <b>2% drop rate in Un'goro crater.</b>&nbsp; Selling for about 12G on my server.&nbsp; Use is high for Firey weopon enchant.&nbsp; Never once seen a Un'goro Char that is supposed to be dropped. Tons of Burning Pitch, some Element of fire and Heart of fire.&nbsp; 4 Green Item drops.&nbsp; Armor only 52 level stuff.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Essence of Fire are going for about 10g a piece on Shadowsong server Alli AH.&nbsp; I'm also farming this for my robe...been at it 3 days now (approximately 8 hours) and have picked up 7 so far.&nbsp; Drop rate is not bad, but having a bunch of people in the same place farming at the same time makes it difficult to find very many of them.<br /><br />I will farm another night and if I don't get the rest, I'll probably just buy them---I'm impatient.&nbsp; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Farming for Essence of Fire today at Fire Plume Ridge in Un'Goro.&nbsp; About 42 kills netted the following:<br /><br />4 Essence of Fire<br />4 Elemental Fire<br />2 Heart of Fire<br />Ornate Circlet of the Wolf (Mail, lvl 54)<br />Traveler's Bracers (Leather, lvl 51)<br />Plans:&nbsp; Wildthorn Mail <br />Mithril Lockbox (contents TBD)<br />Tons of coal and burning pitch<br /><br />The going rate for Essence of Fire at Alliance AH was a minimum of 7g and I need 4 for my new sword, so I thought I'd give it a try.&nbsp; The rest of the mats have run about 35g and I'm fortunate that a guildee will craft the weap free of charge....but anyway, grinding was well worth it!&nbsp; About 3 - 3.5 hours work with an excellent ROI.&nbsp; Good luck.<br /><br />Naralanna, Shadow Dragon Knights, Elune</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Either the drop rate was really reduced or everyone is having incredibly bad luck.&nbsp; Logged 264 kills at Fire Plume Ridge and found 5 which puts it at roughly a 2% drop rate which is well below what it use to be.<br />Previously, I could get about 4 in 2 hours.&nbsp; Now you're lucky if you even get 1 per hour.&nbsp; I once went 2 1/2 hours without a single Essence of Fire drop...yes, very irritating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>me and a friend were farming here and 12 dropped in an hour and a half</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Decided to start farming for my robe of the void mats early, have everything but the fire essences already. After one hour of farming at fire plume as a lvl 53 destro lock, results are:<br /><br />2x essence of fire<br />2x heart of fire<br />6x elemental fire<br />2x boe greens<br /><br />coal, core of elements and burning pitch's, all vendor trash<br /><br />at this rate itll take me roughly 6 hrs+ to get all 12 essences, but im lvl 53 so its basically grinding aswell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I play on the Talnivarr (EU) server, and here there is about 20 on AH at all times, people here know its worth cash.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farm for the things i need, i always get bad luck and farmed for a whole day and not even 1 dropped, im always ended up with buying off AH with my epic mount cash, buying it is so outta the question for this case, cuz it sells for like 12-16g each, and an idiot was sell 20 of em for 8k of gold, GL with that. Im in the hoamarush server, ne 1 know y i get this bad luck all the time?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im a lvl51 mage and i have been able to kill these since 48 from what i've noticed the droprate is very random, one day i can farm there for hours and get nothing the next day i get a essence of fire almost everyguy( well not every guy but it seems like it :D )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah... I've killed 486 scorching elentals and living blazes. have 8 (essences) so far... Water was SO much easier.<br /><br />Think i'll buy the last two ;)<br /><br />Fortunatly i've made almost 100g on vendor trash and mountain silversage while farming for essences.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>did 1 brd run (solo) in like 30 mins with my 70 rogue and got 4 essences. killed almost all fire elementals there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I actually got two of them in felwood from entropic horrors, i think i killed like 9 of them.&nbsp; I think i just got really really lucky, but if you're passing through felwood take a scenic route and kill a few horrors, who knows maybe you'll get lucky too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>On the PTR server this evening I killed 20 fire elementals at the Skald area in Blades Edge Mountains, just to do small test on drop rates. Recieved 2 Essence of Fire and 7 Mote of fire. At this point its approximately 10% drop rate for the essences and approximately 35% drop rate for the motes of fire. So now I gonna hold my breath and see if these drop rates remain consistant when the patch goes live.<br /><br />Happy hunting to all.&nbsp; :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wow, it took like 20 min for one essence of fire but heck im selling to for 10g im happy :)&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Farmed for approx 3 hours and have got 3 essence's.&nbsp; Drop rate is still about 2%.&nbsp; What a pain... but well worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>One dropped for me off of a blazing invader. I was just trying to kill it so i can get to a few living blaze and it dropped. I dont know the drop rate killed about 70 things there total, but only a few invaders just to get around there. Saw one in AH for 35g screw that!<br /><br />Had to edit because i just got a second one from a blazing invader.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i killed 10 blazing elementals and got 4 of em dunno if its just the patch or im just lucky</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just killed my first blaze with my warrior.... and a Heart of Fire, Essence of Fire, and Green shoulderpads dropped.&nbsp; I didn't even think 2 greens were possible after killing a mob. :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was just wondering the same...Will there be a transmute available soon or something?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok so i was happy cause i got 18 of them in an hour and a half, i thought they solf for 12g each.<br /><br />they now only sell for 4 each but this still is a fair amount of gold</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im lvl 68, and wanted some money i got to Un'Goro to farm essence of fire guess what, i get 11 in 5mins what the hell is going on is the drop rate increased or am i super lucky?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This dropped pretty good off the fire elementals on the fire plume ridge in un'goro...if u have the ungoro ash quest it is a good way to farm and quest at the same time<br /><br />:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just got in the un goro crater ad they droped 2 essence of fire in 10-15 mins so its a good drop rate (for me atleast and i`m usaly not that lucky)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>let me reestate what i said the drop rate has changed or something i find 1 essence of fire out of every 3 kills they must have changed the drop rate</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Was at Fire Plume Ridge last night in Un'goro, got 4 in 15mins then another 2 within the hour. You can farm 20+ before any eating d/time if u have the FR gear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>is ther any where a level 32 could get these?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just farmed in un'goro last night and was pretty lucky ;P<br /><br />I farmed 10 in 1 hour. Must be a record for me :D<br />U dont need FR gear to farm them. I did it with only my MotW. and a felhide<br />cap which gives 8FR more.. Easy to farm if ya ask me :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I tried out the camp in Felwood and its horrible. Finally went to Un'Goro for the 2nd one I needed and got it pretty fast. Better drop rate there and you don't have the annoying roaming elites to deal with.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farming these for my Robe of the Archmage and +30 spell power enchant, I noticed an odd drop rate in Un'Goro. There is one elemental spawn point that has dropped an essence 4 times for me. I got 1/4 of my essences from this one spawn. If you go from the north/east side of Fire Plume up the ramp, across the bridge and up a little more, he's on a hill to your right. You could just get him from the ground, going up that mound. I think that he's worth killing every time you go by, just because the drops on that spawn seem to be bugged. I may just be being superstitious, but it's worth the 20 seconds to kill it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>guys ive been farming for like 20 min got 2 so far im a lvl 61 shaman making it alot easier, im an encahnter, and i wanted to do the enchant on my own wep but didnt want to pay lol so i farmed<br /><br />it is awesme to farm them because beleive it or not on raelm Nazjatr the core of elemets which have like a 90% drop rate are worth like 12g a stack and elemental fire's worth like 9g the point is farm un goro and u can make alot of money!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Havent got a single one of these in ungoro this far, a travelers backpack and a hurricane dropped though but not a single essence</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just bought 10 of these at the AH for 20G... . Let's see what profit i can make on this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>IDK, the drops seem to vary, one time i spent 2 hours and got 5 essences, and today i spend about 1.5-2hrs, and turned up completely dry. I also had a travelers backpack drop for me, which was pretty awesome.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Farming the Fire Ele's in Un'Goro is great cause you get nice beefy drops like these! <br /><br />Sought after by many many ppl</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Un'Goro is the place to farm, in a 5 hour period I walked away with 10 of these. <br />Seems to me that the Blazing Invaders have a higher drop rate than the rest, I think I had like a 12% drop rate on them.<br /><br />And for some reason, after farming that area for a few hours, the Blazing Invaders stopped spawning. I didn't see one for 3 hours and I was the only one farming that area o.o</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Fire Elementals in Un'Goro do it for me.<br /><br />The last two times I grinded there I pulled 12 away (8 in a 12 hour session, then 4 in a 2.5 hour session, different character). But I also got in terms of notable drops:<br /><br />two traveler's backpacks<br />an Eye of Adaegus<br /><a href="/classic/item=5266/eye-of-adaegus">Eye of Adaegus</a> a Dark Phantom Cape<br /><a href="/classic/item=13122/dark-phantom-cape">Dark Phantom Cape</a> addition to many hearts of fire/elemental fire. A decent amount of greens drop (4% rate according to mobinfo-2, which includes the essences)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Invaders are part of a &quot;World event&quot; that different elements invade different zones, but don't wreak any havoc. They leave after awhile.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ah, the human brain tend to try to see patterns but it's pretty unbelievable if they changed the droprate on the certain spawn.</div>
