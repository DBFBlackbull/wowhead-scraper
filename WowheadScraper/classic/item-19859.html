But it is not a one handed weapon, it is a two-handed axe. But that has very little to do with this knife and where it might do the most damage and therefore the most good.\nThe hunter vs rogue war has gone on a long time, we both love our attack power, our crit gear and our agi. But in looking at weapons, we have to keep in mind where it's greatest use comes in.\nFor a weapon, the damage dealt from physically attacking with it is most important. As a rogue, the dmg on this knife is quite high for ambushes and backstabs, and a more realistic end game weapon for someone who's not made high-warlord or raided MC and downed Ragnaros.\nWhen a hunter lusts for this weapon, it's for the some of the same reasons that a rogue does. The stats are great! :) I wouldn't be outraged if a hunter had this, it would be an excellent addition (stat-wise) to the dmg his bow\/gun does on his ranged attacks. But at the same time, a hunter would primarily want this for it's stats in reference to his ranged attacks, meaning it'd be more like a hand-held scope (increasing bow\/gun damage but not doing much in it's \"knife\" form.)\nIt works the other way, too. My guild raids Mc weekly. Say we kill magmadar and he drops this: [item=17069] This is a great bow. It has chance to hit and atk power, and it's got excellent dps. Any hunter without his hunter quest epic bow would spend his dkp on it. That having been said, I would like one [b]some day[\/b]. Once the 6-7 hunters who regularly come to our raids had this or the hunter epic, I would go in on it. But my wanting it would be like a hunter wanting this dagger. I wouldn't be after it for it's use to me as a bow... merely for it's stats in reference to my melee attack.\nAnyone who can equip an item can probably find a way to make use of it... But what's important is to know when something is a primary equip (tank gear for warriors, bows\/guns for hunters, etc.) item which would majorly effect their usefulness as a member of the raid, and when it's something that you'd like because it (as a secondary equip) increases your usefulness in the raid.\n\nEdited, Thu Sep 15 22:11:55 2005","date":"2005-09-16T00:06:58-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Fosley","importedSubject":"Misleading?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":85,"id":3078652,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"[quote]as a hunter I want this no not to piss off rogues,  its because this and the main hand warblad of the hakkari 28 atk power 1 percent to crit ARE THE BEST POSSIBLE WEAPON COMBO WE CAN HAVE. if you dont like it tell blizz to make a +45 agi enchant that can only be used on 2handers.[\/quote]\n\nI agree with you, as a rogue myself I think hunters are allowed to roll on Warblades of hakkeri, but one thing, this dagger is not a part of the warblades of hakkeri, its just a dagger.\nHunters please stop saying you want this, get the set with the warblades of hakkeri instead, it really owns, much better than this dagger.\nLet the rogues have this, then you can roll on those 2 epics swords","date":"2005-09-16T08:13:01-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I think you miss the point.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7069</b></h3>This dagger is both a valid upgrade for Rogues and Hunters.<br /><br />The +crit and +AP are beneficial for both classes, but is ultimately better placed in the hands of a Rogue if that Rogue is only using Rare weapons.<br /><br />As is mentioned above though, this dagger is dwarfed by Perdition's Blade, which is a much better dagger if it is available.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7359</b></h3>Its also a valid upgrade for warriors, id give it to a fury warrior before I give it to a hunter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DJTyrant</b></h3>This is a really great dagger to pick up for rogues (mostly) but hunters and warriors can find great use for this also. I still have it as my main hand dagger and get pretty nice DPS out of it. If you're not able to run MC/BWL this is definetly worth picking up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stellas</b></h3>As a lot of people have said before, this one together with warblade of the hakkari mainhand is a killer combo, and i already have the warblade so... <br /><br />The thing is, if it drops i roll for it with some rogues and warriors. If i will win it, no biggie... if i lose, no biggie neither. <br /><br />When i read the comments on items i get the impression that a lot of you people are only interessed in your personal gear, while you know that to do instances like ZG, AQ, MC and upwards require a good team of players, who all have their strenghts and weaknesses... <br /><br />What are you going to do when your whole guild is in good gear, except for you warriors and you start mc? Nothing... What would your raid be without the hunters doing some dps in ony phase 2 and other bossfights, what would you be without those good rogues meleeing the heck out of those same mobs and bosses? Nothing. <br />We all want to improve ourselves, we all wanna benefit and we all expect to get something nice after 5-6 hours of raiding, but the thing is, it aint always possible. Let people who need it grab it. Its a good off-hand weapon for hunters also. But give it to a rogue or someone who really needs it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9540</b></h3>I just got this a few days ago. As a rogue this is now my main hand dagger with the Electrified Dagger in my offhand until I can get the honor to buy a Grand Marshal's Dirk. I have to say this is a huge improvement in backstab damage over the Electrified Dagger. <br /><br />My chance to crit is now 26.25% with my talents upping the chance for backstab crits even more. I regularly hit cloth wearers in pvp for 1000+ now causing them to drop pretty fast. Isn't that what rogues are for? I am also doing pretty good raid damage and have switched to backstab over sinister strike as my main combo point attack. I have to be careful not to draw too much threat now though with all the dps I'm throwing down. I can't wait for the Grand Marshal's Dirk in main hand and Fang of the Faceless in off-hand...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Seriously doubt that a regular PuG could do Hakkar... Possibly if there were several MC/BWL people in the raid as well...but otherwise, no. Hakkar himself is not that hard, id say Marli, Arlokk, Thekal, and Jindo all are tougher than Hakkar... Each of those bosses taking us many tries over a couple weeks to bring them down, then on our first week of killing all the priests, clearing to Hakkar, then killing him on our 2nd try...not that difficult. But our raid is a guild raid that also does MC successfully. PuG's getting past these bosses without some sort of regular weekly attendance just doesnt sound possible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The simple fact remains that if a hunter wants +1% crit and an attack power bonus, there are many other items in the game that are less &quot;controversial&quot; and more easily attained.<br /><br />Had this item been a *sword*, I would have more sympthy toward hunters wanting the item.&nbsp; However, this item is a __dagger__, and rogue talents will allow them to hit for large multiples of the base damage value of this weapon.<br /><br />Whereas a hunter could use this item to squeeze a few more dmg points out of an aimed shot and increase baseline dps, a rogue can backstab for 1500+ and ambush in the 2000+ range.&nbsp; For your average shanker wielding rogue, the benefits of upgrading to this weapon are significantly higher than they are for a hunter.&nbsp; There is absolutely no denying this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As with any high end weapon (both melee and ranged), those classes whose PRIMARY ATTACK comes from that slot should be given first opportunity to roll..<br /><br />Example:&nbsp; Hunter - Primary Attack RANGED dps<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rogue - Primary Attack MELEE (1h dw) dps<br /><br />There are a handful of end-game rifles or bows that have excellent +stats for rogues (atk power, crit, etc) ~ and sure, as a rogue i wouldnt mind getting one.&nbsp; But there is no way in hell that, as a rogue, i would roll on say, a Gurubashi Dwarf Destroyer (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=51820">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=51820</a>) for the extra +30 atk power if there was a hunter who needed a PRIMARY WEAPON upgrade.&nbsp; As I would hope that a hunter would respect the same for a rogue if this dagger drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Very good for rogues.<br /><br />Decent for Hunters, although the Twin warblades of the Hakkari would be better.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>As it happens, warblade of the hakkari mainhand and fotf is the best hunter combo in the game excluding Naxx and AQ40.&nbsp; So either you roll on this as a rogue and replace it in MC and BWL or roll on it as a hunter and raid with it for a long, long time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This weapon is very versatile. However, rogues imo should definately have first priority for this item over any other class. This truly is one of the best offhand weapons for hunters though, and can also be used with a fury warrior. Great weapon!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Let me tell you how things roll in my guild, and yes, we do BWL on a regular basis, so the possibility of the Dragonfang Blade or Claw of the Black Drake dropping into my lap passes me frequently.<br /><br />Our guild likes to help out people who have just starting their raiding careers frequently, so we still go to ZG, AQ20, and Molten Core a lot (but M-F we do BWL).&nbsp; And for the case of new players in our guild, we realize that with our DKP system that the best weapons dropping in BWL will go to those who have played the longest in our guild, those who are the veterans.&nbsp; The newest members however, need good gear to be able to succeed in these higher-end raids, so we stick to these rules very clearly.<br /><br /><ul><li>- If a dagger Rogue has crap daggers, and Fang of the Faceless drops, that Rogue has priority of bidding on the dagger.<br /></li><li>- If a Gurubashi Dwarf Destroyer drops, and a Hunter has a Green &quot;...of the Falcon/Monkey&quot; for a ranged weapon, by all means, they get priority.<br /></li><li>- If the Warblades of the Hakkari drop (any half) and a Fury Warrior or Sword Rogue there should have a need for them, by all means, it's their game (yes, our guild distincts between Dagger Rogues and Sword Rogues, dependant on Talent build).</li></ul><br /><br />The ONLY time Hunters or Warriors are allowed to bid on the Fang of the Faceless is when there are no Rogues present who would benefit from having the dagger (ie, they allready have it or have something better).&nbsp; <br /><br />To assume that it's a terrible waste to not let Hunters have priority on this dagger because &quot;Rogues will get a Perd blade/Dragonfang in 1 month so it'll be VTd lol&quot; is just plain ignorant, because they're obviously ignoring the factors that goes into getting a Perdition's blade or Core Hound Tooth.&nbsp; First off (taking Perdition's as example), you get one shot of Perdition's blade dropping a week.&nbsp; What if only two out of 8 Rogues have Perdition's blade, and you're at the bottom of the pecking order in the Rogues?&nbsp; Then you have to take into account the abysmal drop rate of the dagger, 17% (if not less).&nbsp; That's not one month, that's at least THREE months, if not more.<br /><br />To tell a Rogue to not roll on a dagger that would be a huge upgrade for them while they're still struggling to get decent raiding gear is like telling a new level 60 Hunter to &quot;stuffu&quot; when a Blastershot Launcher drops and go get <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Lok'delar,%20Stave%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Keepers">Lok'delar, Stave of the Ancient Keepers</a> instead because the Rogues/Warriors present want the 1% increase to crit.&nbsp; Exactly how is an undergeared Hunter going to conjure up all the Sinew and drop three Elite level 60 Demons solo and without pets just so they can get that staff and bow?&nbsp; Does anyone contemplate that maybe -- just maybe -- the other Hunters in the guild who are further on in the quest chain or even HAVE the petrified leaf won't exactly roll over and let that newbie hunter have the Mature Black Dragon Sinew when it drops from Onyxia?&nbsp; No, they're at the bottom of pecking order again, hanging out with the Rogue with their Barman Shanker and Frightalon talking about how they're kinda abused in the way that their gear are so somewhat... interchangably good.<br /><br />So am I saying Hunters should never get this dagger?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I'm saying that if there's a dagger Rogue there with weaker daggers in the group, they really need to get priority, especially since a Rogue's success in being a melee DPS is dependant on the strength of their weapons.&nbsp; And for good measure, the Gurubashi Dwarf Destroyer should go to a Hunter before it becomes a Rogue or Warrior's &quot;ranged pulling trinket&quot;.<br /><br />That's how my guild functions, anyways.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Probably not its good for a hunter but a rogue without a better dagger should get it more decent for warriors too but seeing as the twin blades of the hakkari drop here this should be left to rogues</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>my guild has ZG on DKP, i am saving enought dkp to roll on it since its a better upgrade for me than any of our rogues that are 8/8 tier2.<br /><br />for hunters this is more like a trinket, but it is worth, get 2 good weapns enchant them with +15 agility and you will get a lot more DPS than any hunter you see around.<br /><br />last time it droped it was for 1 of our hunters, and no1 of the rogues cryed, i mean, why would they do that if we have cleared almost all AQ40 and they will get an even better weapon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so lets see here.... rogues are allowed to be out rolled by hunters y? because we might get a better weapon soon that hunters will roll on again?<br /><br />plus hunters say this all the time then roll on a weapon whose only bonus is Chance on Hit to do +100 shadow damage or so and sometimes roll on the other things just because they see its epic<br /><br />i would pass on a bow to any hunter and expect them to leave my daggers alone.. but do they? naw they wanna use it because it has an extra +5 ap then their old one<br /><br />and i dont see how a hunter i can see anything bout rolling over a dagger rogue... which i am and ya know daggers arent that important for me.. they just are what i attack with</div>

ALL MELEE sucks now. Its so sad to see such a great game do something so stupid like this to ruin it 4 all (melee), it was almost unbelievable when i saw what they had done. <br /><br />I have the Empyrean Demolisher it was the best sinister strike weapon on the game other than pvp reward weapons that is, and now has become a P.O.S. Even pvp reward weapons are trash now b/c they are 2 slow between sinister strike half of the beauty was the slow speed bouns, and now the only thing good about them is the high dps. Faster weapons are the best now b/c all weapons are locked on the same speed for the special moves SO GHEY. <br /><br />THERE IS NO DEPTH TO THE GAME ANYMORE <br /><br />So bottom line is we will never hit the high crits and dps like we once did this is such BS. Today was a sad day =*( <br /><br />world of warcraft can kiss my _ _ _ guess its back to DAoC 4 me. <br /><br />When i say no DEPTH i mean on weapon selection. All anyone is going to try 4 now is the fastest weapon they can get their hands on to only come up short of what we once did. B4 if u were another class u would want the fast weapon like a hunter now we will all be going for the fast weapons with the most dps and the slow ones have no use. The slow speed bonus is no more that means no DEPTH and we have been GIMPED. plz dont be a sheep stand up 4 something. We did not deserve a nerf of any sort we already were not the damage dealers (ROGUES) as we were suppose to be as defined in the book. <br /><br />In conclusion BLIZZARD should have fixed the blue weapons that were causing the prob and left the system how it was. <br /><br />Edited, Fri Nov 4 12:57:41 2005</div>

Mmmh, moist.<br /><br />And if I were a hunter, I would roll on this. That's the point of rolling. There's always a little bit of greed in with the need, unless you just wouldn't use the item. <br /><br />This is a 1 hand item with higher DPS than the 2 hand polearm from the new Hunter quest. I'm a crit build hunter, which means that a) I want 1 hand crit items and b) Sometimes, aggro shifts to me. A really fast dagger, with + crit? Are you serious? Can I have 2 of 'em? <br /><br />I would roll on it, in case I was being too subtle. And if someone else in my party got it, good. <br /><br />Actually, I'm lvl 51... If a priest rolled on it I would be happy for him. I've never even seen an epic drop. Everyone should get a chance at glory. He may not be able to use the dagger, but I'm sure he could trade it for something really nice-like. Should he be penalized for the item dropping not being suited to him? Items are part of the reason we're out there, all of the reason for some. And if it's not a guild built party, then everyone should have a chance at the epics, rares, etc.<br /><br />Ok, enough rambling. I hope I'm in a party with 2 rogues and win that. Or it at least goes to the healer.<br /><br />///Edit///<br />I know that was disorganized, but on these boards I'm sure I'm above par.<br />Also, I know I can't have 2 of 'em, it being unique and all.

Let me fill you in with what rogues get to use... Daggers. thats it... If you want backstab and ambush, you have to use daggers.<br /><br />Now a hunter can use. dagger, swords, axes, polarms, 2h axes, 2 handed swords. Melee isnt even your primary attack position.<br /><br />So if you see any swords with the same sort of stats, i would gladly let you roll for it. If you want more crit, get them double axes from UD strath, and stick +15 agility on them. THEY are hunter weapons, this is a ROGUE weapon.<br /><br />So stop crying at every single drop, just because you can use it.</div>

Hunters and rogues look for exactly the same stats on weapons. Sure I'd let this go to a rogue before I had a chance at it but it's a very nice dagger for hunters as well. Hunters, when they can't find agility/stamina on a weapon or decide they have enough elsewhere go for +crit % and attack power every time. Last time I checked the only agility on my barbarous blade was what I put there with the + 15 enchant. It's a nice weapon and people who like the colour purple are gonna want it.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Sep 17 05:43:00 2005</div>

I don't give a crap whether you roll on a mace/sword, because anyone has a great use for those. But rogues have abilities that REQUIRE DAGGERS, and makes that weapon damage you see there up to 5x more powerful (not including the double crit bonus). Just get Krol Blade, Assassination, or even brutality! If there's one thing that should be predominant to rogues, it's a slow dagger. End of story.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ALRIGHT wazdakka... first of all your lvl 51 meaning you dont have a good guild and you will be running this pickup group. Especially if anyone in your server reads this forum you will definately NOT get a good guild. A pickup group will not reach Hakkar for MONTHS! it would be like a pickup group trying to kill Domo or Rag in MC... if they could even get to them they would fail horribly! Second of all if you were EVER to roll for this item in the presence of a rogue you would be immediately banned from the group and your name would spread as a ninja whether you got the item or not. You say this is THE best item you could possibly get... well YOUR WRONG! dual bone slicing hatchets with +15 agility enchant PWN THIS THING! thats +56 agility from your 2 weapons... thats 1% crit and +56 RAP. Now your thinking... thats 2 weapons and im getting the same % crit. With new hunter talents they can boost that by approx. 15-20 agility im not sure of the exact %. Now that means 15-20 MORE RAP as well as about .5% more crit. I have afriend who is a hunter using those as well as other Agility strong items.. Unbuffed he has 467 agility. Now dont give me this crap that, this dagger is a viable hunter item... it ISNT! im not worried however because you will probably never get this item. If it took you this long to hit lvl 51 it will take you another month at least to hit 60 and then another 5 to find a group and clear ZG</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Oooookkk....From what I've seen, it's an issue between it being a rogue mainhand (for ambushes and backstabs) and a hunter offhand. What would be the point of this dagger being in the offhand? WEll, it would act as a trinket of sorts, because it would not be used for its damage...Look at the speed and top damage of the dag...Don't you want a faster weapon for your offhand? Why take the 3rd best ambush/BS dagger away from rogues? Compare this to Perdition Blade...They are very similar damgewise, so a Hunter has to ask him/herself: Would you roll against a rogue on Perdition's blade? Sure, that doesn't have the stats that the Fang does, but what such a high powered and slow dagger should be ued for is DAMAGE. IMO, Hunters may roll on it, only if rogues all pass (good luck on that). Using something as a trinket over someone else who would use it as their main offense makes NO SENSE whatsoever.<br /><br />Again, go ahead hunters...but only if the rogues pass.<br /><br />Chalupa - 60 Orc Rogue - Ner'zhul<br /><br />Edited, Wed Sep 28 11:50:55 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I believe that the post below on a &quot;hunter axe&quot; was indicating the <a href="/classic/item=19900/zulian-stone-axe">Zulian Stone Axe</a> that drops. But it is not a one handed weapon, it is a two-handed axe. But that has very little to do with this knife and where it might do the most damage and therefore the most good.<br />The hunter vs rogue war has gone on a long time, we both love our attack power, our crit gear and our agi. But in looking at weapons, we have to keep in mind where it's greatest use comes in.<br />For a weapon, the damage dealt from physically attacking with it is most important. As a rogue, the dmg on this knife is quite high for ambushes and backstabs, and a more realistic end game weapon for someone who's not made high-warlord or raided MC and downed Ragnaros.<br />When a hunter lusts for this weapon, it's for the some of the same reasons that a rogue does. The stats are great! :) I wouldn't be outraged if a hunter had this, it would be an excellent addition (stat-wise) to the dmg his bow/gun does on his ranged attacks. But at the same time, a hunter would primarily want this for it's stats in reference to his ranged attacks, meaning it'd be more like a hand-held scope (increasing bow/gun damage but not doing much in it's &quot;knife&quot; form.)<br />It works the other way, too. My guild raids Mc weekly. Say we kill magmadar and he drops this: <a href="/classic/item=17069/strikers-mark">Striker's Mark</a> This is a great bow. It has chance to hit and atk power, and it's got excellent dps. Any hunter without his hunter quest epic bow would spend his dkp on it. That having been said, I would like one <b>some day</b>. Once the 6-7 hunters who regularly come to our raids had this or the hunter epic, I would go in on it. But my wanting it would be like a hunter wanting this dagger. I wouldn't be after it for it's use to me as a bow... merely for it's stats in reference to my melee attack.<br />Anyone who can equip an item can probably find a way to make use of it... But what's important is to know when something is a primary equip (tank gear for warriors, bows/guns for hunters, etc.) item which would majorly effect their usefulness as a member of the raid, and when it's something that you'd like because it (as a secondary equip) increases your usefulness in the raid.<br /><br />Edited, Thu Sep 15 22:11:55 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As usual it is the Hunter vs. the Rogue debate. I just want to have this cleared...<br /><br />I am both a Rogue and Hunter, lvl 60 both of them and both are raiding ZG/AQ20... so, this is basically how it should be:<br /><br />If you're looking at the stats, which is <u>only</u> what a Hunter should be looking at on melee weapons and Rogue on ranged - especially when other classes can benefit from them - this blade is good for them both yes. But let's not forget what the means of damage is for a Hunter compared to a Rogue.<br /><br />Rogue does damage with melee weapons, hence gets a bigger dps boost from upgrades in that department.<br /><br />Hunter does damage with ranged weapons, hence gets a bigger dps boost from upgrades in that department.<br /><br />Once all Rogues don't get an upgrade from this dagger, Hunters are free to roll on it to get their stat-boost.... exactly as it would have been if the tables were turned, and we were dealing with a ranged weapon with stats that helped a Rogue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>this &quot;omg *insert class here* weapon/armor/trinket/blah blah blah!&quot; crap needs to stop, many items in the game can be used to their full potential by more than 1 class, BUT! hunters are usually not going to get the full potential out of a melee weapon like this. there are TONS more weapons you can use that have stats that are good enough for you. think of it this way, hunters...rogues get 3 weapons to choose from, you get an entire goddamn arsenal...it's not as if we could EVER stand back and attack with a ranged weapon and do nearly the amount of damage we would do with the melee weapons you want to take away because they have atk power or crit on them. i'm sure you'd be just as irritated if a striker's mark or blastershot dropped and all the rogues wanted to bid against you on it. because you would be using it to do your DAMAGE! not just for passive abilites! and i don't care what anyone says, any melee daggers are AIMED AT ROGUES. half of the rogue class is only useable with daggers, does this not make sense to you?<br /><br />btw any of you rogues saying to pretty much stay away from daggers but go ahead and roll on swords are just as bad as the hunters. :P don't forget about your poor sword rogue allies!(that doesn't mean i think all swords should be rogue then hunter, but ones like viskag and BB, yes, rogue before hunter!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have a level 60 hunter and a rogue. This dagger in terms of stats, just looking at the 1% crit and the 28 atk power, both stats are definitely usefull for a hunter or a rogue. But lets look at the weapon stats a little deeper. This dagger's speed is 1.9s. Now in terms of damage calculations out of this dagger with the speed being that low (second slowest dagger in game) this would dish out incredible damage when used with Rogue skills such as Ambush / Backstab. This makes this dagger an ideal mainhand dagger. <br /><br />Now as far as hunters are concerned I urge all of you to look at this:<br /><a href="/classic/item=19865/warblade-of-the-hakkari">Warblade of the Hakkari</a> strongly believe that these 2 swords for the set are WELL suited for hunters / fury Warriors more than any other class. AND the stats of the mainhand is completely the same as the dagger. Also the drop rate is higher for these swords. Think about these points please.<br /><br />Edited, Mon Sep 19 21:21:38 2005</div>
