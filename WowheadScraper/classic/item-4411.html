<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First of all, it does not stack on with other potions. Second of all, it has a FIFTEEN minute cooldown. Only thing I can think this would be good for, is PvP.<br /><br />Do not waste 500g, or whatever ridiculous auction house price, on this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;you're looking at 831 runs for a 95% chance to see this drop.&nbsp; Which is slightly painful.&quot;<br /><br />Not sure how you worked this one out. If the drop rate is 0.4% as indicated by thottbot, then if you run 1000 times, you can (on average) expect this drop 4 times. Therefore you would be expecting to run gnomer around 250 times before this drops.<br /><br />I would love this, simply for the fact it's so hard to get if nothing else. But ouch, 250 times...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well once you get the workshop key it takes less than 15 minutes to get to the last boss.&nbsp; I'm sure a rogue/druid could do it in less time.&nbsp; As level 60 there are about 3 mobs you have to kill to get to him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been farming since december and it dropped this morning. Its best to pop after a potion runs out. It does have a 15 min cool down but in reality your really only using it at bosses so it isnt to big a problem</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Rarity of these schematics are insane. A half a chance of Thermaplugg? That brings the AH Price to a level over its worth, and its almost imposible to get it yourself. Most of the groups going in Gnomeragon don't even make it to the end anyway!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm a 60 rogue i can kill the boss once every 8 mins and i dont have to kill anyone to get to him, i run him 15-25 times a day for the last 4 months, still no Flame Deflector, just for fun lets do the math so i average 20 kills a day over 4 months, so lets say 120 dayss 20*120=2400, so for me at least thats a &gt;0.008% drop rate... :'(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just got this from some noob who didn't know its value for 1g on the Dunemaul Alliance AH<br /><br />I'm making the item for 4g per now, if anyone wants.&nbsp; <br />Kavalier 60 Pally<br /><br />To the guy above me, I feel your pain, I've been farming gnomer for almost a year for this recipe</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After killing Thermaplugg 317 times, he finally dropped it for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I want to know if this still exists or not cause if not I reall don't want to keep farming it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wel it was my first run rite. well anyway it drops, everyone greeds, and i get it. Im not an engineer so i sell it for 5g.......</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>At least you made someone veeeeeeery happy.. <br />:-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Heard some talk about the value of these things and their uses. <br /><br />I am level 300 engineer and have both ice and flame deflector schematics, after I had gotten both (same day) I had guildies throw me flame sacs or w/e they were and frost potions. Made like 3 of each and realized that these are really only good for PvP and if you know your NPC classes, by that I mean what inflicts frost and fire damage like mages and elementals for e.p.<br /><br />For value! these things our worthless! plz trust me fellow engineers and don't waste your time seeking the alchemists for potion or higher level Players for flame sacs, because these things our worthless. I've put these things on AH for a week straight starting at 3g and rapidly dropped the buyouts to a gold flat, and after 2 weeks of 24hr. auctions... nothin! <br /><br />Although this item is very benificial to us engineers. Since it is undesirable I felt no obligation to try to sell it which in result caused me to get used to them and learn which classes of diffrent races use which magic. And for an engineer that actually utilizes this item, is like a taste of the alchemy profession and advantage. Hope I covered some vital questions that would comply with this item. ScagBones</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ill get this schematic on AH .....1.5g :D. Malorne Server.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Better drop of flame sacs from Lethlor Ravine Whelps in Badlands</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Looking for anyone who has ever seen this drop. I would like to confirm that it does infact drop off Mekgineer Thermaplugg and that this isn't a borrowed stat or someones bug. After 60+ runs on Thermal, I can say that the fight isn't terably hard, just getting frustrated.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Apr 5 11:41:09 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got it soloing today second kil :D saved 50g to any1 who wants it just get a high vll friend to helpya or somthing im a lvl 60 lock and i can barely solo it cause of the friggin arcane nullifiers :\ so good luck tryin to get it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Lol! I got this on a random roll, no engineers, now that I see the drop rate I better set up the price accordingly!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah so i found this thing on the auction house and decided to see where it drops at... hence why I am here. But now that i know that it drops off of Mekgineer in Gnomer this is going to suck trying to farm. With such a low drop rate that all the time you invest in trying to get this to drop, seems almost useless. So take it from me, dont ever farm something that you will have to put more time into farming, than you will acually using the item. <br /><br />Unless ofcourse you are one of those people who need to have that particular item just to say you have it. <br /><br />Remember does the Profit &gt; Cost?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I took up enchanting to make a smoking heart, so as a druid i went an ran 3 stealth runs on gnomeregan bosses...this dropped on my first therma kill of the day. I love this little item, great in duels, MC and onyxia(give it to those annoying rogues who are always out of range :P) <br /><br />Jilse- 60 Druid &lt;DIE&gt; on illidan is crafting these, will do for all non-blacklisted alliance</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm not sure where i got this from... i got it on my 50-something at the time hunter. I'm somewhat sure that this dropped in deadmines in the smelting room off one of the normal elites, however i didn't know it was that rare so i just gave it a passing though and that was it. (won it on a greed roll ^_^). But i have searched the AH and have only seen this up for auction once and have never seen the actual product up.<br /><br />BTW those freaking Small Flame Sacs are a pain in the neck to get, way to low drop rates from the whelps in wetlands. Chances are they drop better elsewhere &lt;_&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, I can agree, if this thing does indeed drop from him, it has to be one of the most annoying drops :P As a 60 hunter I can get to him fairly easily but it's still a major pain in the butt especially since I can't reset the instance by myself. Thottbot has it listed as 6 in 1986 kills, so if it is a mistake, 6 people were mistaken, I dunno... seems rather a rare drop for such a relatively useless item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this drop from Thermaplugg as the only engineer. The drop rates on it seem crazy low though so I wonder if there is anyone other way to get it like the Discombulator Ray..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>getting tired also.<br /><br />decided to kill mek dozen times because of all schematics on his loot list, after killed him around 8 or so times, I've seen 0 schematics, nothing but his left arm or some axe or weapon. This needs to drop from something else because I'd like to have it, and im tired of killing mek just to see same things drop. at least the ice deflecter can be vendor bought, so next one wont be as rediclous.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've seen it drop, and as I was the only engineer I got it, and learned the spell :) Happened 23/06 2005 (On Ravencrest, EU), but I didn't take a screenshot of the drop :)<br /><br />it did indeed drop from Thermaplugg, along with the lightning-hat and some green pants.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got it from Mekgineer Thermaplugg. sold it for 80g in the auction house</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SeekerWi</b></h3>0 schematics/deflectors on AH on my server<br /><br />Got this impressive schematic after just 13 boss kills(3rd run of the day!). I'd say that's quite lucky! It takes me roughly 4 minutes from the workshop entrance to reach and kill the Mekgineer(final boss of gnomer). Blink/Stealth is crucial to skipping some annoying packs of mobs, but even with all that, you have to log out for 5 minutes after you kill the boss to get ported to the start, so that's 9 minutes for a 1%(or less?) chance to drop the schematic.<br /><br />It activates straight from your inventory and doesn't share cooldown with anything. And it's 5 charges per deflector, so quite cheap per use.<br /><br />Useful in every single fight against a decent enemy. If you're outnumbered and planning to use Goblin Sapper Charge... Deflector will prevent the drawback. Enemy Shaman, Warlock, Mage? 500 damage prevented. Enemy using grenades/whatever fire damage? Yeah, you guessed it. Doesn't even share the cooldown with Ice Deflector<br /><br />It's great.</div>
