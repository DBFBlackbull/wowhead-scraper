Ore trade in Echo Isles realm has been dealt a heavy blow.\n \"Let 'em charge whatever they want for mithril. I'm sick of trying to keep the ores economy on a constant level. Let 'em learn the hard way of the pitfalls of a volatile market. I've made my fortune.\" said the former ore trading monarch as he rode off, cackling like a loon as he distributed free parrots to random bystanders. At the height of his 'reign' Ecsslo was known to send a free parrot to his biggest clients. \"It's my way of saying thanks\" he was quoted regarding the practice. Many green wing macaws found homes among countless budding blacksmiths. Endless testimonials have begun to pour in, most echoing a common sentiment about how easy Ecsslo made it for many blacksmiths to become Weaponsmiths or Armorsmiths.\n \"He always had the best prices, and we're not likely to see prices that low for such consistant periods again, at least not on this realm. Too many greedheads.\"\n No special commerorative or monument will be struck to mark the end of the era...after all, it's only a video game. \nFlittyElf Publishers offered this excerpt from Ecsslo's forthcoming autobigraphy:\n\nFor the latter half of Nov 06 through Jan 07 I was the 'Mithril King' of Echo Isles realm...I made a ton of gold, and at one point had 1700 mithril bars in the bank.\nhere's how you do it:\n - you need patience.\n - you have to wake up around 4AM (your time zone) and go to the Charred Vale. Continuously run\/ride around the rim of the vale, stopping only to mine. \n - Do not bother fighting, simly run away from those pesky harpies.\n - Each circuit should yield two-three ore nodes. Ignore the copper, but mine the gold and truesilver because these will respawn as mithril.( not that truesilver is so bad, but gold,well...)\n - Being so early in the morning means there are not a lot of other players, so that's the biggest obstacle to finding mithril removed right there. In 2-3 hours I would hearth home to IF with 120-160 ores easily. Once I came back with 220 ores, biggest haul from one trip ever.\n - Sell the bars for 17-18s, be willing to drop to\n16. Always sell in&nbsp; ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes ONLY . \n - Never sell any amount that goes over 1G for that sale, e.g. okay to sell 6 bars for 98s, never sell 7 for 1g14s. Never have gold appear in your prices, always sell for amounts that are always under 1G. This is a psychological advantage. People look for bargains, and many will compulsively click on&nbsp; \"6 for 98s\" price before clicking on a \"15 for 2g40s\" simply because the 6 for 98s looks like a better deal because it&nbsp; has no gold in the price. (it isn't, the 15 for 2g40s is a better price, but many people will not bother to do the math). Also people will appreciate the \"98\" instead of \"99\" because we all know that when salespeople say that the product their selling is \"$19.99\" they are just trying to pretend they are not selling it for $20&nbsp; when they actually are. \n- Also post many many listings. I would always put up at least 30 listings of mithril,&nbsp; in 1's, 2's, 3's and 6's...there are always people who only need 1or 2 bars of mithril, and here they log on and find that you have 15 of them, selling for 17s apiece. It builds confidence if a person goes to buy mithril and always sees that you have lots and lots of it for sale. Every bar that I put up sold within 24 hours..15 1's for 17s each, 10 2's for 33s, 10 3's for 48s, and 10 6's for 98s..that's a total of 125 bars, and they would all sell out everytime..that's overt 20g everyday, sometimes 40 gold in a day because the lot would sell out within 4-8 hours...but I always listed for 24 hours. Make the bid price always just one silver piece below the buy price.\n- always buy out everyone who underbids you, no matter how many bars they list. You won't catch them all, but it does increase your inventory...don't worry that it cuts into your profit, it is more important to create the perception that you are the one selling massive&nbsp; amounts at the best price. Repeat buyers will automatically look for your name and buy up your entire lot without bothering to see that someone else might have stacks for 2g80s ( a better price)..I saw this happen over and over again. Regular buyers would take my whole lot and not even bother to look that another seller had several 20's stacks for a better price...the buyer had been conditioned to impulsively go for my name and to ignore any price that had gold in it...again, this happened over and over again. \n\nSo what do I have to show for it? I'm at level 61 as I write this, and I have nearly complete suits of armor and weapons waiting in the bank for me to level up into...\nI have all 16 slot bags in every bank slot and carrying on my character. When the 20 slot bags get into circulation I will be able to buy them all and replace all the 16 slot bags..\nAnd I have 30,000G in the bank....\n\nheh heh heh...\nbut it does take patience, real patience...and one thing I have noticed is that about 70-80% of video game players are unconsciously impulsive..so most of you will ignore this or maybe try it and then give up after two or three days...you will farm some mithril and start having visions of avarice, so you will list stacks of mithril for 6-7G, only thinking how great it will feel to get that 6 or 7G if that stack sells (most don't). I could never figure out when I would have some 150 bars listed for around 16-18s a piece that some bozo would even bother to list stacks for 3,4, or 5 times what I was selling for..they never sold, how could any seller reasonably expect a buyer to choose a more expensive price?\nWhat manner of self deception must one employ to convince themselves that it could possibly sell? Did they not observe that I never let my merchandise for sale on the AH become depleted? \nIt would often boggle my mind....then this one guy would use the trade channel: \"Mithril bars, 5g a stack, better than AH price\"...didn't this guy realize that regular mithril buyers would know that his statement was false and therefore he would instantly lose credibility? WHY DO THEY DO THIS? WHY? I just don't understand it...(ecsslo, the former Mithril King of Echo Isles begins sobbing)","date":"2007-03-01T19:43:18-06:00","rating":46,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I actually chuckled at this story both because of its humor and validity.\n\nPeople would make 400% more money on the auction house if they learned correct selling techniques as listed above.","creationdate":"2007-03-01T19:43:18-06:00","id":1169066,"rating":-2,"commentid":2692540,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Rzu","importedSubject":"QTF"},{"body":"The King was one of a kind, for sure.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>28465</b></h3>Alchemy at 225 can convert mithrik to truesilver req. transmute skill and item (dont rem what it was called)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I hit Alterac in the mornings on Dalaran, and even then, it's overfarmed.&nbsp; If you're lvl 38+, you can take out the non-elite ogres relatively easily and get to your ore deposits, but odds are you're competing with some other person with the same intentions in mind.&nbsp; Remember to be nice and share, children.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can find nice Mithril spawns in the Charred Vale, Badlands, and Stranglethorn Vale around the Crystal Mines.&nbsp; Just be sure you're fast enough to avoid the Basilisks (lvl 41-44) or strong enough to take them out.&nbsp; They are heavily armored and deal copious damage per hit.<br /><br />From what I've heard, Uldaman is another good resource of Mithril, but as I have yet to venture into that Instance, I cannot substantiate that rumor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>actually they've recently changed the ruins near the Desolace coast. There's less ruins and much less mithril now. Last week I spent maybe 2 hours swimming around because a guildie told me I could get a good supply of mithril there. Later I told him to tell me where exactly, he came and said the whole place had been reworked. So yeah, no longer an option. <br />Overall I think Desolace is one of the best places to farm mithril, there's a good amount of nodes and very few farmers. Alternatively Badlands isn't so bad either, today I farmed for one hour and got 2 1/2 stacks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Best place so far for mithril would be in the cave which is located on Isle of Dread in Feralas (Northern section of island). At least 6 nodes, plus you can grind the mobs for clams (hopefully a golden pearl).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>SKULK ROCK! and all around the southern hills/cliffs of the Hinterlands.<br /><br />It might just be my server, but DAMN!, I found ATLEAST 4 ores on the cliffs &amp; 4 ores in SKULK ROCK CAVE.<br /><br />And I've also found, at times, 1 truesilver or mithril at the begining or end of the cliff trail going to RavenTusk Village.<br /><br />atleast 2 truesilver ores on my run through the southern hills/cliffs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm suprised no one knows about this, but if you run the south border, particularily the south west, of tanaris there is about 6-7 mithril mines rarely farmed.&nbsp; Also while waiting for respawns there are usually 2-3 mithril in the gaping chasm bug caves as well as thorium often in the caves.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Head to Tanaris and run around the bug places.&nbsp; I can usually get about half a stack by running around the perimeters of each one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Hinterlands has an amazing amount of mithril veins. I farmed up 71 ores in no time at all. No real specific place, just stay around moutains, and Skull Rock (which normally has atleast 2-3 veins in it at all times)! -- This is all of course ignoring those blasted level 60 pallys running around farming them.. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Azasharian Diamonds , aquarmine, and mitril dust.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since the release of BC and introduction of Jewelcrafting prices on all ores have skyrocketed.&nbsp; A stack of iron ore on Shadowsong will run you anywhere from 4-6g.&nbsp; Buying bars is usually cheaper but then you miss out on the minerals you can prospect from it.<br /><br />Hopefully thottbot will add a &quot;Prospects into&quot; chart for each ore similar to their &quot;Disenchants Into&quot; for magical items.&nbsp; Most people will figure this out on their own, but it would be nice to have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>One location where I managed to get my mining skill up early on was in that cave in Arathi where you mine the Bloodstone ore, in the north east corner near the horde base.&nbsp; Lots of MIthril and Iron spawns in there as well as bloodstone which can be sold for around 50-70s per stack of 4 in Booty Bay (it's needed for a quest there) easily.<br /><br />Before my mining was high enough for Mithril I mined iron and bloodstone in that cave which brought it up, also iron in the surrounding mountains.&nbsp; I also ran across a trusilver mine in that region.&nbsp; Mobs in that cave are in the mid to high 30s.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>AP newsflash Ironforge, Azeroth....Today, the Mithril King of Azeroth, Ecsslo, gave up his crown. Ore trade in Echo Isles realm has been dealt a heavy blow.<br /> &quot;Let 'em charge whatever they want for mithril. I'm sick of trying to keep the ores economy on a constant level. Let 'em learn the hard way of the pitfalls of a volatile market. I've made my fortune.&quot; said the former ore trading monarch as he rode off, cackling like a loon as he distributed free parrots to random bystanders. At the height of his 'reign' Ecsslo was known to send a free parrot to his biggest clients. &quot;It's my way of saying thanks&quot; he was quoted regarding the practice. Many green wing macaws found homes among countless budding blacksmiths. Endless testimonials have begun to pour in, most echoing a common sentiment about how easy Ecsslo made it for many blacksmiths to become Weaponsmiths or Armorsmiths.<br /> &quot;He always had the best prices, and we're not likely to see prices that low for such consistant periods again, at least not on this realm. Too many greedheads.&quot;<br /> No special commerorative or monument will be struck to mark the end of the era...after all, it's only a video game. <br />FlittyElf Publishers offered this excerpt from Ecsslo's forthcoming autobigraphy:<br /><br />For the latter half of Nov 06 through Jan 07 I was the 'Mithril King' of Echo Isles realm...I made a ton of gold, and at one point had 1700 mithril bars in the bank.<br />here's how you do it:<br /> - you need patience.<br /> - you have to wake up around 4AM (your time zone) and go to the Charred Vale. Continuously run/ride around the rim of the vale, stopping only to mine. <br /> - Do not bother fighting, simly run away from those pesky harpies.<br /> - Each circuit should yield two-three ore nodes. Ignore the copper, but mine the gold and truesilver because these will respawn as mithril.( not that truesilver is so bad, but gold,well...)<br /> - Being so early in the morning means there are not a lot of other players, so that's the biggest obstacle to finding mithril removed right there. In 2-3 hours I would hearth home to IF with 120-160 ores easily. Once I came back with 220 ores, biggest haul from one trip ever.<br /> - Sell the bars for 17-18s, be willing to drop to<br />16. Always sell in&nbsp; ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes ONLY . <br /> - Never sell any amount that goes over 1G for that sale, e.g. okay to sell 6 bars for 98s, never sell 7 for 1g14s. Never have gold appear in your prices, always sell for amounts that are always under 1G. This is a psychological advantage. People look for bargains, and many will compulsively click on&nbsp; &quot;6 for 98s&quot; price before clicking on a &quot;15 for 2g40s&quot; simply because the 6 for 98s looks like a better deal because it&nbsp; has no gold in the price. (it isn't, the 15 for 2g40s is a better price, but many people will not bother to do the math). Also people will appreciate the &quot;98&quot; instead of &quot;99&quot; because we all know that when salespeople say that the product their selling is &quot;$19.99&quot; they are just trying to pretend they are not selling it for $20&nbsp; when they actually are. <br />- Also post many many listings. I would always put up at least 30 listings of mithril,&nbsp; in 1's, 2's, 3's and 6's...there are always people who only need 1or 2 bars of mithril, and here they log on and find that you have 15 of them, selling for 17s apiece. It builds confidence if a person goes to buy mithril and always sees that you have lots and lots of it for sale. Every bar that I put up sold within 24 hours..15 1's for 17s each, 10 2's for 33s, 10 3's for 48s, and 10 6's for 98s..that's a total of 125 bars, and they would all sell out everytime..that's overt 20g everyday, sometimes 40 gold in a day because the lot would sell out within 4-8 hours...but I always listed for 24 hours. Make the bid price always just one silver piece below the buy price.<br />- always buy out everyone who underbids you, no matter how many bars they list. You won't catch them all, but it does increase your inventory...don't worry that it cuts into your profit, it is more important to create the perception that you are the one selling massive&nbsp; amounts at the best price. Repeat buyers will automatically look for your name and buy up your entire lot without bothering to see that someone else might have stacks for 2g80s ( a better price)..I saw this happen over and over again. Regular buyers would take my whole lot and not even bother to look that another seller had several 20's stacks for a better price...the buyer had been conditioned to impulsively go for my name and to ignore any price that had gold in it...again, this happened over and over again. <br /><br />So what do I have to show for it? I'm at level 61 as I write this, and I have nearly complete suits of armor and weapons waiting in the bank for me to level up into...<br />I have all 16 slot bags in every bank slot and carrying on my character. When the 20 slot bags get into circulation I will be able to buy them all and replace all the 16 slot bags..<br />And I have 30,000G in the bank....<br /><br />heh heh heh...<br />but it does take patience, real patience...and one thing I have noticed is that about 70-80% of video game players are unconsciously impulsive..so most of you will ignore this or maybe try it and then give up after two or three days...you will farm some mithril and start having visions of avarice, so you will list stacks of mithril for 6-7G, only thinking how great it will feel to get that 6 or 7G if that stack sells (most don't). I could never figure out when I would have some 150 bars listed for around 16-18s a piece that some bozo would even bother to list stacks for 3,4, or 5 times what I was selling for..they never sold, how could any seller reasonably expect a buyer to choose a more expensive price?<br />What manner of self deception must one employ to convince themselves that it could possibly sell? Did they not observe that I never let my merchandise for sale on the AH become depleted? <br />It would often boggle my mind....then this one guy would use the trade channel: &quot;Mithril bars, 5g a stack, better than AH price&quot;...didn't this guy realize that regular mithril buyers would know that his statement was false and therefore he would instantly lose credibility? WHY DO THEY DO THIS? WHY? I just don't understand it...(ecsslo, the former Mithril King of Echo Isles begins sobbing)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its all about the Badlands. Im 59 now and i left my mining skill far behind to lvl up so for 3 hours i farmed there to go from 163-225 and i got 97 Met ores there, so make sure to check out that area! <br /><br />unless you are on Ysera cause thats mine!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im not sure about other servers etc but i find on a good run for mithril and iron desolace is the best - skirting the edges of the level on mount ignoring the mobs will get you lots of iron (make sure you go as far up the cliffs as you can there are loads of hidden lodes up there) there is also a surprising amount on the random hills and cliffs near the roads<br /><br />for mithril specifically go to mannoroc covern - i almost always find about 3 ~ 4 deposits - another good spot is in the gelkis and magram villages (these are very easy if you dont bother with killing them as you can just walk in)<br /><br />hope that helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where is the best place to mine Mithril Ore?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Also a good place to mine mithril is feralas 26,67 in the cave about 4 veins in average</div>

This stuff is used in such quantities by Engineering and Blacksmithing that you will always sell what you mine for a good profit.<br /><br /># Blasted Lands: just do full circuits, simple.<br /><br /># Searing Gorge: again, just do full circuits. You can do what I do and do a full circuit of the perimeter of Searing Gorge, then drop down into The Cauldron and do a circuit of that (inside and outside). Also remember that at level 230, you can mine Dark Iron, so pick that up too.<br /><br /># Badlands: two good places here. First is Camp Cagg. Just do a circuit round it, taking in the Rock Elementals spawn point as you go. Second place is Lethlor Ravine. If you start by the Master Dragonscale Leatherworker and head into the Ravine and loop round to the north and back out and south past Uldaman back entrance, then you’ll pick up a good amount of Mithril.<br /><br /># The Hinterlands: start at Aerie Peak and follow the cliff face to the south and east. Now just go around the south cliff face until your get past Jintha’Alor, then north up to Seradane and then west back to Aerie Peak.<br /><br /># Western Plaguelands: do circuits of the Ruins of Andorhal.<br /><br /># Azshara: start at the Legash Encampment and head east to the Bitter Reaches. Loop round to the north and back west along the coast past the Jagged Reef and then back down to the Lagash Encampment again.<br /><br /># Winterspring: start at the Timbermaw tunnel entrance and follow the cliffs to the east past the Hot Springs and all the way over to Starfall Village.
