<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Grind it in RFC. Even if you just clear the first section of Troggs + Shamans and the passage to the left you'll get about 50 Linen Cloth. Do the rest of it and it'd be surprising if you didn't exit RFC with about 100 Linen.<br /><br />Pretty soul crushing though.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Apr 14th 2007 8:28pm by DemetriusTGN</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The best place is in my opinion the area around Jangolode mine in Westfall. Those trappers and smugglers drop linen without end.<br /><br /><i>Edited, May 4th 2007 9:19am by BaldJean</i><br /><br /><i>Edited, May 4th 2007 9:20am by BaldJean</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wheres top 3?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WokkaD</b></h3>For Horde:<br />In Durotar (Orc and Troll), try farming the humans at Tiragarde Keep, near Razor Hill, and the Quillboars between Razor Hill and The Barrens.<br />In Mulgore (Taurean), try the Venture Co. , Palemane Knolls and Harpies at various locations around Mulgore.<br />In Tristfal Glades (Undead), there's humans at Silliden Farmstead and the nearby tower to the west near Deathknell (starting area) and the tower near the Sewers exit to Undercity.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Glandrian</b></h3>For those of you who don't fancy grinding dungeons head to Sludge Fen in the north of the Barrens (56,8). I did 3 and a half circuits of this small lake and ended up with 180 linen, a handleful of greens, couple of 8 slot bags, a LW pattern and after selling the vendor trash a couple of gold. Took about 20 mins but be mindful of low levels questing. The mobs were spawning on top of me so your not short of things to hit. Good Luck</div>
