OR you could slap +25 agi on it and go with the original +84 att pwr... but you've got a higher chance to dodge someone elses attacks (thus you won't need the extra stam), AND a higher chance to crit with the agi. In AV, it's swings swings swings and stam really dosen't help if you've got 3 mages blasting you to hell.

Fury is better, yes, but it is worse if you don't have lots of +hit gear, as you need at least 10% +hit to be a decent fury warrior, where you only need +5 as MS. This was just a sidenote, let's continue the analysis.\n\nZin'Rokh has the highest max damage, it has the second highest DPS. It has no +crit. It is good for PvE, but not as good as either of the others. I would say this is number 3 for PvE.\n\nManslayer has +.75% to crit, it has slightly lower DPS and max damage than Zin'Rokh, but it is good, and I would plut it in second place for PvE.\n\nOEB has the highest DPS, it is the fastest, thus has the least max damage, but it is designed for beating up high-level mobs with. The +8 to swords gives you some % chance to not get a glancing strike, and 0.3% or so to hit.

I think all specs have their advantage and disadvantage. Could say right axes 5% to crit so I'll crit more, and yes you'd be right but there's still that x% you're not going to crit. Of course more crit increases the chance and yes you see the difference mostly, at the end of the day you still need to that crit to process. It's exactly the same thing for sword spec, you need that to proc to see the extra damage from a sword, and if it doesn't you'll see nothing special at all. \n\nAs for burst Damage vs DPS on a weapon. The bottom line is \"the max damage of a weapon is going to be what my maximum damage upon the target will be based on\" Sounds like I'm stating the obvious but then again how many people actually  understand that half the time. So how about an example. I hit with my MS the max damage of my weapon is upped with my Attack Power and the MS, also lets say I crit too. What happens? I get a high damage hit that's what. Now lets say I have a lower max damage weapon but higher DPS. I do the same my MS is lower, but I'm getting to swing that weapon faster. Now depending on how much faster is what you need to think about. If it's a hell of a lot faster you WILL see the difference in how quickly you take someone or something down. If it's a small difference you probably if anything see a better result with the higher max damage weapon.\n\nSo to the point and back on topic. If the OEB has an extra chance to hit with sword spec, has a higher speed than an AR (although not much), and has a higher burst damage....\n\n....wouldn't it make sense that the OEB would be putting out more damage overall than an AR?\n\nI guess the only way you'll find out is if you try it yourself. I have yet to myself.

The reason why is that although the proc itself is basically a crit, it isn't a real crit so it doesn't proc any other things that rely on crits. For example, Flurry won't proc from it, nor will Deep Wounds or Impale. In fact when you do MS, the Sword proc will basically add an addition NORMAL attack, not another MS. Due to that, you might do, say, 500 damage with MS, and then the proc will only do 350 damage because it's a regular hit. With a crit of course, it actually doubles the damage of whatever you use so that'll give you an extra 150 damage etc.\n\nYou could argue the extra hit will raise your chance to crit over the same period of time as without it, but the increase is quite small. Where Sword Spec comes up in use is when your crit is already high (say 25%) because that extra hit then becomes quite likely to crit.\n\nPersonally I think Swords are best for Fury specced Warriors and Axes\/Polearms for MS. Though I'm an MS Warrior but I wouldn't sniff at this regardless because I've hit that 30% mark (25% with a sword of course). The dps is insane, the added strength is huge and the increase is sword skill will lower your miss rate, something which is debated about with much annoyance among Warriors. If miraculously Spinal Reaper and this dropped at the same time then I would pass on this, but otherwise I'd try to get it if I could...having said that, it doesn't make you a moron if you pass on it. \n\nThe only time you'd be a moron is if it ended up getting DE'ed or vendored because of your pass xD.","date":"2005-06-26T01:27:21-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Othendras","importedSubject":"Tbh"},{"commentv2":1,"number":80,"id":3070309,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Belive me this one is better then AR i have used them both and with this weapon im always no.1 in MC and i kill AR warriors easy.. no question about it this this one is better.. anyone that says anything else is just talking BS!","date":"2005-07-02T19:56:27-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"nakenn","importedSubject":"Obsidian Edge Blade vs Arcanite Reaper"},{"commentv2":1,"number":81,"id":3070310,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"er.....that pic is wrong :p","date":"2006-05-25T13:17:02-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Zigmaster","importedSubject":"er"},{"commentv2":1,"number":82,"id":3070311,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I want -.-","date":"2006-08-01T19:20:15-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"xanrir","importedSubject":"wtf"},{"commentv2":1,"number":83,"id":3070312,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"on a gnome : http:\/\/upload.kosebamse.net\/wow\/scavenger.jpg\n\nEdited, Tue Nov 29 11:22:21 2005","date":"2005-11-29T17:07:46-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Scavengern","importedSubject":"GNOME!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":84,"id":3070313,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Weapon dmg question....\nUSF is slower and should therefor have more wpn dmg, but there's +42str on OEB, which one has the highest wpn dmg then?

This will not eliminate glancing blows, but it will remove the effect of most glancing blows, due to the +8 Two-Handed Sword.<br /><br />It may not be as good as many other swords in PvP, but it still does a fair amount of damage there as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tsarnkoth</b></h3>It's on the same tier as Zin'Rokh, but whereas Zin will probably do more damage in PvP, this sword drops from more bosses and will be much more effective for raid DPS.<br /><br />As a warrior, I'd be tempted to pass for Paladins first and go for a Rag weapon, but this is very nice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7266</b></h3>I would think the Zin'Rokh is better than this sword. The Zin'Rokh has attack power rather than strength. Strength = Attack power. Just my opinnion, but I rather have a sword with attack power already built onto the blade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7340</b></h3>This would still be the better choice for raid dps with a 2h fury tree. But with the new patch incoming, i think that is a dead way of dpsing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I see so many useless discussions, wich only appear out of greed.<br /><br />A warrior gets the most out of this sword.<br />Shield / one hander? you think they always run around with that? think again.<br /><br />Pala's can use it too, and if seal of command procs with this one, they will get some nasty crits out of it.<br /><br />Hunters... Well, yes, you can use it... For your raptor strike (whoohoo), most of your other moves such as wingclip and mongoose bite don't even do weapon damage... You really gonna use this slow weapon, sacrificing two small fast weapons with HUNTER stats for this one?&nbsp; I bet it's just because it's purple.&nbsp; If it were green no one would even care.&nbsp; Oh yeah, btw, I am a hunter.&nbsp; Most comments on thott are based on greed I've noticed. pretty sad.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Dropped from Geddon for me and I spend 41 dkp's and got it (all I had at that point), an other warrior passed for me. I reskilled 20/31 to fury - and I'm damn happy. This babe makes it possible to make crits of 4550 - my best result yet. Had the reaper before and still use it to compare - the reaper's still a damn good weapon, but such crits I've never had with it (with my gear so far). I've also tried a while the swordspecc in the weaponstree, but it was not as good as the furorskilling I now have. <br /><br />You'll loose some chance to crit if you change from axespecc to swordspecc an to the furortree, but as far as I can tell it's absolutely worth the change in my opinion :)&nbsp;</div>

Crusader of +15 strength?<br />I used TUF before this, and its way better than that.<br /><br />Il respec to sword later today.<br /><br />Btw one more thing.<br />What you on this forum thinks, is this better than ZG Destroyer of the Worlds sword?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My guild got this drop friday off of Garr. MT and OT could bid on it and did not want it. ( MT got binding of the windseeker, part of the legdendary sword, the week before and OT got lots of might gear that run) Guild Leader and the Officers decided to let classes that where plate have it. Only two wanted it. Me ( a 60 critadin/healadin paladin) and a 60 warrior (fury spec'ed). <br />My guild does an interesting way of giving out items. Each item is worth a said amount of DKP and the person with the most DKP(if they are allowed to roll on it) can choose to take it or pass. I was third for paladins and the two above had earthshaker, aurastone, or a nice healadin sheild. No warriors but one wanted it. I figured it would be better for the Warrior so i let him have it. On Saturday he was in top 5 for DPS for MC, even though he had to leave early (he respecced to arms).<br />Point of the story is if you are allowed to roll on it, you can, but think is it better for your guild to have it on a paladin, who will be a cleanse-bot/healadin, a hunter who will only melee on lava annhilators, or a arms spec'ed warrior who can hit over 3K with this. This is all from the PvE aspect from the game.<br />IF you want a PvP weapon you are looking in the wrong place, get to grand marshal/ high warlord and get those weapons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got this from Garr, although the damage is a bit overrated, i wouldve expected to be hitting constant 400's yet i only get 300's. Oh well im pretty happy with it, it owns in BG, i can 2 hit a mage. And i got it for really cheap RP =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>TUF is comparable for PvP, but the +8 2h swords makes it very good for PvP.<br /><br />And no, an arcanite reaper isn't ever as good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Also, the reason why you crit easier on low lvl mobs is that 1 defense skill is also 0.04% lesser crit chance of your opponent (as well as some other things too, more dodge etc).<br /><br />And low lvl mobs have low defense skill. (5 times their lvl)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did anyone know that 42str is 84AP, and 84 AP is 6 (!) dps. Smack a +15 str ench on this weapon and u got 114+ap from this weapon. Thats even 8.14 dps extra, with that sword u will get 73dps.<br /><br />Thats a nice thing;)<br /><br />Plus, lets not forget that its +8 swordskill, that will increase ure chance to hit and give u 0.32% chance to crit=)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Bonereaver's Edge &gt; Spinal Reaper &gt; Zin'rokh, OEB (about the same) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TUF &gt; Earthshaker, etc etc.<br /><br />This is the pre-BWL order of the weps, Bonereaver's being the best. This order is for any warrior build (but if your fury i reccomend dual wielding).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Personally I think OEB seems a lot better in PvE thanks to the skill in swords which should reduce the glancing blows. Sure your Mortal Strikes won't hit as hard, but that's more important in PvE.<br /><br />It depends on how much +hit you have, and if you have other items for sword skill or is human though.<br /><br />The rest I agree with though ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To look at the outstanding characteristics of the three weapons:<br /><br />OEB:<br />Highest dps of the three.<br />Most Attackpower of the three (for warriors).<br />+8 swordskill.<br />Can use with sword spec.<br /><br />TUF:<br />2% chance to crit.<br />1 second stun proc.<br /><br />Zin'Rokh:<br />Highest Max Damage of the three, with significantly higher minimum damage as well.<br />Highest stamina of the three.<br />Can use with sword spec.<br /><br />In my opinion, OEB and Zin'Rokh are pretty damn evenly matched, and TUF is lacking a bit to be called an equal to these weapons.<br /><br />I think a lot of the people who claim that the TUF is better are simply proud of their hard-earned epic, and are sticking up for it.&nbsp; Although, as far as difficulty of aquirement goes, the TUF is arguably the easiest of the three weapons to get, and Zin'Rokh is probably the hardest, dropping at 5% rate from Hakkar.&nbsp; OEB drops from several MC bosses, so it seems it would be slightly easier to acquire than Zin'Rokh.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just incase nobody noticed or nobody plays any of the 3 soul calibur games, the sword actually looks alot like soul edge, a weapon used by a guy in the soul calibur series named Nightmare</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Zin Rohk is the best. If you're a human, OEB is actually better. Oeb is muuuuch better than TuF. If you're not a warrior, it doesn't really matter though. OEB would probably be the best for a paladin. Note, I have zin rohk, used the others.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just think about what this bad-boy could do with a +15 str enchant or +25 agi? You've got 308 sword skill (if you've got your swords that high), which highers your chance to hit a dang rogue with a high dodge rate. Plus with +15 str you've got +57 str which = 114 att pwr. OR you could slap +25 agi on it and go with the original +84 att pwr... but you've got a higher chance to dodge someone elses attacks (thus you won't need the extra stam), AND a higher chance to crit with the agi. In AV, it's swings swings swings and stam really dosen't help if you've got 3 mages blasting you to hell. So you wanna hit fast, do quite a bit of dmg with those hits, and not miss... the speed on this is fast, the str is high, so you will hit harder, and you will miss less with the +swords... the 28 stam on the Zin only ups your HP by 280... so I would say grab the OEB, it looks great, like a huge heavy piece of metal that has been used a lot, and can just rip someone in half (yeah, I'm into the seasoned warrior look) the stats are great for someone who wants to get some good wacks off on a hunter who has their back turned to them, or a rogue who is not having a good time trying to stealth. This sword has a lot of potential for a great DPS-based performance with +15 str and +25 agi on it... sure stam is good... but for me... I would grab the OEB and have fun wacking the hell out of the unfortunate clothies, leather and mail wearers that come in my way while I've got Blessing of might, Battle shout, and all my dps gear on MUAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!<br /><br />Hope this helps in your choice *evil grin*</div>

It has the second highest max damage of these three. It has 20 more stamina than OEB, making it second-best for MS PvP, in my opinion.<br /><br />OEB has no stamina, no +crit, only superior DPS and weapon skill (which doesn't really do much in PvP). It also has the lowest max damage. I would consider this third in the line for PvP.<br /><br />PvE:<br /><br />MS Spec is in no way bad for PvE damage. Fury is better, yes, but it is worse if you don't have lots of +hit gear, as you need at least 10% +hit to be a decent fury warrior, where you only need +5 as MS. This was just a sidenote, let's continue the analysis.<br /><br />Zin'Rokh has the highest max damage, it has the second highest DPS. It has no +crit. It is good for PvE, but not as good as either of the others. I would say this is number 3 for PvE.<br /><br />Manslayer has +.75% to crit, it has slightly lower DPS and max damage than Zin'Rokh, but it is good, and I would plut it in second place for PvE.<br /><br />OEB has the highest DPS, it is the fastest, thus has the least max damage, but it is designed for beating up high-level mobs with. The +8 to swords gives you some % chance to not get a glancing strike, and 0.3% or so to hit. I would say this is number 1 for PvE of these three.<br /><br />This is just my personal opinion, not an international standard.</div>

Critical Strike rate, also factors in Agility.<br />2. Minimum and Maximum damage that can be dealt.<br />3. Chance to land a hit. Only one the game tells you.<br /><br />For a Human Warrior or Paladin, you can get about +20 to Sword Skill by combining racial trait, edgemaster gauntlet, and this Sword; +15 for other races. There could be other equipment as well that increases Sword Skill, but I haven't seen them yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Seems to be a big debate on specs, DPS vs &quot;Burst&quot; Damage. I think all specs have their advantage and disadvantage. Could say right axes 5% to crit so I'll crit more, and yes you'd be right but there's still that x% you're not going to crit. Of course more crit increases the chance and yes you see the difference mostly, at the end of the day you still need to that crit to process. It's exactly the same thing for sword spec, you need that to proc to see the extra damage from a sword, and if it doesn't you'll see nothing special at all. <br /><br />As for burst Damage vs DPS on a weapon. The bottom line is &quot;the max damage of a weapon is going to be what my maximum damage upon the target will be based on&quot; Sounds like I'm stating the obvious but then again how many people actually understand that half the time. So how about an example. I hit with my MS the max damage of my weapon is upped with my Attack Power and the MS, also lets say I crit too. What happens? I get a high damage hit that's what. Now lets say I have a lower max damage weapon but higher DPS. I do the same my MS is lower, but I'm getting to swing that weapon faster. Now depending on how much faster is what you need to think about. If it's a hell of a lot faster you WILL see the difference in how quickly you take someone or something down. If it's a small difference you probably if anything see a better result with the higher max damage weapon.<br /><br />So to the point and back on topic. If the OEB has an extra chance to hit with sword spec, has a higher speed than an AR (although not much), and has a higher burst damage....<br /><br />....wouldn't it make sense that the OEB would be putting out more damage overall than an AR?<br /><br />I guess the only way you'll find out is if you try it yourself. I have yet to myself. But I'm pretty sure my answer will be &quot;yes, it does do more damage and faster, if only by a fair bit&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>To be honest I wouldn't call the Warrior a moron for passing, more a moron if he rolled for it but preferred Axe or Polearm spec because then he's depriving someone else of a weapon.<br /><br />The thing is, Sword Spec is inferior with MS ever so slightly. The reason why is that although the proc itself is basically a crit, it isn't a real crit so it doesn't proc any other things that rely on crits. For example, Flurry won't proc from it, nor will Deep Wounds or Impale. In fact when you do MS, the Sword proc will basically add an addition NORMAL attack, not another MS. Due to that, you might do, say, 500 damage with MS, and then the proc will only do 350 damage because it's a regular hit. With a crit of course, it actually doubles the damage of whatever you use so that'll give you an extra 150 damage etc.<br /><br />You could argue the extra hit will raise your chance to crit over the same period of time as without it, but the increase is quite small. Where Sword Spec comes up in use is when your crit is already high (say 25%) because that extra hit then becomes quite likely to crit.<br /><br />Personally I think Swords are best for Fury specced Warriors and Axes/Polearms for MS. Though I'm an MS Warrior but I wouldn't sniff at this regardless because I've hit that 30% mark (25% with a sword of course). The dps is insane, the added strength is huge and the increase is sword skill will lower your miss rate, something which is debated about with much annoyance among Warriors. If miraculously Spinal Reaper and this dropped at the same time then I would pass on this, but otherwise I'd try to get it if I could...having said that, it doesn't make you a moron if you pass on it. <br /><br />The only time you'd be a moron is if it ended up getting DE'ed or vendored because of your pass xD.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have this sword and i can tell you. Its amazing. With SoC procs i do extreme damage. Kills are rolling in, in pvp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Multiple OEBs can drop in one MC run. I got the 2nd one that dropped. Guess who got the first? That's right, a Pally!<br /><br />This is a great weapon for warriors who want to get a taste of how powerful Sword spec can really be.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dose this thing have any natural glows on it? Because slapping a +25 agi enchant would put a wicked nice green glow on it, and higher your chances to dodge and get a critical strike. +42 str and <br />+25 agi, on top of the +8 to 2h sword gives you a 308 skill with swords, plus a chance to crit, and a nice average hit damage... My Arcanite Reaper hits for 400 on average, and crits for 900-1000 at a minimum. and thats with +15 str enchant.... so would a +25 agi be better than a +15 str, or should I slap +15 str on it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just a quick question.<br />Which is better, this or the Manslyer of the quaraji?<br />I currently have the Manslayer, and now my guild is progressing thru MC, id like to get my hands on one of these, for a start its faster, has more strenth and +8 swords, but the manslayer has slightly higher max damage (Im MS Spec) and a load of other nice stats.<br />A nice reply would be appreciated.<br />Cheers guys.<br /><br />/Nytro</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>effyouzion</b></h3>Obsidian Edged Blade (OEB) is one of the most underrated items in the game. +8 skill to two-handed swords gives the maximum amount of glancing blow reduction possible while also providing 3% chance to hit against a level 63 mob. The weapon skill makes this otherwise unimpressive weapon competitive with some of the best items in the game for raiding.<br /><br />On a neutral race (i.e. not Human or Orc): only two-handed weapons from C'thun and late Naxxramas bosses (<a href="/classic/item=21134/dark-edge-of-insanity">Dark Edge of Insanity</a>, <a href="/classic/item=22691/corrupted-ashbringer">Corrupted Ashbringer</a>, <a href="/classic/item=22798/might-of-menethil">Might of Menethil</a>) are notably better than OEB. All other weapons, including rank 14 weapons, are comparable or worse.<br /><br />Weapon quality looks a bit different for Orc/Human because their +5 weapon skill to certain types of weapons can make those weapons better for them. Because of this, OEB should usually go to non-Human/Orc warriors, while Human/Orc get priority on swords/maces or axes, respectively.<br /><br />OEB is the only way to get two-handed skill on a raid weapon, unless you play Human or Orc. The famous <a href="/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards">Edgemaster's Handguards</a> only provides one-handed weapon skill.</div>
