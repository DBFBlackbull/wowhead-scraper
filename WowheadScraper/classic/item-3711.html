Belamoore's Research Journal drop from Warden Belamoore and is worth nothing and should just be trashed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>11074</b></h3>It's an interesting read, and actually points to a PUQ (Pick Up Quest), I believe.<br /><br />Note page 15: &quot; So I sent the bloodstone pendant with a courier to Dalaran with specific instructions on how to test it, so they may avoid my earlier frustrations.&quot;<br /><br />Also, page 18: &quot;But after weeks of no news my patience faltered, and upon further inquires to Dalaran I learned that the bloodstone never reached my colleagues. My courier was somehow lost on the way, and the bloodstone pendant was lost with him!&quot;<br /><br />Finally, 19: &quot;I have sent another messenger to Dalaran, and hear that even now they are scouring for the pendant, in the ruins outside our protective sphere.<br /><br />I only hope we're not too late.&quot;<br /><br />This may be intended as a lead-in to direct one to a kill or a loot that starts a quest, though I do not yet know of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>..it was an interesting read. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Perhaps it's the &quot;Befouled Bloodstone&quot; thing dropped by Maerz Cowl for the other quest--this book could explain how he got one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the book is taking about the pendant of myzrael<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4056/cortellos-riddle">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4056/cortellos-riddle</a><br /><br />which is dropped by humanoids outside the dalaran circle</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>...that it might be a quest which has not been fixed.<br /><br />Why?<br />Because it sound like it when/if you read the book.<br />as if reading it would start one, or, your suppose to find someone who might take intresset in what the book says.<br />Either way, it doesn't seem to be an existing quest at the moment.<br />Maybe blizzard will fix it at the next update or such. ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>While Hakkar may indeed be &quot;the Blood God&quot;, he's not an Old God.&nbsp; He's a Primal God, which sounds the same, but was actually around after the Titans came, not before like the Old Gods.&nbsp; Ahn'Qiraj seems to be about an Old God, with C'thun likely being the final boss, but I doubt that has to do with the bloodstones either.&nbsp; I'm sure there's at least some clue in the bloodstone quests, but I'm not quite finished with them yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's just adds more behind story, nothing more nothing less. It's same as books on the table around neutral town's inn or something.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>in the story it says that the item was lost in the ruins around the outside of their protective bubble and the closes ruins are the ruins of alterac so maybe someone could go check that place out for the bloodstone thing but i dont think im high enough lvl to check it out. if anyone checks it out and finds something let us all know</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I know it's not the pendant of Myzrael; I got that pendant like five levels before I ever got close to Belamoore's Research Journal, off a Gelkis Clan Centaur literally half the world away (in Desolace, in SW Kalimdor).&nbsp; More likely, it's for a quest that was never implemented, so they left it in for back story.<br /><br />The Myzrael pendant is a random drop that's simply designed as a hook to get you to go to Alterac.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm no expert by any means but could it be in one of those hidden dalaren strongboxes that u need a rune of opening for ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just got the book, ran around Dalanar looking for the courier and didn't find one. Either the book is part of an unfinished quest line (much like The Blackened Shield in Dust Wallow Marsh) or it was just added to spice up the role playing a bit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I took the journal seriously.&nbsp; Read the entire thing, as it was rather interesting.&nbsp; Then I went on the hunt, Snuk through the ruins, killing the mages, taking their runes of opening that I found, then I came to the first Hidden Dalaran lockbox, opened it, and found nothing.&nbsp; There was no pendant in there, and there was no courier either.&nbsp; I spent an entire level there and oppened a lot of chests, and still could not find it.&nbsp; Either the item doesn't exist, or it has an insanely low drop rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found the book and looked it up. any idea when the quest will be finished</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I read through the 19 pages of the book, and I've been searching the ruins around dalaran since. No luck finding it. Anyone?</div>

<script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
new Book({ parent: 'jjghd45bh', pages: ["Kegan Darkmar, leader of the small group of undead who came to us in search of asylum from their \"brethren,\" defies our common attitudes toward his kind. &nbsp;His skin may be rotting and blood may have long stopped flowing through his veins, but he acts very nobly and seems to care more for his compatriots' safety than his own.<br \/><br \/>Indeed, there is a humanity within him that, I confess, I sometimes see lacking in the humans around me.","But why do I mention this? &nbsp;I do so to give credence to what I am about to write, for these words came from Kegan's lips and it is my hope that my colleagues will, upon reading this journal, know why I believe what he said:<br \/><br \/>\"Remnants of the Old Gods still linger in the deep hollows of the world. &nbsp;New forces seek to harness that ancient power, and those who succeed will have a terrible weapon against their enemies.\"","That is what Kegan uttered as he handed his bloodstone pendant to me, and there was fear, and maybe reverence, in his eyes as he did so. &nbsp;And as his hands met with mine they lingered, as if reluctant to give up the pendant. &nbsp;Revulsion swept through me, yet to this day I know not if I reviled against his dead flesh pressed to mine, or if the pendant itself made my skin crawl.<br \/><br \/>For I felt a power within it. &nbsp;A deep, hidden, hungry power. &nbsp;And one yearning for release.","Although my colleagues in Dalaran were cautious to study the bloodstones that Kegan and his followers brought with them, instead quarantining the four refugees and leaving the bloodstones on their persons, the sincerity of Kegan obliged me to study his bloodstone pendant.","My hopes were to verify for my colleagues that this type of stone did possess magical properties, and if we wizards of Dalaran did not wish to exploit the power of bloodstones, we should at the least learn their properties, since our foes may one day use them against us.<br \/><br \/>And so my studies began.","I started my tests with the assumption that bloodstone was a type of rock, like quartz or obsidian. &nbsp;So I began a series of procedures to determine: what minerals were contained within bloodstone, what forces were applied to produce its color and hardness, and other properties common to rocks and ore. &nbsp;But the bloodstone pendant, to my frustration, did not react to my procedures as would normal ore.","In fact, it often acted in precisely the opposite fashion as expected! &nbsp;It was almost as if the pendant was deliberately fouling my experiments.<br \/><br \/>Like it was thinking, and alive.<br \/><br \/>Angered but not discouraged, I switched from assuming the pendant was an inert piece of rock, to assuming it was a living thing. &nbsp;<br \/><br \/>But again, I failed.","None of my new tests brought to light any revelations of the origin of bloodstone. &nbsp;At the time the only riddle I solved was that bloodstone was neither living, nor dead!<br \/><br \/>But it was then, at the brink of failure, that a breakthrough was made. &nbsp;My latest test involved a glass beaker whose brim was chipped, leaving a small, jagged space along its edge. &nbsp;When the test was over, again revealing nothing, I went to clean my worktable and cut myself on the beaker.","The cut was not deep but nevertheless bled fiercely. &nbsp;Before I could wrap my injured finger in a bandage, a good deal of my blood had spilled on my worktable.<br \/><br \/>And as I was cleaning up this new mess, I noticed the strangest thing...","The blood that had spilled near the bloodstone pendant was slowly moving toward the piece of jewelry, as if gravity had somehow bent itself toward the bloodstone. &nbsp;The blood that touched the pendant seemed to disappear, and the red color of the stone deepened as it drank more of my blood.","After seeing this my head grew light, perhaps from my recent injury (though I did not believe I had lost that much blood) or perhaps because I had finally, after so much frustration, uncovered one of the bloodstone's properties. &nbsp;I reached behind me for my work stool and sat down, pondering. &nbsp;Thoughts and questions raced through my head, dizzying and threatening to topple me. &nbsp;<br \/><br \/>Does bloodstone drink blood? &nbsp;Does it crave blood? &nbsp;Does it attract blood?","Or, is bloodstone made of blood? &nbsp;And if so, then whose blood? &nbsp;Mine? &nbsp;The blood of any human? &nbsp;Any animal? &nbsp;<br \/><br \/>Or maybe bloodstone is the blood of some unknown thing, the very thing that Kegan had both feared and revered when he handed me his pendant.<br \/><br \/>That is the question that must be answered. &nbsp;It is the key.","Fire rekindled within me, I then dove back into my experiments. &nbsp;This time I made no assumptions, methodically performing every test at my disposal. &nbsp;This increased my required efforts tremendously, but I would be more likely to make discoveries. &nbsp;<br \/><br \/>And, although my lab here is small and I have no subordinates to spare to aid, I did find one more intriguing quality of bloodstone...","In addition to blood, there are elemental forces fused within the stone. &nbsp;Fire, water, thunder and rock are mixed with the blood (but again, the blood of what?), and although this mixture is outwardly inert, all these forces seem to rage inwardly against each other. &nbsp;So many more questions were then raised about this amazing, and foreboding material.","But to answer those questions, more studies and experiments must be performed on the pendant, and I fear that the Lordamere Interment Camp cannot marshal the manpower nor the equipment for the task. &nbsp;So I sent the bloodstone pendant with a courier to Dalaran with specific instructions on how to test it, so they may avoid my earlier frustrations.","As I waited for the results of these tests, I spent my time speaking to Kegan. &nbsp;Although I constantly pressed him for what he knew about bloodstones, he never told me more than what he said the day he gave me his pendant. &nbsp;And he did not often speak of his time within the fold of what he called \"the Forsaken,\" which is the name he calls his clan of undead.","But Kegan was very eager to speak on other subjects, particularly his time growing up in Lordaeron before its fall. &nbsp;<br \/><br \/>He still holds much love for that lost kingdom, even though it is now ruined, and dead.<br \/><br \/>My growing fondness for Kegan gave me patience as I waited for my test results.","But after weeks of no news my patience faltered, and upon further inquires to Dalaran I learned that the bloodstone never reached my colleagues. &nbsp;My courier was somehow lost on the way, and the bloodstone pendant was lost with him!<br \/><br \/>This is grave news, for although Kegan and his followers still have bloodstone specimens with which we may experiment, I fear the pendant may fall into unsavory hands.","I have sent another messenger to Dalaran, and hear that even now they are scouring for the pendant, in the ruins outside our protective sphere.<br \/><br \/>I only hope we're not too late."]})
