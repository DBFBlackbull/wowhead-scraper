They are the key to kill casters. Save them up for raiding as they are very useful for silencing bosses.<br /><br />-Altimate</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Carighan</b></h3>It is not cheap at all, no. Especially not if you actually want to use them.<br />But, and that is important - they dominate any tight fight. As soon as 3+ (or so) Casters are in one spot, the tactical damage an Arcane Bomb can do is amazing.<br /><br />As I said in the post on the recipe, this has multiple times won the Battleground for me. Bad flag-defend, 2 Mages, 1 Priest and 1 Shammy ganking on me and a Druid. Arcane Bomb, winning is entirely possible.<br /><br />Just pricy to make. I guess if you're a die-hard Engineer you don't need Arcanite for say a Reaper or something, so these are the way to go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rays</b></h3>The reason while this item is hardly used (in general) is because 1) the mats are too expensive and 2) it requires the user to stand still while casting. It's more of a novelty item for the obscenely rich, if anything.<br /><br />I would recommend Ez-Thro Dynamite II as an alternative. It basically does the same thing, and lighter on your wallet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>35664</b></h3>anti caster grenade.very useful in fighting mages,priests and warlocks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>42159</b></h3>So rediculessly expensive it's sad. I'd rather lose 5 HKs or a match or 2 of WSG than use one of those.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Delicate arcanite converter, 3 thorium, runecloth.<br /><br />Looking for a way to burn arcanite?&nbsp; Then you've come to the right place! ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Heh, I wonder if there will ever be a day when we have spare arcanite :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Spent 3 arcane bars on a stack of 9 bombs so far. I just do my best to -not- think about how much money I'm losing. If you can get past that, whoo.. they're fun little toys in a brawl.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Arcanite bars are 30g on Illidan and theyre in short supply. That makes crafting these rather prohibitive at the moment...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Who loses ultimately?<br /><br />The player who dies from magic backlash for NO durability loss which means NO need for repairs.<br /><br />Or the guys who basically threw away from the looks of it... 5 gold at someone's face.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you guys are all talking about what it does and how Xpensive it is to make them but i still havent got an answer ow where it can be found.<br /><br />And please give a good answer not a shortening of where it is found.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yeah cuz most lvl 60s only have 337.5 - 562.5 hp and all 40 people usally stand in one spot...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; Both engineering types can make it, it's a bomb so it doesn't bind or anything at all.<br /><br />&nbsp; Situationally effective, it does cost A LOT to make. I'd imagine most people would waste it, but I can see it being VERY effective in a good five man pvp party, or even a guild WSG team. You would just need to use it at the best time possible to make it worth the cost, and allow people to take advantage of the silence. You could effectively stop magic damage, for example, with 2 of these before a tank charges forward. Though 5 sec isn't long... Either way, I think one of the best advantages is that because it isn't used a lot, it would surprise casters, hopefully shocking them into messing up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>=D blew one of these up in the middle of a guild's caster group when trying to kill kazzak.&nbsp; Well worth 10g to see their entire raid get %^&amp;*ed from no heals for 5 sec, kazzak heal to full.&nbsp; ROFLROFLROFL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Most engineers are miners anyway, so you'd be paying...what?&nbsp; Three, four gold for an arcanite transmute.&nbsp; It's not like you really need the arcanite bars for anything else (except the arc rifle).&nbsp; I suppose you could sell them, but if you're level 60, blowing 8 gold (arcanite bars are ~24 gold on Alleria) on a bomb like this is an economically viable option given: the novelty of the bomb (nobody expects the Spanish In...er...arcane bomb); the effect (draining 1000 mana and damaging for 500 on an AOE item is totally worth it - anyone who says otherwise just doesn't wait for the right opportunity); and the bling factor (nothing screams &quot;I have disposable income&quot; like one of these babies).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I mine my own thorium and arcane crystals, have 2 alchemist friends in my guild who transumte for me every 3 days for free (as long as i don't sell the acranite bars)&nbsp; &nbsp; Ironweb silk is also easily collected and often cheap in the ah on my server.&nbsp; Bottom line is if you have mining and free transmutes this bomb is more or less free.&nbsp; When used at the right moment its effect is priceless on mana dependent pvp players.&nbsp; Usually takes them a few seconds to figure out what happened, and add that slow reaction time to the stun affect, and well...its quite a devistating weapon.&nbsp; I don't use an arcanite rifle so i really have no use for acanite other than these bombs and making money.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is once a joke:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A paladin and a druid is fighting. (We all know how &quot;fast&quot; that will be.) After one hour or so, one of them finally cracked and close to losing, so in a valiant effort to save the fight, he cranks out an arcane bomb. The other immediately kneeled down before him and says &quot;Give me the 10g and you can hit me all you want.&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lol. great joke. fuzzy english though...&nbsp; anyway i think if you somehow manage to mine enough arcanite that you have arcane crystals spewing from your ass, then sure, go ahead and make these. my experience with mining crystals, however, has been horrible. i've probly mined at least 200 rich thorium veins and and found zero crystals. i mean come on blizzard. either make the drop-rate higher, or spawn more rich-thorium (my personal hope) in 55+ zones. but yea, to that guy that %^&amp;*ed over the Kazzak group in blasted lands. that is *!@#ing hilarious, keep up the good work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I STILL say Blizz's idea for Arcanite is not playing out in the current WoW economy.&nbsp; So much stuff we can craft with Arcantie is FAR too expensive.&nbsp; I'm a swordsmith, I know.<br /><br />Arcanite Skeleton key?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>we tried this a few times today and it worked every single time. nice find!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When you plan on raiding your next major city (i.e. Stormwind) then bring these along.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These would be useful (as said) in hotspots like raiding large cities =D, but another thought: a mage a shaman and a priest charge and try to take your node in arathi basin...<br />BOMB FTW! hehe, plus this would be good in videos =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A buddy of mine used this in the BGs once just because the setting was perfect.&nbsp; He was hiding beside a bridge in shadowmeld and a group of clothies we racing across the BG, about to cross the bridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />He decides to try one out so he tosses it, it goes off in the middle of the 4 of them and hits them for nearly 600 dmg.&nbsp; He jumps out, chugs a rage potion, as a warrior, WW's and hits 3, critting and killing 2 of them before their stun even wears off.&nbsp; MS's the one who didn't get critted and kills him and by now the last one is blinking away.&nbsp; Intercepts, and beats down the last one.&nbsp; Theres a vid somewhere that I should post of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Very Sweet item if you can afford it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>5 yard<br />the only time you can use this is when another guild is sitting outside MC/BWL and they're stacked on top of each other<br /><br />or money duels</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This bomb is uber. If it wasnt for the cost this thing would be overpowered. Just drop it in the middle of an enemy caster line in a large scale pvp raid? wow...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1100 mana sounds alot but is it i have a lv33 druid and he has 2000 mana i dont know how much mana a lv60 mage has . is this going to make any difernce apart for the 5 second silence ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Any use of this bomb?.. Do you get 3x from 1 arcanite?.. thats 25g.. Or 2days if you got Alch. Arcane Crystal is for 18g.<br /><br />Waste waste waste</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Im playing lvl 60 hunter(hordeside, Empire) on the Ravencrest server. I just quitted skinnnig and made it to 300 engineering. I would very much like this recipe, i agree that its abit waste just to use it in random pvp etc cause of the costs of it, but i think it would rock pretty much for stopping those alliance from killing Kazzak when they he is up =)<br /><br />ps. if you have this recipe and are hordeside on Ravencrest server i would like to buy it, so feel free to contact me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>1 Arcanite Bar goes for 35G-40G on Ravencrest ... it will give 3 Bombs. Have not tried to throw it, yet.<br /><br />No radius is mentioned, anyone got further Info's ?<br /><br />I think they should change it to 20 bombs and add like 20 thorium bars to MAterials. Then I would actually use it.</div>
