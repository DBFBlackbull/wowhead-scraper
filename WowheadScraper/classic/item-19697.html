<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>22655</b></h3>Nice novelty item for sure. =)<br /><br />There's a uber-upgrade for this item called &quot;Everlasting Underspore Frond&quot; (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=28111">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=28111</a>), a quest reward in Outland.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ironically, it's actually not bad for hunters. The harvest bread can be used as food by any pets that will eat bread.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Wow, this is like the most badass thing on the planet.<br /><br />BTW im a warrior so this thing pwnz.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Stacks with regular food, so when your recently bandaged in MC, vanish, eat food and one of these. They stack and your back in battle that much faster. Some fights you don't always get healing :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Harvest food is good, but not that good. You could carry this around as an emergency food supply, except it takes a bag slot and that slot could be filled with a stack of 20 emergency food instead of what basically amounts to 4. <br /><br />Food is also cheap enough that this is a very expensive use of a bag slot. <br /><br />Nice for novelty factor, but it needs to either make food that doesn't vanish 15 minutes after logout, or have a much shorter cooldown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For horde you get the item by doing that tribute to Hellscream quest outside Orgrimmar. For the Alliance I think it is the tribute to Uther? Anyways, as everyone has&nbsp; already said you get the bounty harvest 2 days after the completion of the quest.<br /><br />The bread, just like the food from the picnic, stacks with regular food. Also, as metioned above this food is great for hunter pets. <br /><br />Matrim<br />Hunter<br />Dethecus</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For the record, on the Alliance side the quest may be obtained outside of Ironforge when in-season.&nbsp; Easy reputation gain for 60's.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item is simply useless for mages, who can summon food which would heal them faster and would take much less inventory space. This item IS good for classes that cannot summon food, and especially for warriors with a lot of health, as it will actually heal them faster than any other food in the game'<br /><br />Note that the fact that you can currently eat harvest food and normal food together for a stacked effect is actually a bug, and will be fixed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>since you can eat this bread and normal food at the same time, and get the regen from both at the same time, this thing is great for MC...<br /><br />grab a couple stacks of conjured sweetrolls from your friendly neighborhood mages, summon up some harvest bread, and yer good for regen in a pinch...<br /><br />I once even had it so that I was Doted during the sulf fight and no dispels were coming, so I just vanished and started easting both, and soon was regenning for far more than the dots were dealing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To the comment that the food stacking is a bug...<br /><br />Don't you think it's amazing that Blizz fixes all the bugs that are actually beneficial right away but those bugs that suck are still around...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Because its free pet food. 2% hp over 25 seconds = 50% hp. It's not good food, but bread-eating pets like it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Waste of room really.&nbsp; If you are so strapped for money that you can't just buy 5 roasted quails, well,&nbsp; sad.&nbsp; Sure the food is free and scales with gear, but it's only 4.&nbsp; Gone in 5 minutes of grinding trash.<br /><br />Best use actually seems is back-up pet food.&nbsp; Waste of space otherwise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This might actually be useful for a priest or shaman or paladin or any healing class, really, if you get one that gives you water.<br /><br />I mean seriously, there are tables outside that give you water and food. So how come you get a horn that only gives food instead of one for classes with mana that gives you water? It should be able to 'read' your class somehow and then give you whichever one accordingly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When I found out about this item, I went straight off and did the quest, I'm actually really really looking foward to this item for my warrior<br /><br />But, My warrior is a raiding warrior, I spend all my time when Not in raids on alts trying to level them up for the time being<br />But for the time being, These are the reasons I don't see the item as being a waste<br /><br />1) I only raid a few hours a night, on the nights I raid, so the cooldown isn't really a problem<br />2) If the raid wipes, That is really the only time I even need to eat food, due to the warrior stature, we get heals<br />3) the +2% boost compaired to the number is actually very very nice for the ammount of HP I have<br /><br />Takeing those reasons into consideration, I don't need much more food then that, I don't need to worry about the cool down, and I don't need to bother the Mages at the start of a raid to get food, which, although it is just a few seconds to make, and then for them to hand me, is still time that could be spent buffing, and my making my own is just easier</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It would have been nicer if you had the option of food or water when you did the quest.<br /><br />Priest always get shafted seems to be the rule</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this yesterday for the first time and when I used it I got bread that restored Mana instead of Health.&nbsp; Perhaps they changed it for caster classes?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is an utmost awesome item. Forget everyone who says this thing is underpowered, just think about how you can brag about having A HORN THAT SUMMONS FOOD!<br />&quot;Hey dude. Guess what I've got?&quot;<br />&quot;I couldn't possibly guess. An awesome item only obtainable once per year?&quot;<br />&quot;Why, that's exactly right! I've got a HORN THAT SUMMONS FOOD!&quot;<br />And then you realize that you've got an erection, entirely due to your bad-assness.<br />Anyway, another thing about this item to be proud about: it's ability to keep track of time. If you use it when you first start playing the character, you can play for twelve hours and know <i>exactly</i> for how long you've been playing, although every twelve hours it does need resetting, so think of it as an old crappy clock that needs winding. (Nevermind that you can do the same thing but better by using the game time function, this is more awesome.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's a nice little trophy, and it is better than the nothing we got for children's week.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>canceled<br /><br />Edited, Mon Feb 6 08:49:41 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>where do you get this item</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I would have preferred if it gave one of the three kinds of food from the harvest table, at least. I originally thought I could hang onto this for emergency pet food, but my cat doesn't like bread.<br /><br />It's.. usable by someone without a healer, but mostly a novelty item. I'll hang onto it anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>look at it this way:<br />not even has mana, but every one has health, don't complain, ITS FREE.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i love dis since i use ALOT of food and i never carry much (most once to west plague was 10) so i really run out fast, plus its just a little prize 4 suicing into demon area ^^ fun, cool, doesn't take much space since i got about 70 slots (everytime i have about 40 slots free) so yeah, cool</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>whats the point of even keeping this? if you log the food is gone and you cant get it back for a half a day - and even then you can only summon 4?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The nice thing about the food is that your health rockets up while you eat it. Yes, the CD is asininely long. Yes, priests don't need food (on a PVE server, at least). But it's still nice to have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>good for hunters but i can't see anyone else really wanting this very baddly, and only hunters with pets that like bread. I have a bear so that is great! Sad it has that awful cooldown... come on, atleast let us use it every 5 hours! The even more sad part is i've used this twice without logging off a couple of times &lt;_&lt;<br /><br />Also i got this at lvl 30 or so, died a bunch finding the place, but was worth the xp and this item ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i se that peeps are putting the book up for auction for up to 20g, i wonder if it is possible to get mutiple's of this item to get around the cooldown...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this earlier and from what I can tell its basically worthless (I'm a mage and can conjure better food than this).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Oh no... a free in-game trinket that we didn't even ask for got nerfed.... wahhhhhh! Sheesh, give people something FREE and they #$%^&amp; about it... figures.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Is there any other items like this? Water for instance?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>You get this in the mail a few days after completing that harvest festival quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>where I get this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>With the 12 hour cool down and the fact that summoned items disapear in 15 minutes of logging this item is just stupid. Yeah I know its free blah blah blah just another worthless item taking up precious slots. The CD just be no more than 60 minutes then this would be worthwhile or atleast make it so the food doesnt poof after you log...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>well my warrior likes it. It saves me 4 bandages a night</div>
