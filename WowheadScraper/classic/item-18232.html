There are two bosses you need to kill if you don't have the key on you. First the arena boss to get through to the top of the arena and then the dwarf standing with some golems for the iron fel(for the quest item). Both can be soloed at 70 without problem. (Hits for about 400-500 on clothies and with about 26-28k health) You'll probably need a health pot if you can't heal. Took me about 2 hours to do the whole thing because I got lost in BRD lol\nSo basicly this is what you need to do:\n1. Jump into the lava and die, then ghost run to the dwarf ghost, get the key quest and rez.\n2. Go into BRD, clear the arena event, run up.\n3. There will be a locked door and a switch that both requires the key, turn right and go to the end of the hallway,there should be a window.\n(and a blocked doorway)\n4. Jump out of the window and head toward, ignore the elementals and the boss, you should see the road going up and the dwarf boss standing there.\n5. Kill the dwarf boss and his fellas(1 elite golem+3 none elite dwarves),\nloot the Iron Fel and head up, go through a few rooms, you'll find a bridge that leads to a long hallway.\n6. across the bridge and go to the end of the hallway, ignore the boss just click on the statue next to him. This is where you get the key.\n7. Head back and turn left at the middle of the hallway, across the top of the arena and you should be standing in the room where the locked door and switch is.\n8. Jump off the stairs and turn on the switch, go back to the window and you should be able to get through the blocked doorway now.\n9. Follow the road, then turn right, the boss is standing next to the recipe at the end of the hallway.\n10. Click on the recipe, congratulations!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4956</b></h3>This makes life a whole lot easier in a raid environment!<br /><br />Also, these little buggers are often summoned by GMs for raid groups that show promise in killing bosses on content push test realms.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kaelwryn</b></h3>The schematic can be found on the floor near Golem Lord Argelmach (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=8983">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=8983</a>) in Blackrock Depths (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=1584">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=1584</a>). Only engineers (gnomish or goblin) with 300 skill may learn the schematic after clicking on it. It helps to clear Argelmach and his golems prior. ;-)<br /><br />The easiest way to obtain the Fused Wiring needed for these is to create and use multiple Target Dummies (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4366">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4366</a>) which drop it as they are expended.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9951</b></h3>The plans to be able to make this item are found in Blackrock Depths (inside the Blackrock Mountain). They are just before the bar in the room before the fire elementals. You will have to kill the boss near them however if you use a target dummy you are able to loot the plans, and then die (or as a rogue vanish).<br /><br />This item is usefull to repair your equipment mid raid, it costs the same as repairs as a neutral NPC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7536</b></h3>Hello,<br /><br />The description:<br />&quot;Field Repair Bot 74A<br />Requires Engineering (300) <br />Use: Unfolds into a Field Repair Bot that can repair damaged items and purchase unwanted goods. After 10 minutes its internal motor fails. &quot;<br /><br />Says it needs Engineering, I am assuming that is to make, or is it to use as well? Can others in the party/raid use it once it is activated?<br /><br />thanks,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>33818</b></h3>In order to pick up the recipe you'll neeed the Shadowforge Key to get to the boss. There are two bosses you need to kill if you don't have the key on you. First the arena boss to get through to the top of the arena and then the dwarf standing with some golems for the iron fel(for the quest item). Both can be soloed at 70 without problem. (Hits for about 400-500 on clothies and with about 26-28k health) You'll probably need a health pot if you can't heal. Took me about 2 hours to do the whole thing because I got lost in BRD lol<br />So basicly this is what you need to do:<br />1. Jump into the lava and die, then ghost run to the dwarf ghost, get the key quest and rez.<br />2. Go into BRD, clear the arena event, run up.<br />3. There will be a locked door and a switch that both requires the key, turn right and go to the end of the hallway,there should be a window.<br />(and a blocked doorway)<br />4. Jump out of the window and head toward, ignore the elementals and the boss, you should see the road going up and the dwarf boss standing there.<br />5. Kill the dwarf boss and his fellas(1 elite golem+3 none elite dwarves),<br />loot the Iron Fel and head up, go through a few rooms, you'll find a bridge that leads to a long hallway.<br />6. across the bridge and go to the end of the hallway, ignore the boss just click on the statue next to him. This is where you get the key.<br />7. Head back and turn left at the middle of the hallway, across the top of the arena and you should be standing in the room where the locked door and switch is.<br />8. Jump off the stairs and turn on the switch, go back to the window and you should be able to get through the blocked doorway now.<br />9. Follow the road, then turn right, the boss is standing next to the recipe at the end of the hallway.<br />10. Click on the recipe, congratulations! You can now make Field Repair Bot 74A</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Don't bother farming BRD for this item unless you have 300 engineering.&nbsp; It won't even let you pick it up unless you have 300.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I found mine laying on the ground in front of the lord golum guy in BRD. It's a scroll you click on it and then click the little bubble and you can make it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The locations on Thott are wrong. You learn the schematics from a scroll on the ground next to Golem Lord Argelmach in BRD.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had wanted this for a while, but couldn't ever get a good group together.&nbsp; I decided to see if I could solo to it.&nbsp; FD + Pet Sacrifice = Repair Bot Schematic In Twenty Minutes.&nbsp; I should have been a rogue.<br /><br />For those who asked:<br /><br />Turn left when you enter the instance.&nbsp; Go through the door, go through the other door to the right.&nbsp; Go through the door to the left.&nbsp; Close the gate, by interacting with the &quot;lever.&quot;&nbsp; Go up the stairs, and stay left until you cross the bridge/gate.&nbsp; Follow the corridor around, until you reach a room with two stairways, one to the left, and one to the right, both going down.&nbsp; Take the one to the right.&nbsp; The schematic is at Golem Lord Argelmach's feet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You need 300 engineering to be able to &quot;pick up&quot; the schematic for this. The bot does NOT give you back materials when it dies because it isnt a pet (and so cannot move either). It does NOT sell a copy of itself. <br /><br />It IS useful for 40 man raids in molten core where porting out to repair the entire raid then killing respawned mobs on the way back in would take some time. If you're in a guild doing MC get this, otherwise don't worry about it too much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It is traditional for the other members of the raid to tip the person who drops the repair bot.&nbsp; If I accepted all the tips people try to give me I would easily come away with 60+gp in MC</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ever heard of a Target Dummy? Easy to make, doesn't last long, Make it! It dies, you get your wiring.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Like every other recipe in the game, you still &quot;know how&quot; after making 1.<br /><br />The repair bot itself is consumed, recipe obviously not.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay this is how you do it solo since no-one bothered to post it before that I could see.<br /><br />Stealth down, I'm a 60 rogue with 5/5 MOD with Nightscape boots for stealth runs, easy as pie, this should be doable for the most part for druids as well, they will need a shadowforge key though.<br /><br />Enter BRD. <br /><br />Take a left, open the door, hang a right (avoid the guard), open that door as well, hang another left, open that door.<br /><br />From there, stealth up to the shadowforge lock, open that.<br /><br />Restealth, head up the stairs, follow the path around until you enter the Manufactory, stealth right up to the plans, get near the barrel of oil, use distract for an extra second if you want it.<br /><br />Right click on the plans, you'll drop right out of stealth and pull agro, don't worry though, you can be in combat and there is no opening delay, click on the copy button and vanish.<br /><br />From there rogues can stealth out. <br /><br />Druids, just die :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>seaforium charges can open almost every door in BRD=D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I hadn't seen the &quot;hello it's me&quot; rogue/druid strategy just posted by Melrin, so I tried a more cautious approach:<br />Just (!) stealth your way to Argelmach.<br />Equip a pet trinket (dragonling, chicken, ... Choose your flavour)<br />Stand in the part of the room adjacent to where Argelmach is, out of aggro range.<br />Make sure your stealth counter is ready, and that you have selected a target close but away from the trio (Argelmach and the 2 golems), summon your pet trinket, immediately stealth and walk towards the target. Your pet will go towards the mob in the big room, aggro and the trio will run after it. The pet will last a little longer than a snowball in hell but that's just about enough time to open the scroll and copy it to your book! Fast clicking required!<br />Voil�!<br />If you're lucky, you can even vanish and not die!<br />My first attempt (chicken) failed but I vanished and succeeded on the next (dragonling) If I'd waited for vanish cooldown, I could even have HS out!<br />You'll be revered later on when everyone can repair after a wipe!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>no you do not, you can make it where the plans specify (most likely with an anvil) but you do not need to make it by the golem</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Once a 300 Engineer deploys the Bot anyone can make use of it to repair their things.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You get the schematic by the lord.<br /><br />You need to be 300 engineering to make and deploy this object.<br /><br />You can sell junk and repair you gear with this bot. <br /><br />No, the engineer does not get anything out of it. It won't even follow you around.<br /><br />Rogues, druids, and hunters can solo this. Or you can have a lvl 60 run ahead of you can pull all the agro...a little risky though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>66 Rogue, soloed it and was able to unstealth + learn it without aggroing bosses no problem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got it the schematic but haven't made it yet. Is this a one-time, consumable item? Or can you keep using the same robot again and again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yep just got mine my group kind of wiped trying to clear room before Golem Lord Argelmach so I just did a suicide mission and sent my pet in luckily the schematic doesnt have any delay after you use it. Just use it and click on text that popups and you will auto learn how to make it. Luckily I didn't die and I Feign Death before my pet died.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i think 300 engineering is required to read the shem</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>59 rogue - I stealthed through BRD to this room, let loose my arcanite dragonling and took the plans. The dragon died instantly from golem lord and his cronies, and I died shortly after. It was worth it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you want to farm fused wiring, then either make a crapload of target dummies to suicide for it, or camp shredders in STV.(Target dummys have insaninly common drop rate on FW, at least for me)<br /><br />Shedders have decent fused wiring drop rate, and are only lvl35 or so, there willonly be 2 of them up at once, but they have decent spawn time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yeah, the fused wiring is a problem, mostly. I'm planning to farm gnomeregan tonight, though, and stock up.<br /><br />I reckon the parts cost somewhere around 3g, then the fused wiring on top. However, I've found that often I'm happy to drop one in an instance, when my bags are full, because if I can sell stuff for 5g, and then have room for another 5g's worth of stuff, that's a profit, instead of having to leave stuff behind all the time. Plus, some evenings, you just find you're being wipetastic, and it's nice to repair on the go.<br /><br />Also, the repair cost -seems- to be about 30% more than a regular repair.<br /><br />And yes, if you have less than 300 engineering, it says that you can't comprehend the schematic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>What mob drops the plans for this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Where is the golem lord room?</div>
