Turning in Bone Fragments will also get you insignias.\r\n\r\nScourge warders in EP have fewer HP than the firegut and often drop more bone fragments than firegut drops dark iron scraps.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6460</b></h3>If you can't get into BRD or don't have the time to make a full run, I would like to second the farming of the Firegut Ogres. They don't drop them in bulk like some of the larger NPCs in BRD but they do drop them very frequently.<br /><br />However, if you are farming these things for the Inisgnia of the Dawn, there are better ways to get insignias. Turning in Bone Fragments will also get you insignias.<br /><br />Scourge warders in EP have fewer HP than the firegut and often drop more bone fragments than firegut drops dark iron scraps. Plus you can also collect scourgestones while you are in EP, thus increasing your rep faster and that means you need fewer insignias to buy your pretty items from AD vendor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tried to farm these in Searing, but found that the best place (except instances, may be) is Burning Steppes, blackrock orcs (may be fire ogres, if orcs are too tough for you).<br /><br />I suppose droprate of any argent trash depends only on mob level, so 56-58lv orcs are the best.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Fire Ogres in Burning Steppes are the best place to farm them (aside from BRD)...I got 9 in 30-45 minutes.&nbsp; They also drop runecloth pretty frequently.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I played LBRS with my friend some days ago and i got around 1-4 from each other mob i could loot. I recommend too try it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well it doesn't show on thott yet, but If you are a rogue, just grab a ton of Dark iron ale , head to the bar in BRD and do some fishing.&nbsp; Full bar clear takes 25 minutes and you should get about 35-50 scraps a run(takes me 15 beers to clear it all, kill plugger and loot the 5 off the table and you won't have to do runs just to stock up)<br /><br />Use stones, and mongoose/giants/firewater to speed things up, and bring a buddy if you want things to go faster.<br /><br />Yes the non elites can drop them in 2-4 stacks, much love in there right now as the scraps AH for 1g on my server, got my epic mount in 2 days.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had a 90% drop rate off Firegut Brutes in Burning Steppes (Dreadmaul Rock).<br /><br />Lots of runecloth as well, got nothing to complain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i got about 90 off the firegut in about 2.5 hrs<br />you also get money, greenies, the chance of a nice drop and runecloth, there is also a few veins and a chest in the mountain.<br /><br />WELL worth a grind now and then.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Been grinding the Firegut ogres in the cave in Burning Steppes.<br /><br />3 hours grinding, 240 ogres (various kinds) 89 drops. Works out as a drop every 2.7 ogres.<br /><br />Drop rate fluctuated over time, sometimes 20 ogres dropped 10, sometimes just 5 scraps. No pattern to it.<br /><br />If someone could log the same kind of stats for solo grinding the orcs I'd be grateful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The little keep just south east of the entrance into the Blackrock mountain, there are bunch of orcs inside and they have a great drop rate.&nbsp; I farmed for about and hour and got abotu 50 less than what I needed for 7 insignias.&nbsp; If you can get someone go to with you, you can farm the orcs right outside the BRS portal, they drop multiples, but they take a bit to down and you'll waste them all and have to wait for repops.<br /><br />The keep is great, clear the guys outside, then inside and the outside guys will be back and after clearing the outside again the ones inside will start popping up one at a time depending on how you killed them. (rogue, I sap, kill one at a time cause there are patrols).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I love people who buy those scraps for 1g a piece. Theyre nuts but i love them and thanks to them, i got lots of gold now !<br /><br />And the best place to get those is definatly BRD. Being 60 and geared out, i can 3-man this place, 2-man if we are just doing trash mobs. <br /><br />So it gets pretty easy to farm BRD. And the drop rate is awesome for DI scraps or core of elements. Just ask a few buddy, farm that place, u will get about 60 DI scraps and 60 cores an hour. And if its not enough, theres always all the other crap, Dark Iron ore, Black diamond, the dark coffer ( always handy to have his libram rdy :P ) <br /><br />Have fun doing BRD, get ur quests done and get loots !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The scraps are easy to farm solo at level 60, as long as you can kill groups of two lev51 elites and three lev49-50 non-elites. <br />After killing the two dwarves guarding the first big room in BRD, you should be able to pull the three-dog patrols wandering the room. Even though the dogs are non-elite, they drop 3-4 scraps a pop (the dwarves do too, but they're more annoying). Once you kill all the pats, leave the instance and reset it, then repeat. <br />I got 30 scraps in 15 minutes this way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>These are easily farmed as a lev60 hunter.<br />First, go to BRD. Freeze trap one of the dwarves in front of you and kill the other, then kill the first. Repeat on the group to the left. (These four alone should net you at least one drop of 3-4 scraps.) The center of the large room should be open to you - use multishot to pull one of the 3-dog pats that wanders around the place, then repeat until all the pats are gone, reset the instance, and start over. <br />I got 30 scraps in less than 15 minutes this way.</div>
