<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I attempt to open the chest in the Gurabashi Arena while the effect was on and it said. &quot;you are immune&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'd reckon that this is one of the most powerful items in the game!<br />It makes you completely invulnerable for 10 sec.<br /><br />Those who vendor it should be banned for lack of intelligence in my opinion.</div>

If she does get killed, I delete the character and start over from scratch. I am on my 14th attempt now and have managed to get her all the way to level 46 without dying.<br /><br />I picked up this potion as soon as I could safely complete the quest and have been holding on to it ever since as my last line of defense. Just today I was in the Swamp of Sorrows doing an easy quest around the Pool of Tears when I got ambushed by Somnus. Within moments I had lost 2/3 of my health and would've definitely been a goner if I did not have this potion on hand. Otherwise, I would've been back to level one once again!
