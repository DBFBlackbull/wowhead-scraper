Thank you so much kind person for selling the plans for a decent price. I wish I remembered who you were so I could make you a squirrel.\n\nI know too many people who make money just by buying things at undermarket prices and re-auctioning them for market prices. I feel really lucky I got the plans for my Engineer before one of them did. (But don't get me started that the new Fireworks and Cluster plans are Bind on Pickup. Grr.)\n\nI'm guessing that's why we'll never see realm-to-realm transfers (except for new realm startups). Someone will find a way to make way too much money by transferring characters loaded with cheap gear from one server to another server where prices are sky high.\n\nUm, anyway, thank you mystery auctioner.","date":"2006-02-19T11:47:41-06:00","rating":11,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"OlEmma","importedSubject":"Insanely Expensive on Scarlet Crusade"},{"commentv2":1,"number":6,"id":2639563,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"If u get the receipe for that squirrel or ANYTHING else that engineers can make, please tell me, user name Mizxu and realm is Sylvanas.

Sometimes as low as 5 gold (but that's rare and they sell out instantly at that price; don't even bother bidding, cause it'll get bought out from under you).<br /><br />Yes, Scarlet Crusade's economy is severely messed up.<br /><br />Today, on a lark, I decided to look and there were three sets of plans: two for 20 gold and one for 6 silver.<br /><br />I bought it so fast, I forgot to see who put it up for auction. Thank you so much kind person for selling the plans for a decent price. I wish I remembered who you were so I could make you a squirrel.<br /><br />I know too many people who make money just by buying things at undermarket prices and re-auctioning them for market prices. I feel really lucky I got the plans for my Engineer before one of them did. (But don't get me started that the new Fireworks and Cluster plans are Bind on Pickup. Grr.)<br /><br />I'm guessing that's why we'll never see realm-to-realm transfers (except for new realm startups). Someone will find a way to make way too much money by transferring characters loaded with cheap gear from one server to another server where prices are sky high.<br /><br />Um, anyway, thank you mystery auctioner.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If u get the receipe for that squirrel or ANYTHING else that engineers can make, please tell me, user name Mizxu and realm is Sylvanas.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i bought plans from a passing by orc for 1 gold :). i will try to put up a pic soon!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just got the plans in AH for 20s buyout!&nbsp; thought it was a bit much but did it anyway just for a laugh, wow im lucky didnt realise how much they really go for!&nbsp; well im makin them now and ill stick em in AH when i do so keep an eye out if your on sunstrider!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had a Hunter as my main and my Rogue engineer was lonely so he made himself a squirrel. He follows me around town but not outside much.<br />I thought having two squirrels might be fun (and needed to boost engineering, really the main point) so made a 2nd box, but you just get two buttons to envoke summon/dismiss the same squirrel.&nbsp; :{<br />When there are lots of hi-levels around I can point to him and say, thats all the mount <i>I</i> can afford!<br />When there's a message saying Joe's CAT eats a haunch of meat (or whatever) I can Say MY squirrel eats a Duracell.<br />Other than that, they are, of course, useless but cute (like several of my&nbsp; GF's)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well when I was playing my alt I found it in VC and mailed it to my main. One of the elites dropped it.&nbsp; <br />I found the recipe in the auction house to go up to 30g. 30g for something so easy to make, your better off looken for the recipe to drop. <br />Don't even think about wasting 30g on it. Its not worth it that much. And to let you ppl know, it dosen't do anything, just follows you around.</div>
