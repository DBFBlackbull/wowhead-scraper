As others have noted, nothing happens. It is possible, however, to sneak back out along the perimeter once you find your corpse, so don't waste your money by rezzing with the Spirit Healer.\n\nDoes anyone know how to kill the Servants of Razelikh?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>homiebrah</b></h3>With the opening of the Dark Portal, this might be a hard one to accomplish, 'specially for Horde. Ally having a whale of a time ganking us coming in from Stonard to the north.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I had to kill about 12 sentries before the Flawless Fel Essence dropped for me. At Level 52 it wasn't hard (banished the pets, sometimes twice, while hitting the sentries), but the low number of sentries around, coupled with the relatively slow spawn rate, made this take a while.<br /><br />Just for fun, I sacrificed VW, mounted up, and ran through the portal. As others have noted, nothing happens. It is possible, however, to sneak back out along the perimeter once you find your corpse, so don't waste your money by rezzing with the Spirit Healer.<br /><br />Does anyone know how to kill the Servants of Razelikh? They became invincible once they were down to 1% health. Is there a trick to this? The fel quest might have gone faster if I didn't have to weave around these guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Took me a few tries to get the plan right, but went for lvl54s only. Used vw with Cosh. shadowbolt sentry to death, at last sec, sac vw. loot and run.<br />Repeated 5 times till drop</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It took me 10 minutes with my 53 warlock: I let the guard and his pet approach, I enslaved the pet and the dotted the guard. <br />One of them died - usually the guard and I killed the other. <br /><br />I got the essence at the 5th guard.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok... for anyone interested in the quest and not interested in bickering about the origin of the dark portal... this is what I experienced:<br /><br />A guildie and I teamed up to do the dark portal portion of the quest, as I was a 50 and was worried about the immortal guards (lvl 57) agroing on me...<br /><br />we must have killed 30 or so of the sentries (lvl 54 and 55) without succcess before we finally decided to disband and see if our luck would change. It did. On the first one I killed on my own, the essence dropped. <br /><br />My advice: if you're low and worried about the immortals (who have a pretty large agro range) take a friend with you... but don't group up.<br /><br />--Depechia<br />Lvl 50 Undead Warlock, Stormscale Server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Maybe it was luck or maybe the quest was toned down difficulty-wise (a lot of quests have been), but I got the essence off the first felguard sentry that I killed. I'm a lv 53 lock and my gear isn't amazing, so the fact that I slipped in and took out the felguard + his felhunter sidekick using the same &quot;hide behind the void&quot; tactic that we've been using since we hit level ten should tell you how difficult this part is.<br /><br />Enslaved a felguard for fun afterwards, but since I was in the middle of nowhere I decided not to drag the thing around all over the place and just hearthed. OMW to turning quest in as we speak.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Drop rate still ridiculous.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just did this quest and now riding to felwood to hand in<br />i am demon spec and had felguard so i found it quite easy<br />just avoid the 57's and everything is all good<br />52 lock</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sooled as level 50 lock. Demon specked. Waited till felgaurd was nearly dead, banished enemy, health funnel, repeat. Very easy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I currently have both the other Fel Essence's the Jaedenar one took me about 5 kills, the Azshara one took me about 40 kills on each type of Satyr, but I cannot get this essence I am 58 and kill the Felhound and Gaurd with no problems but I can't get the item, I have killed it many times and asked a GM about it, his reply was that the area wasn't always 100% working and that I should keep trying. Anyone else having this issue?<br />Edit: I have killed 46 of these and have yet to have looted it I'm still going though<br />Second edit: 67 killed and i've given up</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>since the burning crusade is now released we all know the beyond the dark portal is dreanor ruins also known as the outlands.sadly you must have the burning crusade pack to get in.and you must be lvl 58+.that is all my info.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I agree with Mekky, im lvl 55 and this just wont drop and yes the others dropped within 2 kills for me......blizzard gayness strikes again!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok that is all good but where are the sentries at?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>4% my ass. Been here for 2 hours trying to get this stupid essence. I give up... Infernals aren't worth it anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I paired this at lvl 50 with another lock of the same level. It was really quite simple with all essence drops involved.<br /><br />In Jaedenar people had already cleared the surrounding area, it was a case of the two of us DOTing the Legionaires. It took about 4 - 8 kills, not too bad.<br /><br />Same goes for Azshara, although with the given space it makes it far easier to kill, without drawing surrounding aggro's.<br /><br />Finally for Dark Portal, it took about 7 - 10 kills, not including the felhounds. It was a simple case of banishing one, then kill the other. With 2 x all DOT's, 1 voidwalker and 1 felhunter, this was reasonably smooth.<br /><br />Im suprised you all had such a hard time. This took me approx 2 hours total with 2 lvl 50's. Perhaps a recent patch made it easier?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I agree with Mekky, im lvl 55 and yes the other 2 essences dropped within 2 kills.....blizzard gayness strikes again!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Same thing as all others... banish felhounds DOT the sentries then major damage to him.... got it on the 5th guy! soloed at 54</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got first two essence off first legionaire and second satyr i killed.must have killed 2 doz or more sentries last nite,nothing.heading back to try again :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got it on my 2nd Felguard Sentry kill. Banished the pet each time and used fear + dots to win.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me a total of 9 hours to get the Flawless Fel Essence here. The Felguard Sentries are lvl 55, and they travel with lvl 55 Felhounds. There are also lvl 57 mobs in the area as well, but they are easy to dodge. Tough to solo for lvl 50 'locks. I suggest you bring some friends.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got it after about 10 kills.<br /><br />Soloed it at lvl 53. Banished the felhound, killed the Felguard Sentry, looted and ran away.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Would be so much easier if there weren't so many bloody ganking alliance farmers here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got it on my 2nd kill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got the essence on first kill, couldnt even kill the felhunter looted and escaped <br /><br />50lvl lock lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I read the posts for this quest here and most folks said this was the hardest of the three essences to get. I'd solo'd the other two with no problem (lvl 54), but after reading the posts, I decided to bring a friend for this one.<br /><br />On the first sentry we came upon (he was lvl 55), I Enslaved his felhound and sicced it on him. I looted the essence off that first kill. Since we didn't need him anymore, I dismissed the felhound and we killed him. I then had to apologize to my friend for bringing him *all* the way over from Kalimdor to help me when all he did was get in 5 or 6 hits total. Go figure. When it's a drop, you never know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok that is all good but where are the sentries at?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>it aint important to get Infernal this early, so i dont see why u are trying t do it before 55-60</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ive killed like 10 and nothin yet not including the hounds startin to get annoyed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Soloed it as a 51 Aff/dest. Banished the felhounds DOTed the sentries and fear/shadow bolt. Fear may end up aggoring more but as long as u kill the sentry and get the loot its ok.<br /><br />Got it on the second one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just did this with my 50 lock.<br /><br />Enslaved a Felboar lvl 53, sent it in after the Sentry and banished the Felhunter. DoT's on the Sentry while they duke it out, rebanish pet as necessary. Got the essence on the second try.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kalimad</b></h3>Soloed as level 50 drain tanking spec with full suppression talented along with Succubus. The pair are 54-55 in any combination, which means some Felhunters can be 55 with a 54 Felguard. I pulled with an amplified curse of agony, corruption, siphon life on sentry and set demon to attack it, following that i curse of weakness the Felhunter and banished it. I switched back to the sentry and maintained dots and drained life, only switching back to the Felhunter to rebanish. I had an escape route planned if i couldn't finish off both, and if the Felhunter is 55 i recommend always choosing to run from it because it burns mana. The 2 mobs that pat on the eastern-most side are easiest because there is a clear escape route heading west from there along the terrain's cliff-like edge where you wont pull adds. Don't want to share how long it took, but I used a whole bag of shards, and died about 4 times, the death walk is not terrible. Doable for those who seek a challenge. Be careful.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
