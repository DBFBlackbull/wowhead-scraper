\n(possible this has been fixed...but I doubt it)\n\nThis prolly doesn't have much factor on the tiger drop rates for this particular item since it is already skewed from the fact that most people killing them prolly don't have this quest.\n\nFor the nice person who calculated how much money you would earn from the other drops you can cut that in half as about half of the tigers have nothing on them at all.&nbsp; So unless you are a skinner (like me) you really might not earn that much killing these for hours....although yes you might level a couple times.&nbsp; Once I level (very close now gained over half a level so far on these) I am going to quit if I haven't hit it by then as there are better mobs I can kill to complete quests that actually work.&nbsp; \n\nAs for skinning....well I am already up to 270 off of these things...so I am not too worried, being only level 36 on this character although the 10 gold or so on skins will be nice I guess (being a skinner alchemist I never have to worry about cash)\n\nEdit:&nbsp;

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The numbers given here for quest drops are a little inaccurate.&nbsp; They include all kills, regardless of whether or not someone can get the quest item.&nbsp; And it's fair to assume that not everybody in Stranglethorn is doing the quest.<br />That said, you could get really unlucky and be doing the quest til your eyes bleed.&nbsp; That's life</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Something that most people don't realize with the drop rates shown here is Thottbot is only able to calculate if there is something <b> actually dropped</b> <br /><br />That means drop rates will actually look much higher for mobs that drop <b>NOTHING</b> most of the time.&nbsp; <br />(possible this has been fixed...but I doubt it)<br /><br />This prolly doesn't have much factor on the tiger drop rates for this particular item since it is already skewed from the fact that most people killing them prolly don't have this quest.<br /><br />For the nice person who calculated how much money you would earn from the other drops you can cut that in half as about half of the tigers have nothing on them at all.&nbsp; So unless you are a skinner (like me) you really might not earn that much killing these for hours....although yes you might level a couple times.&nbsp; Once I level (very close now gained over half a level so far on these) I am going to quit if I haven't hit it by then as there are better mobs I can kill to complete quests that actually work.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for skinning....well I am already up to 270 off of these things...so I am not too worried, being only level 36 on this character although the 10 gold or so on skins will be nice I guess (being a skinner alchemist I never have to worry about cash)<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; I did have to add that I finally got this right before I levelled....wahoo.&nbsp; I hate abandoning quests...but at the same time I am not going to farm for 2 levels to get something to drop</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>give me the fang pleaze. i've gotten ganked 10 times dropping these $*#&amp;@#&amp;#$&amp; tigresses.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This thread is so lucky and all that $%^&amp; that I had to kill another 20 after reading it all in order to get the ^&amp;*!ing fang. GG Blizz on making quest items take so many kills to get you get more XP and loot from trying to get the item than you do from turning in the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>killed maybe 30 before coming to allakhazam, then after i read this page, the next one i killed dropped it (wtg allakhazam)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So, Ive been grinding off the Jungle Thunder's and saw this quest in my quest log. Came here to see where the item dropped and learned it was off the Tigers who were very close to my grind spot. I see one and figure I should grind these considering the low drop rare. I attack, and as I am fighting I think...I'll probably get my drop...and I did. Only needed to kill one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow, killed dozens, read the posts then very next one dropped</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>after reading this thread, dropped on the first kill. Before reading this thread, was grinding for OVER an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>First kill landed me a tooth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, reading this, I thought hey great, I'll try this magic thread out, why not. Well...after reading this...I got a lot of nothing, some tiger meat, a lot of leather, frustration, another level, and about an hour later...a fang.<br />Checked here to make sure I was killing the right thing...turns out the drop rate is just...hideous.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok I never post but had to on this. I figured everyone was just making a joke when they said it happened to them too, and that may be still be true. However, it really did just happen to me. I killed maybe 15 tigresses in the north part of STV, then wasn't sure if I had the right ones. I checked this site, saw these posts and chuckled at them, then went to work on a different quest just south of Grom'gol. While killing jungle stalkers I saw a tigress, killed it, and there was my pristine tigress fang. So, it was the first one I killed after checking out this site. I did change locations so maybe it doesn't count :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>wow guys i really though it was all just posts of peole playing along with what everyone else was saying but i seriously did that. was killing for an hour then read the thread and first kill was the fang i was so shocked</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>HAHAHHA<br />after killed like 40 tigress and came back here to check if that mob really drops it... read the other comments and thought &quot;naah, that won't happen to me&quot; but at the second mob while i was alt-tabbing here it finally dropped <br /><br />LE: and i have inv full =))<br /><br />Edited, Tue May 23 09:01:21 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow! Killed dozens and dozens, then I read this post! Then I killed dozens and dozens more and then I ran out of arrows!<br /><br />Worst quest ever &gt;&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>killed 15, read this forum, killed 2, got it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i was reading this post and getting kind of depressed, and then it dropped, 38 lvl tigress near Bangalash, prob just random luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got it at 41, 39 after a way too long grind.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well, I just killed the tigress next to him, maybe it was his mate, lol. And that wasn't anything lucky cuz she just happened to be the last Stranglethorn Tigress left after I cleared the rest out. It could just be odds or coincidence, who knows.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Also my first post, in fact just joined to show that this does work for some odd reason. Probably killed about 50 of the tigers in the past 3 days. While in game, clicked to this page, maximized the game again, and the <i>very next tiger</i> dropped the fang. Weird but wow just glad it worked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>dropped first kill</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've killed 136 of them, and no drops... been at it for almost 2 weeks (off and on). And I don't know where these level 32 tigress are, as I've only seen levels 36-38 (hunting near Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound around the Bhag'Thera spawn near the road)<br /><br />although I did get 33 shadowcat hides so far...<br /><br />Aiellen 38 Orc Hunter - Thunderhorn<br /><br />Edited, Thu Mar 9 08:02:05 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Talk about lucky, got it on my first tiger :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Same thing, looked up the quest on Allak., the very next one i killed it dropped....spooky</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ciraq is right. I came here for help, alt-tabbed back...and the next one I killed dropped it.<br /><br />If you have that quest, quit reading and kill another. It just might drop!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Holy @%#*...I questing up around 49,22 kill about 15 tigress' and no drop...was curious on the drop rate of the fang and the general area in which to find one at. Hopped back on WoW to finish another quest, on my way out of the area first tigress i kill it drops. THIS AINT NO HOAX ALLA SAVE THE DAY AGAIN :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was wondering what the drop chance on this was, since I've been killing Tigeresses by the bucket load looking for one of these.<br /><br />Seems that most of the quests in Stranglethorn rely on collecting items with depressingly low drop rates. I suppose it's good for xp, anyway :-/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Trying the lucky thread thing..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>That is the second time this has happened to me. I have been killing these things for awhile now and checked out this page for drop rates, saw that people go thiers after being here and went back and killed another one, Boom! There it is. This also happened killing kobolds in 1KN for that ore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just happened to me, checked this thread here, went back, killed one more panther, then killed a tigress and, voila! got the fang! Wow, I just can't believe this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow.. been semi-grining these tigresses for a while now.. a day or two atleast.. may have killed 50..60 of them? I alt tab to this forum to check and make sure im killing the right creeps.. BAM.. I attack one.. alt tab to read this, go back.. its dead and had loaded the fang.. Woot for coincidences :-0<br />Terrardar - Bloodscalp</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i'd say...after 75 or so AND reading this thread (a couple of times)...FINALLY..it dropped!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got it on a level 31 tiger at 31,39</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>there is no real trick to finding the pristine fang i just tried the little &quot;miracle&quot; this guys talked about when visiting this site and then instantly on the next tigress found one. i tried it every way they described and 15tigress's later i found a fang so it was pure luck for them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got her tooth before I even got all the claws. Must just be luck of the draw I guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It worked again for me as well, killed about 30, read here, first kill after reading here, got it...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was expecting a real grind-fest given the drop rate for the Pristine Tigress Fang, but...<br /><br />I lucked out for a change. Picked a mob at (39,35)- first kill and it dropped! <br /><br />Must be that scary voodoo everyone appears to have experienced - worked for me too ;-)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Apr 21st 2007 6:26pm by OtisAardvark</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I did this quest last night and while I had to kill 25 of these things someone in STV general chat got his after only 6!<br /><br />Shadowmazd</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well that was odd.<br /><br />I saw the posts, tried it out, got nada from the next four Tigresses. I went to post, only to be directed to a login screen. Irritated, I did so and began fighting another as I navigated my way back here. When I switch back, the Tigress is dead, and what do you know, the Fang dropped.<br /><br />I still call BS. But it's interesting, in any case.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I didn't believe that this many people had gotten this annoying quest item right after reading this page. So I left the page on overnight, just logged in to my character, and the next tigress I killed, a 37 at coordinates (35,34) dropped it.<br />I can't believe it, I killed about 60 before this and got nothing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well... I can't say if was just luck, or if this post has some really odd trick... but after reading this post, 2 kills and fang dropped x_x</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>it may seems by your posts that alt+tab to allakhazam and back to WoW may work :) LOL<br /><br />i was killing tigresses near master leatherworker post and where king bangalash is placed... for about 60min ... read this post and no coordinates helped or .... so i changed location, moved across road where bag'thera spawns and drop from second</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>swdan</b></h3>after 75ish of kills i removed the quest. won*t waste my time anymore</div>
