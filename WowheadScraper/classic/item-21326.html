I thought I would share a little concept here for anybody whom whishes to botain this trinket. \n\nI got form hated - revered in one week or actually a little less. How I did I do it you ask? wel if you didn't im going to tell you anyways.\n\nBasically In order to get hated - revered reputation all you have to do is throw a raid. During a raid group you still obtain the normal 5 rep per kill. You just gain the reputation alot faster then normal. This has been tested and is true. Once I threw the first raid it became a major hit on ther server or at least the alliance side. Once I threw teh first one each time i messaged people tehy joined asap. If you can get a raid going youll be able to gain rep faster then ever before! i got form hated to revered in 10 hours! then in took me a week to get form revered - exalted. \n\nOh and let me clear up a few things for everybody :)\n\n- You stop getting reputation points once you hit revered. The only way to gian reputation at this point is through collecting Feathers\/Beads. You can also complete a few quest but tehy only give you 100-150 reputation so if your in a raid save these quest for when the raid dies since you don't get and points for your kills to complete the quest in a raid group. REP DOES NOT STOP \/1 THROUGH HONORED AS SOME BELEIVE.\n\n- Named mobs will give you 15 reputation points no matter waht your faction is currently at. if you are revered you still get 15rep per kill of a named mob\n\n- The ancestor in fact does only stick around for an everage of 20 seconds. heals for normally 400 damage and does magic damage or anywhere from 230-330 that i have seen so far. The timbermaw is very weak as it dies fast but it is extremly cool to have! furries!\n\nOne other cool thing that i really wish i realised prior to handing in the final quest and I'll let you all know. Once you are given the quest for teh trinket and you complete and get your trinket. The Timbermaw leader tells you that if you are form the Allaince then peace is brough. The quest ask you to go speak with King Bronzebeard.\n\nOnce you go speak to king bronzebeard he makes a speech to all of Ironfroge literally stating that you are a hero of ironforge and the allaince! that you have gone past teh call of duty in diplomacy and have earned an alliance with the Timbermaw on behalf of us all! It's actually a really good speech ad he says your name out loud and ask people to cheer you you and etc. That was very very cool and i wish i would have known prior to or i would have waited until later tonight! If you want fame on your server wait for a friday night and complete the quest lol! It was tons of fun and alot of omg! whispered to me lol.\n\nOh and teh quest also gives you 9999xp 400rep with bboth ironforge\/stormwind and something else i beleive but i cant remember.\n\nWell thats all the info I have and should be good enough to get you on your way! jsut keep in mind if you are trying for teh trinket you arent ttrying to get it because its Elite! your trying to get it because youll be one of teh fewq on your server with it! there are currently 2 ppl on my server with it and im one of them lol. \n\nOh and i have one question lol.. I got exaulted and then it sets rep to.. well waht mine was cause i had a little extra feathers was to 35\/1000? Id this strange i thought so? ><\n\nHope this helps a little and by the way! this is my first post on thottbot! woot woot!\n\nElura~~\nServer: Greymane","date":"2006-01-15T16:48:11-06:00","rating":101,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"To get reputation for killing this guys you have to actually hit them at least once.&nbsp; I guess parties will still ok, but Bliz notice this and change it in one of the patches.","creationdate":"2007-03-29T16:48:11-05:00","id":1173619,"rating":5,"commentid":2711836,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"kankuamo","importedSubject":"No raids any more"},{"body":"This hasn't been the case for me.

Just remember one thing: keep the feathers from Felwood or the beads from Winterspring (both soulbound) in the bank and use them when you no longer get rep from killing mobs - it will shave a big chunk of the 21000 points needed to go from revered to exalted. \n\nThe Quest \n\nWhen you do get exalted with the Timbermaw Hold - One Eye Gorn in the timbermaw tunnel will give you The Root of All Evil (elite) quest and a torch. Gather some friends and go to Timbermaw Village just east of Everlook. Use the torch in the cave to summon the demon that has been corrupting the timbermaws and kill it. Get the Essence of Xandivious quest item from the basket and return to One Eye Gorn to recive your Defender of the Timbermaw epic trinket. Now go to Orgrimmar and speak with Thrall. Your name will be announced all over Orgrimmar and you will get extra reputation. \n\nThe Trinket \n\nThe Timbermaw Defender is the cutest trinket ever and it rocks! Here are the facts. The trinket acts like a pet. When you put it on there is a 30 sec activation before you can use it so you have to plan ahead a little when using this. It has a 10 mins cooldown and will cool down no matter if you have it on you or keep it in your bags. When you do activate it it lasts for 20 sec and that may not sound of much but let me tell you it is! It will fire SEVERAL lighting bolts at your enemies AND heal you SEVERAL times if you are injured. \n\nThe Healing \n\nIt will cast several healing waves on you in battle if you are injured. Testing shows about two healing waves pr battle and anything from 900 - 1300 health on average. The healing is instantaneous. \n\nThe Damage \n\nIt will fire several lightning bolts (nature damage) at your enemy. Between three and six lightning bolts pr battle which is about 800 - 1800 damage on average. The bolts will sometimes crit for about double damage. Also the timbermaw defender will sometimes hit the enemy with its staff for a small amount of damage ;o)","date":"2006-01-15T16:48:11-06:00","rating":28,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"FjalarTH","importedSubject":"Defender of the Timbermaw - The Facts (Horde)"},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"id":2711913,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"This item rox ur sox! \ncoolest trinket in game, enough said.\n\n[url=http:\/\/img238.imageshack.us\/img238\/8195\/timbermawtrinket8ag.gif]http:\/\/img238.imageshack.us\/img238\/8195\/timbermawtrinket8ag.gif[\/url]","date":"2006-03-29T16:48:11-06:00","rating":23,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Salchant","importedSubject":"<3 Timbermaw"},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":2711927,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Just to let everybody know even though the post doesnt ask for it. If you are good at organizing events and such you can get fromHated - Revered very fast. So fast it should honestly take you about 10-12 hours only. \n\nSimply contruct a raid and head to north felwood. Try to keep the raid 20+ people and have a warlock in your party incase people wanan join form IF and etc. \n\nIf you are good at keeping riads alive and good at ggetting peoples interest you can get revered easily. Or semi easily I suppose lol. \n\nI ran&nbsp; raid and it lasted 53 1\/2 hours and had a total of 2,500+ people join ti during its lifespan. It was a great achievment and im currently known all over my server for it and other raids. Anyhow that was besides the point get a good raid started and rep wont be a problem for you. \n\nAs well if there are others around teh area for example I am alliance and a 5 man group of horde came to farm vs our 20 man raid... if you are on pve then simply tag kils and tehy will get annoyed and ehad to south base.. if you are on pvp then just kill them :P \n\nThe hardest parts with reputation is getting Exalted. In order to get exalted you need to collect a total amount of 2100 feathers. The feathers drop much more frequently in north base then the south and you can gain them alot fast being solo or having a guild group of 5 people on ffa. \n\nI was howevor very lucky.. because i hleped hundreds on my server achieve revered and probally around 1500 achieve honored. I was easily able to make a raid group of 20+ people that allowed me to loot all the feathers. Even with 20 people working for me it still took around 40 hours to collect all the feathers... So dont think its any easy task cause it does take forevor to get form revered-exalted. \n\nlet me clear some facts for incase anybody ask. \n\n1) the Timbermaw summons only for 30 seconds and fights\/heals \n\n2) timbermaw heals for around 700-800 normally. Also hits for about 300-400 magic damage. \n\n3) the cooldown is 10 minutes long \n\nyes the trinket does lack a few thingss for teh work but keep in mind.. If you are going after a epic super elite trinket this isnt the one for you. If you after a trinket that nobody else will have then this is the thing for you. Plus its purple. Only 2 people on my server have it to date and im one of them.

So many beads and feathers you could go blind. \n\nThat being said, there are some resources to be had along the way. Both camps drop a lot of runecloth, potions, scrolls, and of course the occasional blue or purple. Heck, a Destiny dropped for us on the last week of grinding.\n\nAs posted above, when you hit exalted, you get one quest, to plant the torch in the mouth of the chiefs cave and summon the demon. What you don't know is that the demon spawns down the hill behind you! Xanivicious is a 62 Elite demon identical in look to the demons that drop Felcloth in Felwood. When the quest says \"bring a few friends\", bring 5-10, just to be sure. I went in with 2 others, with a 3rd joining, and he tore us apart.\n\nHe has three different attacks:\n\n1. Hits for 200-300 on swing.\n2. Dots you with poison.\n3. Hits you with an armor acid.\n\nWithin 4 times of dying (60 Paladin) against this guy, I had lost total durability on Chest, weapon, and shoulders. He also heals very fast, so hit him hard with one group.\n\nAnd for those mischevious types out there, something to note: The demon timeout resets every time he engages a target. If you don't kill him, he just walks around the camp taking a swing at every horde and alliance member that comes by. While we were waiting to assemble our group, Xan killed three horde and a couple farmers who were just star struck at seeing an elite demon in the middle of their area! \n\nAlso note that if you are in a mini-raid, you have to leave the raid to pick up the basket that the demon drops.\n\nSo if you don't want to get your trinket right away, keep planting the torch and count how many people get eaten, because you have to turn the torch back in to get the trinket.\n\nTHE TRINKET:\n\nTough call on this one. All posts above are correct. He lasts for 20 seconds, does decent damage with spell casts, heals you when you drop below 50%, which can be cool. He can also be summoned without a target which can be helpful before a fight or just running around town. He can also accept buffs if you want to keep him around longer. \n\nHis weakness is just that, he is soft and vulnerable. He is a teddy bear that should not be hit! This is a good trinket when you are fighting a single tough target or PVP. If you are fighting multiple targets, his spells do enough damage to take aggro, and he will go down. My Paladin had to heal him once to keep it in a fight.\n\nWith a 10 minute cooldown, this can be used a lot, but do not take it into the higher level instances, too much damage being thrown around there, and your teddy bear will take the big dirt nap.\n\nI don't regret getting this thing though. People ask about it all the time. Recommended, but just don't expect the end all of trinkets.\n\nMark","date":"2006-06-10T16:48:11-05:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"MarkSargent","importedSubject":"Other odds and ends about this quest\/trinket"},{"commentv2":1,"number":16,"id":2711966,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"[b]Patch 1.10[\/b]\nLv60 Mage\n\nThe Trinket is only attainable once you become Exalted with the Timbermaw and have slain thier greatest enemy - Xandivious\n([url=http:\/\/70.85.133.74\/?n=992074]http:\/\/70.85.133.74\/?n=992074[\/url]).\n\n[u]The Grind of your life[\/u]\nI went from Hostile to Exalted in 3 weeks of very hard (mostly solo) grinding in the northern village of Felwood (south has low drop rate and furbolgs that fear which is annoying). \n\nBeing a mage, aoe spells helped a lot.

This is no longer the case, One Eye now takes it back in order to complete the quest.[\/i]\n\n[u]Encouragement[\/u]\nI always came to this page when I needed a morale boost during Revered to Exalted and it helped a lot. I don't know how easy it was before 1.10 but this was incredibly hard, you need a lot of patience and resolve! Keep at it, it is worth it in the end!\n\nFelwood is better to grind than Winterspring. In Felwood (north) the mobs are easier, the respawns are faster, and there are a lot more of them about so you are not always in contention with others. Take breaks, switch location, do instances\/quests or just log off and do something else anytime you feel fustrated, there is no rush! :)\n\n[u]Quests\/Feathers\/Beads Advice[\/u] \nYou will need 2100 Feathers or Beads to go from Revered to Exalted. Lots of people keep saying save them and they are absolutely right. The Feather\/Bead grind during Revered is insanely painful, don't make that mistake, have them ready if you plan to go to Exalted. \n\nAlso, save your quests and totems for revered too if you find you fall short on feathers when you get there.\n\n[u]Loot[\/u]\nDuring this grind fest I mostly looted stuff that only the vendor wanted. Hundreads of greys, many greens, few blues, 1 elemental card, and 1 epic - Dwarven Hand Cannon ([url=http:\/\/70.85.133.74\/?i=17204]http:\/\/70.85.133.74\/?i=17204[\/url]). Runecloth fell like rain and strangely enough so did tasty Plantains, yum! :)\n\nOh yeh, not forgetting the two dozen Living Legging patterns which regularly became vendor food. \n\nTo summarise my profits, I had enough for a fast mount and even some left over to splash out on some Fire resistant gear for MC at the auction house. \n\n[u]But what about the trinket![\/u]\nIt's a very useful epic trinket, completely worth the grind in my opinion. Your guardian lasts [u]30 seconds[\/u], (yes THIRTY not 20 as everyone is saying - i've timed it exactly). He heals as well as doing a fair amount of damage. He is very situational in use, his best use is to assist you\/your group in a hard difficult fight preferably from range.\n\nI took him to scarlet side strat...\nOur priest was struggling to heal at one point so I summoned him and he immediately started to help heal our melee guys. You can not believe the pride I felt, it was so fricken sweet!\n\nWhether your guardian fights, heals or does both depends on the situation. He will usually get several heals\/lighting off before leaving.\n\nHe is very weak and can be killed quite easily by most normal lv60 mobs. \n\n[b]Your Timbermaw Guardian will not crucify your enemies.[\/b]\nHis damage is nice and crits sometimes but is nothing to write home about.\n\nFor him to take offensive action YOU need to have been personally aggro'd by any mob thats still alive when you summon him. If there is no current or past aggro he will stand there scratching his ass or help heal your group members if they are or fall below 50% health. \n\n[u]Closing and why its worth it[\/u]\nThe main thing is this isn't a trinket anyone can get with a roll in an instance or with several hundred gold at the auction house. Defender of the Timbermaw has to be EARNT and is unique for that very reason. Rest assured you will probably be one of a few handful on your entire server with it.\n\nEven if you don't use it much, it is a useful short term assistant healer when things are going horribly wrong for your group. A couple of heals can make the difference between loosing your tank and getting the group wiped or saving your tank just long enough for your priest to sort himself (herself) out.\n\nBeing exalted with the Timbermaw is also something to relish, currently there are no patterns\/recipes etc at exalted level but will be in the future.\n\nYou can also help yourself to chests from Timbermaw camps in Azshara. They will growl but thats all they will do, you have earned the right to take what you want and they damn well know it. :)\n\n[b]Honoured in Ironforge![\/b]\n[url=http:\/\/img200.imageshack.us\/img200\/2176\/pira5bz.jpg]http:\/\/img200.imageshack.us\/img200\/2176\/pira5bz.jpg[\/url]\n\n[b]Extra crispy, lightning fried polar bear coming right up![\/b]\n[url=http:\/\/img409.imageshack.us\/img409\/7840\/pira21hj.jpg]http:\/\/img409.imageshack.us\/img409\/7840\/pira21hj.jpg[\/url]\n\nYour Timbermaw Guardian's job is to [b]assist[\/b] you in certain situations not pwn\/save the day.

I have to say I love it, and I think for my class its the best trinket available.&nbsp; I know those are powerful words for such a subtle trinket,&nbsp; but I have found its the only �summon� trinket that can only help...&nbsp; It cannot possibly break CC ( I have tested this with Wyveren sting, if the Ancestor is actively attacking a mob and I sleep it in-between its lightning bolts, it will stop attacking.&nbsp; The barov peasant caller and mechanical dragons from engineering, however, will continue attacking a CC�d target)&nbsp; It will do a reasonable amount of damage and heal for a small but useful amount most of the time a player (or pet) is below 50%.&nbsp; &nbsp; Its a great little pet shaman..&nbsp; Yes, shaman, its casts healing wave and lighting bolt (Nature damage).&nbsp; \n\nBut in reading the comments here I noticed no one really went into detail about its behavior, sad, since its this trinkets behavior that makes it truly worth the time, and the slot (at least while playing a hunter).&nbsp; So here I go...\n\nRaw Stats:\n\nAverage heal: (about 2 sec cast) 513hp \nAverage lighting&nbsp; bolt damage:&nbsp; (about 2 sec cast)&nbsp; 264&nbsp; (It seems to do more damage now, post 2.0)&nbsp; \nAverage melee damage: 85 (against targets with essentially no armor)\n\nBehavior:\n\nIf a target is immune to nature damage it will not cast lighting bolt, rather it will run up to the target and whack it.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; There seems to be a hierarchy to what, and who, it will heal.&nbsp; I will create a hypothetical situation here to explain it.&nbsp; Lets say your in a raid of 10 people, and everyone is reduced to 40% heath, but there are no enemies attacking any members of the raid at the moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Ancestor will first and foremost heal the person who summoned it, then their pet if they have one.&nbsp; Then people in your party, then raid.&nbsp; There seems to be a 1\/2 second delay before it starts healing, adding 1\/2 of a second before it starts healing for every step down this chain the target is.&nbsp; This means that it will take at least 2 seconds for it to start healing if the target is in your raid group but not in your party, and if there is something attacking you it will nearly always attack your foe before healing out of your party.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; &nbsp; It doesn't matter to the Ancestor how low a targets health is, as long as its below 50% its eligible for a heal, and then it follows the hierarchy described above.&nbsp; So lets say that I am at 40% health and my party member or pet is at 10%, I the summoner,&nbsp; will receive a heal first.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; It cannot always be relied upon to act.&nbsp; On a couple of occasions it has glitched out and done nothing.&nbsp; It may very well chose to dps an aggressor over healing my pet or myself if one of us is below 50%.&nbsp; &nbsp; But if neither I, my pet, or a party or raid member are in combat but are below 50% health, it will always start to heal.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike what was said in a earlier post, it will not cancel a heal being cast if its target goes above 50% health, it will finish the heal once started even if that results in a overheal.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; The person who said that this trinket could do damage to a bubbled pally lied out his ass.&nbsp; I realy wish he was telling the truth though :)&nbsp; &nbsp; ---&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its spell criticals follow a normal damage\/heal curve, a critical is roughly double what the heal or damage would have been.&nbsp; I have never observed a melee critical to date,&nbsp; but I believe its possible.&nbsp; Its critical hit rate with spells is pathetically low.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; It has on a couple of occasions begun defending a party member, even when I was not in combat.&nbsp; Its actions in such a case will cause you to enter combat.&nbsp; \n\nAnd now for some hunter specific stuff:\n\nIt will defend your pet just the same as it will defend you.&nbsp; You can also depend on it to heal your pet, as its second on the ancestor�s priority list.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; Its dps is slightly less than the average hunter, so if you want to heal&nbsp; your pet without losing overall dps, summon it and keep your pet around or above 50%...&nbsp; very useful on tough mobs.&nbsp; \n\nAnd some fight specific stuff:&nbsp; \n\nSummon your little shaman immediately after Hakkar finishes life drain.&nbsp; On several occasions the ancestor has saved people before they die should they get corrupted blood before the drain,&nbsp; and his dps is appreciated.&nbsp; On the Bat boss in ZG,&nbsp; try to summon it before she goes phase 2...&nbsp; the Ancestor seems to be a favorite target for the bat fire bombs.&nbsp; &nbsp; Any time in the kirrinoxx-however-you-spell-it fight is a great time to summon this little guy, especially as a hunter, he will keep your pet up and dps the boss.&nbsp; Same goes for Mandokir.&nbsp; &nbsp; And its really funny to see this little dude chasing Ossiarin around...&nbsp; and actually doing respectable damage to him, especially if Ossiarin has the nature damage debuff on.&nbsp; &nbsp; And dont bother summing him to help with the wind or stone templars...&nbsp; they are immune to nature damage, and the wind one will often do a chain lighting that wipes him out.&nbsp; \n\n...And there...&nbsp; I have said it.&nbsp; This information is valid to the best of my knolege as of Dec 27, 2006.&nbsp; I dont know if anyone will find this useful, but its now perminatly in your brains, so there.&nbsp;

I farm with about 6k health, 1k AP, and a 1h.  I do ok dmg (170dps) and take in very little dmg.  I say this only so you can guage my review for my spec as a warrior.  PVE for me is simply comparing the % in dmg I am taking vs % of dmg I am doing.  There is very little burst dmg against me or from me.\n\nThat said let me review the process of farming the rep, getting the trinket and using the trinket.\n\nFarming: \nFor a prot warrior this is long and boring.  My best mech for this was kill the elite winterfall chief every 8 minutes from the 25 rep if you are lucky he and his two buddies will have 3 beads on them for a total of 55 rep.  Then in between the chief kills kill as many furblog as you can and be back in the cave for the pop.  I did all this solo for many many hours.  If you have a group and they dont mind you collecting all the beads then that is great, otherwise I don't know how much value it has once past revered.\n\nAlso, I have not seen too many more beneficial farming spots for a warrior then the furbolgs even without the rep.  The firewater, major health potions, and winterfall juju's that drop are all beneficial to a warrior.  I also made quiet a bit of money doing this which I used to buy coins for zg (got exalted) and AD quest items.\n\nGetting the trinket:\nDoing the final quest is a little anti-climatic at least for us.  I got some help from the guild and we pwned the demon with a 5 man grp (MC gear).  Oh well a rare and hard fight might have been fun.  Once you get it, you go to your king and he announces your name to the whole city much like an Ony kill and you will get tells grating you from all over, especially from the people who have done this quest.  This alone may have made the work worthwhile.\n\nThe Trinket:\nThe earlier reviews of this are dead on as to the power dmg and healing.  I got to say this is a great trinket PVE wise, and my only wish were that it had a 5 minute cooldown or something.  With the 10m I usually have it when I want but end up using it less just in case the next fight is harder.  My 3m trinkets get poped right when they are available.\n\nAfter having the furbolg done I needed something new to farm so I went to Silithus to work on Combat Badges.  My first ones were farming the Hive zoram elites.  So I again went solo.  In a typical fight that I use the trinket I can expect 1500 healing and 1000 dmg from it.  He wont last if attacked, but I'm a prot warrior and holding agro is what i do.  To me a 2500 swing in a fight is hugely valuable.  He won't heal straight off the bat usually so dont pop him at 5% health.  He seems to have 3 trigger points at which he decides if he should heal, although I have had him heal me 4 times when a fight ended early.  I like to use him when my health minus dmg over 20s is less then 50% minus 1500 (1500 health for me).  This will leave me at 50% if done perfect with out risking my death and maximize his abilities.  He can also be usefull to pop right when you hit last stand...\n\nAlso this is just a fun trinket to have.  So in short fun to get, fun to have, beneficial to farm, beneficial to have.  I have no other trinkets that will providde 2500 health value in healing and dmg in a fight.  I now have stacks and stacks of eko's and firewaters, provided tons of runecloth to my guildees (or you could sell or turn in for rep), and got an orb of deception and a kroll blade out of it too (sold the kroll FTW).","date":"2006-08-07T17:27:28-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"popgea","importedSubject":"The eatmorechikn review:"},{"commentv2":1,"number":31,"id":3085534,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Whats the cooldown on the Trinket, I wouldnt mind getting one for my warrior. he especially needs healing in most cases.\n\n+ whats the damage he heals? 200 300?","date":"2006-05-26T17:22:50-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Item Level: 62 \nMerchant Sell Price: 3 59 65 \nMerchant Buy Price: 89 91 \nCooldown: 10 minutes \nSubmit a screenshot of this item \n\nThe cooldown says 10 minutes.","creationdate":"2006-05-26T20:04:00-05:00","id":1287595,"rating":-1,"commentid":3085534,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"AddictedFanatic","importedSubject":"RE: cooldown and healing amount"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"AdamusPhatamus","importedSubject":"cooldown and healing amount"},{"commentv2":1,"number":32,"id":3085535,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"The Grind\n\nI think the reputation grinding process has been covered else where so I'll concentrate on the timbermaw trinket itself.

Your name will be announced all over Orgrimmar and you will get extra reputation.\n\n\nThe Trinket\n\nThe Timbermaw Defender is the cutest trinket ever and it rocks! Here are the facts. The trinket acts like a pet. When you put it on there is a 30 sec activation before you can use it so you have to plan ahead a little when using this. It has a 10 mins cooldown and will cool down no matter if you have it on you or keep it in your bags. When you do activate it it lasts for 20 sec and that may not sound of much but let me tell you it is! It will fire SEVERAL lighting bolts at your enemies AND heal you SEVERAL times if you are injured.\n\n\nThe Healing\n\nIt will cast several healing waves on you in battle if you are injured. Testing shows about two healing waves pr battle and anything from 900 - 1300 health on average. The healing is instantaneous.\n\n\nThe Damage\n\nIt will fire several lightning bolts (nature damage) at your enemy. Between three and six lightning bolts pr battle which is about 800 - 1800 damage on average. The bolts will sometimes crit for about double damage. Sometimes the timbermaw will also hit the enemy with its staff for a small amount of damage ;o)\n\nEdited, Thu Jan 26 03:43:06 2006","date":"2006-01-26T10:39:38-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"FjalarTH","importedSubject":"Defender of the Timbermaw - The Facts"},{"commentv2":1,"number":33,"id":3085536,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Can the healer die?","date":"2006-02-11T22:20:36-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"solitudethedude","importedSubject":"?"},{"commentv2":1,"number":34,"id":3085537,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"do you need 50 mana to use the trinket?

I must have turned in 500 feathers before I knew to save them for revered.  Sucks I know.  As for the grind I tried to divide my time between Felwood and Winterspring so as not to go insane from the monotony. \n\n Winterfall tends to stay a little less congested but the mobs are like 2-3 levels higher which takes them a bit longer to kill overall, and there is a lot of brutal competition to tag the High Chief in the cave.  I've seen a player of the same faction watch another die in there so they can snag the kill, and yes it can be a tough fight after the umpteenth time.  Fortunately the Everlook graveyard is very close.\n\nFelpaw Village I think has more mobs to kill but there are more players in the 50-55 range who can't get through the post yet.  However they're usually doing the quests or trying to get a friendly rating so you can turn these players to your advantage by grouping with them and most will let you have all the feathers.  Also if you have the Cleansing Felwood quest and the beacon on you then you will get corrupted shard drops as well and end up with all the salve you need.  This is especially good because there is a Corrupted Songflower right in the NW corner and the buff is very helpful for grinding faster.  Chieftain Bloodmaw also gives you 25 rep per kill but he is not elite like the High Chief.  By far the two worst things about doing this in Felwood is the curses and adds which don't happen in Winterfall, and can be VERY annoying after a while.\n\nThis was easily the longest grind I've done in the game, but the trinket is worth it to me.  If he does one wrath and one heal he has done his job IMO, and if not then it's only 10 minutes until he can have another go at it.  Besides all that people see it, immediately want to get their own, then consider how ridiculously long it's going to take to get it.  And then all they can do is be jealous.  kek.","date":"2007-01-15T19:32:08-06:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"kobayashimaru","importedSubject":"Woo Hoo!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":41,"id":3085546,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"This is a really fun trinket to use. Previous posts have already detailed what this trinket does, so I won't bother repeating what has already been said.\n\nAs a caster I often summon this little guy to help with the casting\/healing (it does both well, as it will heal not only you, but members of your party as well, including your pet). It really shined today during an Ossirian raid when I summoned him when Ossirian became weak to nature magic.\n\nJust a couple rules of thumb to maximize this trinket's use.\n\n[b]1.[\/b] NEVER use this trinket when facing enemies that use AoE. It will die, almost instantly, every time. It has next to no HP.\n\n[b]2.[\/b] The summoned Ancestor will only heal if you or someone in your party drops below 50% HPs. It will only attack a target which has previously attacked you. This pet is strictly in defensive mode.\n\n[b]Note:[\/b] For us casters, I recently discovered a way to get around the latter restriction and have the Ancestor attack a target even if it has never touched you. Before summoning him, attack your target from a distance using [url=\/item=11905]Linken's Boomerang[\/url]. A side effect of that trinket is that when the boomerang returns to you it will cause all defensive mode pets to attack your target, including the Timbermaw Ancestor. This technique is especially nice during boss battles when the LAST thing you want to do is allow the mob to hit you. :)\n\n[b]3.[\/b] ALWAYS remember to \/thank your Timbermaw Ancestor if it's still around after battle, then proceed to link the trinket in chat windows and say \"bet you wish you had one of these, huh?\" :p\n\nI know this isn't exactly the best trinket in the game but it's certainly one of the most fun. IMO it's really worth getting, if only for the fact that relatively few people have one. It shows that you accomplished something and makes you a little unique.","date":"2006-06-30T07:38:40-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"psyonide","importedSubject":"Awesome trinket, and fun!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":42,"id":3085548,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I can only see getting this at 47-48 at the earliest.  Here is my suggestion on how this can be accomplished.\n\n1.  Always have a level 70 in your group.  My choice was a 70 Priest.  It was simple to pull 6-12 at a time and use Holy Nova.  I farmed almost exclusively in the northern camps.  Use Mana Burn on the Shamans to round them up easier.\n\n2.  Don't bother to start grinding rep until you have completed Deadwood of the North.  This is from Nafien just outside the Timbermaw Hold in northern Felwood.  Level 45 is the earliest you can get this if I recall.  This will allow you to collect Deadwood Headdress Feathers.\n\n3.  Do not complete any other Timbermaw quests until you reach revered.  That includes the quests from the repeatable turnin of Deadwood Headdress Feathers.  Save those feathers for turnin at revered only.  Save the items that the Deadwood drop that start quests also until revered.  Believe me this will reduce the number of feathers you will need to get from revered to exalted.\n\n4.  Try to complete the grind with as little rest experience bonus as possible.  I typically logged at the end of each session in the middle of the pond at the camps.\n\nYou will need around 1200 feathers for revered to exalted.  This depends on how often you were able to kill the named Chiefs of the camps and if you waited to complete the remaining quests.  The chiefs provide slightly more rep when killed and still provide rep into revered.  Feathers have stack sizes of 250 so they won't take up much room in your bank.  Note also that the feathers are bind on pickup so you must be nearby when the Deadwood die to collect them.\n\nTheoretically you could get exalted at a very low level but the massive number of times you would have to kill the named chiefs would be rediculous.\n\nNote:  Do not wait till you are 48 or 49 to do this quest.  You will get too much experience and not have the trinket until the 50s.\n\n\n\n[i][small]Edited, Jun 24th 2007  2:07am by jacobladder[\/small][\/i]","date":"2007-04-04T12:10:30-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"jacobladder","importedSubject":"My 49 Undead Rogue has this now."},{"commentv2":1,"number":43,"id":3085551,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"The timbermaw is up about 20-30 seconds and the cooldown is 10 min.\n\nLightning bolts hits for 250~ and heals for 500~.\n\n\nnot really worth the grinding imo.","date":"2006-01-05T05:52:27-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I just started with gaining rep last night.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'd been revered with Timbermaw for a long while, so grinding to exalted wasn't that bad (especially now that they drop runecloth).<br /><br />The trinket isn't exactly a lifesaver, but it's quite helpful.&nbsp; Like has been said, he shoots lightning bolts for 300 and heals for 500, and he'll typically get 4 or 5 of either spells off in the 20 seconds he stays.<br /><br />As for his healing, from my experience he has a tendancy to shoot lightning much more than heal, even when I'm on the verge of death.&nbsp; So people who view this guy as an extra heal potion might be disappointed.<br /><br />Anyway, he's not going to turn the tides of a one-sided battle, but in close fights he'll definitely give you an edge.&nbsp; Plus, he's just about the coolest looking pet in the game, a demonic little winterfall totemic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Hello I'm from the Greymane server and just got this trinket last night. I thought I would share a little concept here for anybody whom whishes to botain this trinket. <br /><br />I got form hated - revered in one week or actually a little less. How I did I do it you ask? wel if you didn't im going to tell you anyways.<br /><br />Basically In order to get hated - revered reputation all you have to do is throw a raid. During a raid group you still obtain the normal 5 rep per kill. You just gain the reputation alot faster then normal. This has been tested and is true. Once I threw the first raid it became a major hit on ther server or at least the alliance side. Once I threw teh first one each time i messaged people tehy joined asap. If you can get a raid going youll be able to gain rep faster then ever before! i got form hated to revered in 10 hours! then in took me a week to get form revered - exalted. <br /><br />Oh and let me clear up a few things for everybody :)<br /><br />- You stop getting reputation points once you hit revered. The only way to gian reputation at this point is through collecting Feathers/Beads. You can also complete a few quest but tehy only give you 100-150 reputation so if your in a raid save these quest for when the raid dies since you don't get and points for your kills to complete the quest in a raid group. REP DOES NOT STOP /1 THROUGH HONORED AS SOME BELEIVE.<br /><br />- Named mobs will give you 15 reputation points no matter waht your faction is currently at. if you are revered you still get 15rep per kill of a named mob<br /><br />- The ancestor in fact does only stick around for an everage of 20 seconds. heals for normally 400 damage and does magic damage or anywhere from 230-330 that i have seen so far. The timbermaw is very weak as it dies fast but it is extremly cool to have! furries!<br /><br />One other cool thing that i really wish i realised prior to handing in the final quest and I'll let you all know. Once you are given the quest for teh trinket and you complete and get your trinket. The Timbermaw leader tells you that if you are form the Allaince then peace is brough. The quest ask you to go speak with King Bronzebeard.<br /><br />Once you go speak to king bronzebeard he makes a speech to all of Ironfroge literally stating that you are a hero of ironforge and the allaince! that you have gone past teh call of duty in diplomacy and have earned an alliance with the Timbermaw on behalf of us all! It's actually a really good speech ad he says your name out loud and ask people to cheer you you and etc. That was very very cool and i wish i would have known prior to or i would have waited until later tonight! If you want fame on your server wait for a friday night and complete the quest lol! It was tons of fun and alot of omg! whispered to me lol.<br /><br />Oh and teh quest also gives you 9999xp 400rep with bboth ironforge/stormwind and something else i beleive but i cant remember.<br /><br />Well thats all the info I have and should be good enough to get you on your way! jsut keep in mind if you are trying for teh trinket you arent ttrying to get it because its Elite! your trying to get it because youll be one of teh fewq on your server with it! there are currently 2 ppl on my server with it and im one of them lol. <br /><br />Oh and i have one question lol.. I got exaulted and then it sets rep to.. well waht mine was cause i had a little extra feathers was to 35/1000? Id this strange i thought so? &gt;&lt;<br /><br />Hope this helps a little and by the way! this is my first post on thottbot! woot woot!<br /><br />Elura~~<br />Server: Greymane</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Grind <br /><br />I think the reputation grinding process has been covered else where so I'll concentrate on the timbermaw trinket itself. Just remember one thing: keep the feathers from Felwood or the beads from Winterspring (both soulbound) in the bank and use them when you no longer get rep from killing mobs - it will shave a big chunk of the 21000 points needed to go from revered to exalted. <br /><br />The Quest <br /><br />When you do get exalted with the Timbermaw Hold - One Eye Gorn in the timbermaw tunnel will give you The Root of All Evil (elite) quest and a torch. Gather some friends and go to Timbermaw Village just east of Everlook. Use the torch in the cave to summon the demon that has been corrupting the timbermaws and kill it. Get the Essence of Xandivious quest item from the basket and return to One Eye Gorn to recive your Defender of the Timbermaw epic trinket. Now go to Orgrimmar and speak with Thrall. Your name will be announced all over Orgrimmar and you will get extra reputation. <br /><br />The Trinket <br /><br />The Timbermaw Defender is the cutest trinket ever and it rocks! Here are the facts. The trinket acts like a pet. When you put it on there is a 30 sec activation before you can use it so you have to plan ahead a little when using this. It has a 10 mins cooldown and will cool down no matter if you have it on you or keep it in your bags. When you do activate it it lasts for 20 sec and that may not sound of much but let me tell you it is! It will fire SEVERAL lighting bolts at your enemies AND heal you SEVERAL times if you are injured. <br /><br />The Healing <br /><br />It will cast several healing waves on you in battle if you are injured. Testing shows about two healing waves pr battle and anything from 900 - 1300 health on average. The healing is instantaneous. <br /><br />The Damage <br /><br />It will fire several lightning bolts (nature damage) at your enemy. Between three and six lightning bolts pr battle which is about 800 - 1800 damage on average. The bolts will sometimes crit for about double damage. Also the timbermaw defender will sometimes hit the enemy with its staff for a small amount of damage ;o)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to let everybody know even though the post doesnt ask for it. If you are good at organizing events and such you can get fromHated - Revered very fast. So fast it should honestly take you about 10-12 hours only. <br /><br />Simply contruct a raid and head to north felwood. Try to keep the raid 20+ people and have a warlock in your party incase people wanan join form IF and etc. <br /><br />If you are good at keeping riads alive and good at ggetting peoples interest you can get revered easily. Or semi easily I suppose lol. <br /><br />I ran&nbsp; raid and it lasted 53 1/2 hours and had a total of 2,500+ people join ti during its lifespan. It was a great achievment and im currently known all over my server for it and other raids. Anyhow that was besides the point get a good raid started and rep wont be a problem for you. <br /><br />As well if there are others around teh area for example I am alliance and a 5 man group of horde came to farm vs our 20 man raid... if you are on pve then simply tag kils and tehy will get annoyed and ehad to south base.. if you are on pvp then just kill them :P <br /><br />The hardest parts with reputation is getting Exalted. In order to get exalted you need to collect a total amount of 2100 feathers. The feathers drop much more frequently in north base then the south and you can gain them alot fast being solo or having a guild group of 5 people on ffa. <br /><br />I was howevor very lucky.. because i hleped hundreds on my server achieve revered and probally around 1500 achieve honored. I was easily able to make a raid group of 20+ people that allowed me to loot all the feathers. Even with 20 people working for me it still took around 40 hours to collect all the feathers... So dont think its any easy task cause it does take forevor to get form revered-exalted. <br /><br />let me clear some facts for incase anybody ask. <br /><br />1) the Timbermaw summons only for 30 seconds and fights/heals <br /><br />2) timbermaw heals for around 700-800 normally. Also hits for about 300-400 magic damage. <br /><br />3) the cooldown is 10 minutes long <br /><br />yes the trinket does lack a few thingss for teh work but keep in mind.. If you are going after a epic super elite trinket this isnt the one for you. If you after a trinket that nobody else will have then this is the thing for you. Plus its purple. Only 2 people on my server have it to date and im one of them. As well Magir Bronzebeard or w/e announces you are a Hero of the allaince upon completeing the final part of the triket quest so dont hand it in until the server is buy <br /><br />Elura~~ <br />Server: Greymane</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>After having him for ahwile here are my thoughts...<br /><br />He will not attack a mob unless you have already been attacked by it.&nbsp; So many times he will stand there only to disappear in 20 seconds, unless you summon him after you've already been attacked.&nbsp; This makes it tough to use him in PvE, especially if your a caster as generally you want to avoid any kind of damage that would cause the furbolg to help.<br /><br />He dies extremely easily.&nbsp; Don't even consider trying to use him if your fighting a boss or mage using any type of AoE. <br /><br />He will do damage WAY before he will ever heal you.&nbsp; He does do an occasional heal but only if you are very low and even then you can not depend on it.<br /><br />That being said...<br /><br />He is definately usefull in PvP.&nbsp; Often times he will confuse opponents.&nbsp; I cast him after I take a hit.&nbsp; Iceblock, and he'll sit there attacking the enemy all the while I'm invulnerable.&nbsp; As soon as the enemy targets the fubolg, break the ice block and nuke.&nbsp; Fun times. <br /><br />The king/warchief yelling your name is very cool.&nbsp; You'll get lots of tells.<br /><br />When people inspect me it draws lots of &quot;omg how did you get that&quot;&nbsp; which can be fun and annoying at the same time.<br /><br />All in all the trinket is very situational.&nbsp; IMO much better in PvP than PvE.&nbsp; Either way if your going for this trinket cause you think it may own so much, don't.&nbsp; There are MANY better trinkets in the game that can fill this ones roll.&nbsp; However like some this is one that I just had to have and am glad that I do.&nbsp; Having something that hardly anyone else has is fun.&nbsp; It takes an extremely long time to get, but imo this is one of the coolest trinkets I've seen in the game to date.<br /><br />~Dazl<br />Burning Blade</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No need to cover the grinding part, you can tell from above how long it takes. So many beads and feathers you could go blind. <br /><br />That being said, there are some resources to be had along the way. Both camps drop a lot of runecloth, potions, scrolls, and of course the occasional blue or purple. Heck, a Destiny dropped for us on the last week of grinding.<br /><br />As posted above, when you hit exalted, you get one quest, to plant the torch in the mouth of the chiefs cave and summon the demon. What you don't know is that the demon spawns down the hill behind you! Xanivicious is a 62 Elite demon identical in look to the demons that drop Felcloth in Felwood. When the quest says &quot;bring a few friends&quot;, bring 5-10, just to be sure. I went in with 2 others, with a 3rd joining, and he tore us apart.<br /><br />He has three different attacks:<br /><br />1. Hits for 200-300 on swing.<br />2. Dots you with poison.<br />3. Hits you with an armor acid.<br /><br />Within 4 times of dying (60 Paladin) against this guy, I had lost total durability on Chest, weapon, and shoulders. He also heals very fast, so hit him hard with one group.<br /><br />And for those mischevious types out there, something to note: The demon timeout resets every time he engages a target. If you don't kill him, he just walks around the camp taking a swing at every horde and alliance member that comes by. While we were waiting to assemble our group, Xan killed three horde and a couple farmers who were just star struck at seeing an elite demon in the middle of their area! <br /><br />Also note that if you are in a mini-raid, you have to leave the raid to pick up the basket that the demon drops.<br /><br />So if you don't want to get your trinket right away, keep planting the torch and count how many people get eaten, because you have to turn the torch back in to get the trinket.<br /><br />THE TRINKET:<br /><br />Tough call on this one. All posts above are correct. He lasts for 20 seconds, does decent damage with spell casts, heals you when you drop below 50%, which can be cool. He can also be summoned without a target which can be helpful before a fight or just running around town. He can also accept buffs if you want to keep him around longer. <br /><br />His weakness is just that, he is soft and vulnerable. He is a teddy bear that should not be hit! This is a good trinket when you are fighting a single tough target or PVP. If you are fighting multiple targets, his spells do enough damage to take aggro, and he will go down. My Paladin had to heal him once to keep it in a fight.<br /><br />With a 10 minute cooldown, this can be used a lot, but do not take it into the higher level instances, too much damage being thrown around there, and your teddy bear will take the big dirt nap.<br /><br />I don't regret getting this thing though. People ask about it all the time. Recommended, but just don't expect the end all of trinkets.<br /><br />Mark</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><b>Patch 1.10</b><br />Lv60 Mage<br /><br />The Trinket is only attainable once you become Exalted with the Timbermaw and have slain thier greatest enemy - Xandivious<br />(<a href="http://70.85.133.74/?n=992074" rel="nofollow">http://70.85.133.74/?n=992074</a>).<br /><br /><u>The Grind of your life</u><br />I went from Hostile to Exalted in 3 weeks of very hard (mostly solo) grinding in the northern village of Felwood (south has low drop rate and furbolgs that fear which is annoying). <br /><br />Being a mage, aoe spells helped a lot. I didnt need a group most of the time as I was able to do everything myself. After a few hundred kills you become very fast and efficient at slaughtering entire camps of Furbolgs :)<br /><br /><u>Statistics</u><br />I eventually lost count of how many Deadwood Furbolgs I killed but it was somewhere in the region between 7000 and 10000 maybe more as I foolishly spent a lot of feathers early when I should have saved them.<br /><br /><u>Competition</u><br />When you start out it will be fun to group with others to grind but understand if you plan to get to exalted then grouping is a bad idea (unless they let you have the feathers). It is bad because when you hit Revered you will no longer get rep for kills, only feathers/beads. Drop rate for feathers are about 1:4, with a round robin looting plan you'll be waiting a while for yours.<br /><br /><u>Xandivious</u><br />Xandivious is the Timbermaws greatest enemy. This demon is responsible for corrupting the Deadwood and Winterspring tribes. Xandivious is a Lv 62 Elite demon that does mainly nature damage and has a continuous AOE aura that does 150 damage in quite a large radius. You will need a balanced group to take him and becareful for nearby respawns when fighting him. Nature protection potion and Hunters nature resistance buffs are advisable for a smooth encounter.<br /><b>NOTE:</b> <i>Prior to 1.10 people were saying you still keep the demon summon torch and can use it to harass others in the area after the quest. This is no longer the case, One Eye now takes it back in order to complete the quest.</i><br /><br /><u>Encouragement</u><br />I always came to this page when I needed a morale boost during Revered to Exalted and it helped a lot. I don't know how easy it was before 1.10 but this was incredibly hard, you need a lot of patience and resolve! Keep at it, it is worth it in the end!<br /><br />Felwood is better to grind than Winterspring. In Felwood (north) the mobs are easier, the respawns are faster, and there are a lot more of them about so you are not always in contention with others. Take breaks, switch location, do instances/quests or just log off and do something else anytime you feel fustrated, there is no rush! :)<br /><br /><u>Quests/Feathers/Beads Advice</u> <br />You will need 2100 Feathers or Beads to go from Revered to Exalted. Lots of people keep saying save them and they are absolutely right. The Feather/Bead grind during Revered is insanely painful, don't make that mistake, have them ready if you plan to go to Exalted. <br /><br />Also, save your quests and totems for revered too if you find you fall short on feathers when you get there.<br /><br /><u>Loot</u><br />During this grind fest I mostly looted stuff that only the vendor wanted. Hundreads of greys, many greens, few blues, 1 elemental card, and 1 epic - Dwarven Hand Cannon (<a href="http://70.85.133.74/?i=17204" rel="nofollow">http://70.85.133.74/?i=17204</a>). Runecloth fell like rain and strangely enough so did tasty Plantains, yum! :)<br /><br />Oh yeh, not forgetting the two dozen Living Legging patterns which regularly became vendor food. <br /><br />To summarise my profits, I had enough for a fast mount and even some left over to splash out on some Fire resistant gear for MC at the auction house. <br /><br /><u>But what about the trinket!</u><br />It's a very useful epic trinket, completely worth the grind in my opinion. Your guardian lasts <u>30 seconds</u>, (yes THIRTY not 20 as everyone is saying - i've timed it exactly). He heals as well as doing a fair amount of damage. He is very situational in use, his best use is to assist you/your group in a hard difficult fight preferably from range.<br /><br />I took him to scarlet side strat...<br />Our priest was struggling to heal at one point so I summoned him and he immediately started to help heal our melee guys. You can not believe the pride I felt, it was so fricken sweet!<br /><br />Whether your guardian fights, heals or does both depends on the situation. He will usually get several heals/lighting off before leaving.<br /><br />He is very weak and can be killed quite easily by most normal lv60 mobs. <br /><br /><b>Your Timbermaw Guardian will not crucify your enemies.</b><br />His damage is nice and crits sometimes but is nothing to write home about.<br /><br />For him to take offensive action YOU need to have been personally aggro'd by any mob thats still alive when you summon him. If there is no current or past aggro he will stand there scratching his ass or help heal your group members if they are or fall below 50% health. <br /><br /><u>Closing and why its worth it</u><br />The main thing is this isn't a trinket anyone can get with a roll in an instance or with several hundred gold at the auction house. Defender of the Timbermaw has to be EARNT and is unique for that very reason. Rest assured you will probably be one of a few handful on your entire server with it.<br /><br />Even if you don't use it much, it is a useful short term assistant healer when things are going horribly wrong for your group. A couple of heals can make the difference between loosing your tank and getting the group wiped or saving your tank just long enough for your priest to sort himself (herself) out.<br /><br />Being exalted with the Timbermaw is also something to relish, currently there are no patterns/recipes etc at exalted level but will be in the future.<br /><br />You can also help yourself to chests from Timbermaw camps in Azshara. They will growl but thats all they will do, you have earned the right to take what you want and they damn well know it. :)<br /><br /><b>Honoured in Ironforge!</b><br /><a href="http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/2176/pira5bz.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/2176/pira5bz.jpg</a><br /><br /><b>Extra crispy, lightning fried polar bear coming right up!</b><br /><a href="http://img409.imageshack.us/img409/7840/pira21hj.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img409.imageshack.us/img409/7840/pira21hj.jpg</a><br /><br />Your Timbermaw Guardian's job is to <b>assist</b> you in certain situations not pwn/save the day.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am a 60 hunter, starting to do some endgame material, and have had this trinket for several weeks now.&nbsp; I have to say I love it, and I think for my class its the best trinket available.&nbsp; I know those are powerful words for such a subtle trinket,&nbsp; but I have found its the only �summon� trinket that can only help...&nbsp; It cannot possibly break CC ( I have tested this with Wyveren sting, if the Ancestor is actively attacking a mob and I sleep it in-between its lightning bolts, it will stop attacking.&nbsp; The barov peasant caller and mechanical dragons from engineering, however, will continue attacking a CC�d target)&nbsp; It will do a reasonable amount of damage and heal for a small but useful amount most of the time a player (or pet) is below 50%.&nbsp; &nbsp; Its a great little pet shaman..&nbsp; Yes, shaman, its casts healing wave and lighting bolt (Nature damage).&nbsp; <br /><br />But in reading the comments here I noticed no one really went into detail about its behavior, sad, since its this trinkets behavior that makes it truly worth the time, and the slot (at least while playing a hunter).&nbsp; So here I go...<br /><br />Raw Stats:<br /><br />Average heal: (about 2 sec cast) 513hp <br />Average lighting&nbsp; bolt damage:&nbsp; (about 2 sec cast)&nbsp; 264&nbsp; (It seems to do more damage now, post 2.0)&nbsp; <br />Average melee damage: 85 (against targets with essentially no armor)<br /><br />Behavior:<br /><br />If a target is immune to nature damage it will not cast lighting bolt, rather it will run up to the target and whack it.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; There seems to be a hierarchy to what, and who, it will heal.&nbsp; I will create a hypothetical situation here to explain it.&nbsp; Lets say your in a raid of 10 people, and everyone is reduced to 40% heath, but there are no enemies attacking any members of the raid at the moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Ancestor will first and foremost heal the person who summoned it, then their pet if they have one.&nbsp; Then people in your party, then raid.&nbsp; There seems to be a 1/2 second delay before it starts healing, adding 1/2 of a second before it starts healing for every step down this chain the target is.&nbsp; This means that it will take at least 2 seconds for it to start healing if the target is in your raid group but not in your party, and if there is something attacking you it will nearly always attack your foe before healing out of your party.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; &nbsp; It doesn't matter to the Ancestor how low a targets health is, as long as its below 50% its eligible for a heal, and then it follows the hierarchy described above.&nbsp; So lets say that I am at 40% health and my party member or pet is at 10%, I the summoner,&nbsp; will receive a heal first.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; It cannot always be relied upon to act.&nbsp; On a couple of occasions it has glitched out and done nothing.&nbsp; It may very well chose to dps an aggressor over healing my pet or myself if one of us is below 50%.&nbsp; &nbsp; But if neither I, my pet, or a party or raid member are in combat but are below 50% health, it will always start to heal.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike what was said in a earlier post, it will not cancel a heal being cast if its target goes above 50% health, it will finish the heal once started even if that results in a overheal.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; The person who said that this trinket could do damage to a bubbled pally lied out his ass.&nbsp; I realy wish he was telling the truth though :)&nbsp; &nbsp; ---&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its spell criticals follow a normal damage/heal curve, a critical is roughly double what the heal or damage would have been.&nbsp; I have never observed a melee critical to date,&nbsp; but I believe its possible.&nbsp; Its critical hit rate with spells is pathetically low.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; It has on a couple of occasions begun defending a party member, even when I was not in combat.&nbsp; Its actions in such a case will cause you to enter combat.&nbsp; <br /><br />And now for some hunter specific stuff:<br /><br />It will defend your pet just the same as it will defend you.&nbsp; You can also depend on it to heal your pet, as its second on the ancestor�s priority list.&nbsp; ---&nbsp; Its dps is slightly less than the average hunter, so if you want to heal&nbsp; your pet without losing overall dps, summon it and keep your pet around or above 50%...&nbsp; very useful on tough mobs.&nbsp; <br /><br />And some fight specific stuff:&nbsp; <br /><br />Summon your little shaman immediately after Hakkar finishes life drain.&nbsp; On several occasions the ancestor has saved people before they die should they get corrupted blood before the drain,&nbsp; and his dps is appreciated.&nbsp; On the Bat boss in ZG,&nbsp; try to summon it before she goes phase 2...&nbsp; the Ancestor seems to be a favorite target for the bat fire bombs.&nbsp; &nbsp; Any time in the kirrinoxx-however-you-spell-it fight is a great time to summon this little guy, especially as a hunter, he will keep your pet up and dps the boss.&nbsp; Same goes for Mandokir.&nbsp; &nbsp; And its really funny to see this little dude chasing Ossiarin around...&nbsp; and actually doing respectable damage to him, especially if Ossiarin has the nature damage debuff on.&nbsp; &nbsp; And dont bother summing him to help with the wind or stone templars...&nbsp; they are immune to nature damage, and the wind one will often do a chain lighting that wipes him out.&nbsp; <br /><br />...And there...&nbsp; I have said it.&nbsp; This information is valid to the best of my knolege as of Dec 27, 2006.&nbsp; I dont know if anyone will find this useful, but its now perminatly in your brains, so there.&nbsp; Mu ha ha ha.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>So first off I am a Horde Prot Warrior (15/5/31) 8/8 T1 with just about all the other T1 items for tanking and very few dps items. I farm with about 6k health, 1k AP, and a 1h. I do ok dmg (170dps) and take in very little dmg. I say this only so you can guage my review for my spec as a warrior. PVE for me is simply comparing the % in dmg I am taking vs % of dmg I am doing. There is very little burst dmg against me or from me.<br /><br />That said let me review the process of farming the rep, getting the trinket and using the trinket.<br /><br />Farming: <br />For a prot warrior this is long and boring. My best mech for this was kill the elite winterfall chief every 8 minutes from the 25 rep if you are lucky he and his two buddies will have 3 beads on them for a total of 55 rep. Then in between the chief kills kill as many furblog as you can and be back in the cave for the pop. I did all this solo for many many hours. If you have a group and they dont mind you collecting all the beads then that is great, otherwise I don't know how much value it has once past revered.<br /><br />Also, I have not seen too many more beneficial farming spots for a warrior then the furbolgs even without the rep. The firewater, major health potions, and winterfall juju's that drop are all beneficial to a warrior. I also made quiet a bit of money doing this which I used to buy coins for zg (got exalted) and AD quest items.<br /><br />Getting the trinket:<br />Doing the final quest is a little anti-climatic at least for us. I got some help from the guild and we pwned the demon with a 5 man grp (MC gear). Oh well a rare and hard fight might have been fun. Once you get it, you go to your king and he announces your name to the whole city much like an Ony kill and you will get tells grating you from all over, especially from the people who have done this quest. This alone may have made the work worthwhile.<br /><br />The Trinket:<br />The earlier reviews of this are dead on as to the power dmg and healing. I got to say this is a great trinket PVE wise, and my only wish were that it had a 5 minute cooldown or something. With the 10m I usually have it when I want but end up using it less just in case the next fight is harder. My 3m trinkets get poped right when they are available.<br /><br />After having the furbolg done I needed something new to farm so I went to Silithus to work on Combat Badges. My first ones were farming the Hive zoram elites. So I again went solo. In a typical fight that I use the trinket I can expect 1500 healing and 1000 dmg from it. He wont last if attacked, but I'm a prot warrior and holding agro is what i do. To me a 2500 swing in a fight is hugely valuable. He won't heal straight off the bat usually so dont pop him at 5% health. He seems to have 3 trigger points at which he decides if he should heal, although I have had him heal me 4 times when a fight ended early. I like to use him when my health minus dmg over 20s is less then 50% minus 1500 (1500 health for me). This will leave me at 50% if done perfect with out risking my death and maximize his abilities. He can also be usefull to pop right when you hit last stand...<br /><br />Also this is just a fun trinket to have. So in short fun to get, fun to have, beneficial to farm, beneficial to have. I have no other trinkets that will providde 2500 health value in healing and dmg in a fight. I now have stacks and stacks of eko's and firewaters, provided tons of runecloth to my guildees (or you could sell or turn in for rep), and got an orb of deception and a kroll blade out of it too (sold the kroll FTW).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Whats the cooldown on the Trinket, I wouldnt mind getting one for my warrior. he especially needs healing in most cases.<br /><br />+ whats the damage he heals? 200 300?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The Grind<br /><br />I think the reputation grinding process has been covered else where so I'll concentrate on the timbermaw trinket itself. Just remember one thing: keep the feathers from Felwood or the beads from Winterspring (both soulbound) in the bank and use them when you no longer get rep from killing mobs - it will shave a big chunk of the 21000 points needed to go from revered to exalted.<br /><br />The Quest<br /><br />When you do get exalted with the Timbermaw Hold One Eye Gorn in the timbermaw tunnel will give you The Root of All Evil (elite) quest and a torch. Gather some friends and go to Timbermaw Village just east of Everlook. Use the torch in the cave to summon the demon that has been corrupting the timbermaws and kill it. Get the Essence of Xandivious quest item from the basket and return to One Eye Gorn to recive your Defender of the Timbermaw epic trinket. Now go to Orgrimmar and speak with Thrall. Your name will be announced all over Orgrimmar and you will get extra reputation.<br /><br />The Trinket<br /><br />The Timbermaw Defender is the cutest trinket ever and it rocks! Here are the facts. The trinket acts like a pet. When you put it on there is a 30 sec activation before you can use it so you have to plan ahead a little when using this. It has a 10 mins cooldown and will cool down no matter if you have it on you or keep it in your bags. When you do activate it it lasts for 20 sec and that may not sound of much but let me tell you it is! It will fire SEVERAL lighting bolts at your enemies AND heal you SEVERAL times if you are injured.<br /><br />The Healing<br /><br />It will cast several healing waves on you in battle if you are injured. Testing shows about two healing waves pr battle and anything from 900 - 1300 health on average. The healing is instantaneous.<br /><br />The Damage<br /><br />It will fire several lightning bolts (nature damage) at your enemy. Between three and six lightning bolts pr battle which is about 800 - 1800 damage on average. The bolts will sometimes crit for about double damage. Sometimes the timbermaw will also hit the enemy with its staff for a small amount of damage ;o)<br /><br />Edited, Thu Jan 26 03:43:06 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>There must be an easier way to get rep beyond revered.. -_-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>FINALLY got mine last night after months of grinding. I must have turned in 500 feathers before I knew to save them for revered. Sucks I know. As for the grind I tried to divide my time between Felwood and Winterspring so as not to go insane from the monotony. <br /><br /> Winterfall tends to stay a little less congested but the mobs are like 2-3 levels higher which takes them a bit longer to kill overall, and there is a lot of brutal competition to tag the High Chief in the cave. I've seen a player of the same faction watch another die in there so they can snag the kill, and yes it can be a tough fight after the umpteenth time. Fortunately the Everlook graveyard is very close.<br /><br />Felpaw Village I think has more mobs to kill but there are more players in the 50-55 range who can't get through the post yet. However they're usually doing the quests or trying to get a friendly rating so you can turn these players to your advantage by grouping with them and most will let you have all the feathers. Also if you have the Cleansing Felwood quest and the beacon on you then you will get corrupted shard drops as well and end up with all the salve you need. This is especially good because there is a Corrupted Songflower right in the NW corner and the buff is very helpful for grinding faster. Chieftain Bloodmaw also gives you 25 rep per kill but he is not elite like the High Chief. By far the two worst things about doing this in Felwood is the curses and adds which don't happen in Winterfall, and can be VERY annoying after a while.<br /><br />This was easily the longest grind I've done in the game, but the trinket is worth it to me. If he does one wrath and one heal he has done his job IMO, and if not then it's only 10 minutes until he can have another go at it. Besides all that people see it, immediately want to get their own, then consider how ridiculously long it's going to take to get it. And then all they can do is be jealous. kek.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a really fun trinket to use. Previous posts have already detailed what this trinket does, so I won't bother repeating what has already been said.<br /><br />As a caster I often summon this little guy to help with the casting/healing (it does both well, as it will heal not only you, but members of your party as well, including your pet). It really shined today during an Ossirian raid when I summoned him when Ossirian became weak to nature magic.<br /><br />Just a couple rules of thumb to maximize this trinket's use.<br /><br /><b>1.</b> NEVER use this trinket when facing enemies that use AoE. It will die, almost instantly, every time. It has next to no HP.<br /><br /><b>2.</b> The summoned Ancestor will only heal if you or someone in your party drops below 50% HPs. It will only attack a target which has previously attacked you. This pet is strictly in defensive mode.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> For us casters, I recently discovered a way to get around the latter restriction and have the Ancestor attack a target even if it has never touched you. Before summoning him, attack your target from a distance using <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11905">Linken's Boomerang</a>. A side effect of that trinket is that when the boomerang returns to you it will cause all defensive mode pets to attack your target, including the Timbermaw Ancestor. This technique is especially nice during boss battles when the LAST thing you want to do is allow the mob to hit you. :)<br /><br /><b>3.</b> ALWAYS remember to /thank your Timbermaw Ancestor if it's still around after battle, then proceed to link the trinket in chat windows and say &quot;bet you wish you had one of these, huh?&quot; :p<br /><br />I know this isn't exactly the best trinket in the game but it's certainly one of the most fun. IMO it's really worth getting, if only for the fact that relatively few people have one. It shows that you accomplished something and makes you a little unique.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I can only see getting this at 47-48 at the earliest. Here is my suggestion on how this can be accomplished.<br /><br />1. Always have a level 70 in your group. My choice was a 70 Priest. It was simple to pull 6-12 at a time and use Holy Nova. I farmed almost exclusively in the northern camps. Use Mana Burn on the Shamans to round them up easier.<br /><br />2. Don't bother to start grinding rep until you have completed Deadwood of the North. This is from Nafien just outside the Timbermaw Hold in northern Felwood. Level 45 is the earliest you can get this if I recall. This will allow you to collect Deadwood Headdress Feathers.<br /><br />3. Do not complete any other Timbermaw quests until you reach revered. That includes the quests from the repeatable turnin of Deadwood Headdress Feathers. Save those feathers for turnin at revered only. Save the items that the Deadwood drop that start quests also until revered. Believe me this will reduce the number of feathers you will need to get from revered to exalted.<br /><br />4. Try to complete the grind with as little rest experience bonus as possible. I typically logged at the end of each session in the middle of the pond at the camps.<br /><br />You will need around 1200 feathers for revered to exalted. This depends on how often you were able to kill the named Chiefs of the camps and if you waited to complete the remaining quests. The chiefs provide slightly more rep when killed and still provide rep into revered. Feathers have stack sizes of 250 so they won't take up much room in your bank. Note also that the feathers are bind on pickup so you must be nearby when the Deadwood die to collect them.<br /><br />Theoretically you could get exalted at a very low level but the massive number of times you would have to kill the named chiefs would be rediculous.<br /><br />Note: Do not wait till you are 48 or 49 to do this quest. You will get too much experience and not have the trinket until the 50s.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jun 24th 2007 2:07am by jacobladder</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The timbermaw is up about 20-30 seconds and the cooldown is 10 min.<br /><br />Lightning bolts hits for 250~ and heals for 500~.<br /><br />not really worth the grinding imo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I think I need 10k rep for this baby..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For those Alliance members interested in gaining rep with the Timbermaw, I suggest that you also work at gaining rep with the Wintersaber Trainers (see <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Wintersaber_Trainers" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Wintersaber_Trainers</a>)<br /><br />At 1500/3000 neutral, you get a quest from the Wintersaber Trainers to kill 5x Ursas and 5x Shamans -- which will give you 50 rep with the Timbermaw until revered. Each time you hand in this quest you will get 50 rep with the Wintersaber trainers. So until revered, your rep with both factions will increase at the same rate. If you're lucky you will have received (and saved up) 2100 beads from killing the Ursas and Shamans. At this point you can continue grinding to get to exhaulted with the Wintersaber Trainers (so you get a rare mount,) and also hand in your 2100 beads to become exhaulted with the Timbermaw. Even if you don't have 2100 beads by the time you hit revered with both factions, you'll definitely have enough beads by the time you reach exhaulted with the Wintersaber Trainers.<br /><br />It's a tough grind, but it seems more worthwhile knowing you can become exhaulted with two factions along the way.<br /><br />Edit: Added reference to &quot;Alliance members&quot; in the first line.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jul 4th 2006 at 12:17pm EDT by DurotanLuciferous</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've just started on my road to the trinket, and in fact don't even have neutral rep with the timbermaw yet, but I found something at WoW Wikki that could be very helpful assuming it's accurate info, but really only if you have a large active guild or you can otherwise manage to get a big group together.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the site's Timbermaw Hold Reputation Guide:<br /><br /><i>&quot;Before you had to hit a Felpaw Furbolg for some type of damage (spell, melee, wand, whatever) in order to get the 5 reputation points for the kill. For this reason raiding or grouping wasnt that effective because everyone had to &quot;tag&quot; the mob with a hit in order to get the credit. Now, you do not have to do anything but be in range of the fight to get the rep point. Thus a raid of 10 players could tear through Felpaw village and rack up massive amounts of reputation in a short amount of time. What people have been doing, is getting a 40man raid up, and sending a third to each of the villages, one to the south felwood, one to the north, and one to winterspring. Perhaps even 2 to winterspring since theres quite a few places you could go.&quot;</i> <br /><br />And they have other suggestions. The url is <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Timbermaw_Hold_reputation_guide" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Timbermaw_Hold_reputation_guide</a><br /><br />Unfortunately, my guild isn't all that big. So, I'll be doing a lot of grinding. That's cool, though, I figure I can keep in the LFG system for ST or BRD while I grind, so just instance and grind, instance and grind, get ganked a few times probably, instance and grind...<br /><br /><i>Edited, Mar 1st 2007 2:05am by Chochak</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have been using this trinket for the last 3 days and to be honest, I didn't like it.<br /><br />1) If you summon him before a fight, it simply stands there and watches as you toil with the mob<br /><br />2) If it's summoned in the previous fight, it will not fight the next fight. It does what I have mentioned in point 1).<br /><br />3) it lasts for about 20 secs, making its use rather limited.<br /><br />4) Its lightning bolts do about 200-300 damages per hit and are quite often resisted (about 30% of the time).<br /><br />5) Its heal probably heals about 1000 hits, which is essentially next to useless.<br /><br />6) you have no control over how, when and on whom to cast his spells.<br /><br />7) the only good thing about him is he is not attackable (as he's in spirit form)</div>
