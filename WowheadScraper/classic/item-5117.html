<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>the faire only comes once a month, for a week, the first week it sets up, and the second monday of that week it sets up i think... anywho, it switches between mulgore and Elwynn forest. the only problem with it is that higher lvls will be grinding lower lvl places for stuff like this to get tickets, so it will be annoying to try and be in the areas with mobs that drop these things because the lvl 60s will be killin everythin in sight =/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually, the 60's will primarily be grinding the Evil Bat Eyes.&nbsp; For each of the five animal parts you can turn in, the lowest options beome unavailable as your reputation with the fair increases.&nbsp; If 60's were relying on Soft Bushy Tails, for example, they'd find after turning in sixty or so that the quest option is no longer available.<br /><br />Of course, with half of the professions offering their own quests with the fair, many players will find it unnecessary to hunt creatures.&nbsp; As a Tailor/Enchanter, however, I currently have no choice but to grind for grey drops...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>was thinking of selling but checkd it out......i found this off the owlbeasts in the hinterlands....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the quickest way to get these with the lowest effort is in The Roguefeather Den in 1k Needles.&nbsp; They respawn in the cave almsost as fast as you can kill them, and you barely have to walk anywhere.&nbsp; The plumes drop about every 3rd one that I've noticed and the harpies are only lvl 28-30 so killing them is simple.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm farming in Feralas, the Northspring Harpies bear exp for me (lvl 51 Hunter) and they have a somewhat good drop rate. They can be found at the Ruins of Ravenwind, in the northern most part of Feralas.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These owls now have the best droprate, at 26%.&nbsp; They are found in northern Winterspring, and directly south of Everlook near the Moon cavern.&nbsp; The northern winterspring region is perfect if you're a tribal skinner, as mobs that can be skinned for chimera and warbear leather can be found in close proximity.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Best place to farm these:<br />AV&nbsp; , lol<br /><br />as alliance farm them from the snowblind harpies -.-<br />and get some rep at the same time =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to clarify. The best place to grind these if you just want them fast and dont care about reputation, experience, other drops, or skinning is BY FAR in Thousand Needles from the Screeching Roguefeather, Screeching Harpy and Screeching Windcaller. Even though other mobs have higher droprate these mobs go down so fast and spawn so quickly that I as a lvl 60 mage only waited a little for respawn.<br />I think I only spent 2-3 hours grinding these before I could not turn anymore in to the Faire.<br /><br />If you want other things like drops, experience, leather or BG reputation while getting these, by all means get them somewhere else, but then its not REAL farming :)<br /><br />And after these I would say that Glowing Scorpid Blood should be the next thing to farm (in Silithus). I never really liked killing bats in EPL for Evil Bat Eyes, the scorpions in Silithus are alot easier to farm IMO.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the drop rate on these have been lowered for Ironbeak Screechers.&nbsp; I fought 54 of these, with only 14 dropping.&nbsp; That's a 25.9% drop rate.<br /><br />54 is kind of a small sample size, but I ran confidence intervals just in case.&nbsp; If my math is right, I'm 95% sure that the drop rate for Ironbeak Screechers is between 14.1% - 37.7%, while I'm 99% sure it's between 10.4% and 41.4%.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Harpy Cave in Thousandneedles is a good place to get vibrantplumes it took me 25 min to get 10 of them</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There's a treasure chest that spawns rather frequently while farming the harpies.&nbsp; It has mostly crap in it, but I found a silver bar as well as some other items that AH well.<br /><br />Furthermore, while I was there, I seemed to get quite a few uncommon and one rare item; leastaways much more than I usually run across.&nbsp; Perhaps it was simply making up for my abysmal luck otherwise, but it was a few things that made it even more worth it farming for the plumes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im in the thousand needles den and ive got no idea what im doing wrong.<br />Lvl 60 hunter just plain slaughtering 10 of them a at a time (using pet to grab then aoe) one out of every 15 drops 1.<br />Even if i change how i kill and kill them slower (dismiss pet and melee them 1 vs 1)<br /> the drop rate is still about 15-20= 1 vibrant plume.<br /><br />Whats going on?<br /><br />(EDIT : Was just an unlucky night. Came back 3 days later and they started dropping 1 plume to 9 kills. much better. Its still pretty slow and boring though, kick on some music and dream of the amulet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I looted 60 of these in 1 hour inside the cave in thousand needles, what I did was picking that test of endurance quest and just kept opening the boxes so waves and waves of harpies kept coming!<br /><br />60 warrior ms build. ravencrest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Can anyone confirm this? Thott has the Ironbeak Screechers of northern Felwood listed at 44%. They are low 50 however, so there is a tradeoff in how fast you can take them down at level 60.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hunt the harpies in thousand needles is without a doubt the fastest way to get these feathers, trust me! they are level 26-28 and dies in two melee hits from me with TUF, 60 warrior ms build. btw doing the bats in epl probably isnt faster bcos whilst i quested there i killed alot of em and didnt find much eyes at all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First a BIG THANKS to guys that posted the trick of the horde quest.<br /><br />If you are horde get that quest :<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1149/test-of-faith">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1149/test-of-faith</a><br /><br />Finish the 1st part, Test of Faith (very easy, just jump of the cliff) and then you will get the second part Test of Endurance.<br /><br />That quest is inside the Harpies cave and now you can klick the boxes at the end of it. When you click one of the boxes, 3 waves of harpies come. Ofcourse I NEVER went to deliver the quest.<br /><br />With my lvl 60 Mage I just stood there clicking the boxes wave after wave coming and AoE ftw.<br /><br />I was killing hundrends of those in minutes.<br /><br />Got enough Vibrant Plumes in 3-4 hours to finish up all the Plumes delivers (I started with ZERO (0) reputation with the Darkmoon Feiry),I had some Plumes sulprus too which were sold to AH for a decent price and made me a few gold.<br /><br />Also I got numerous grennies and FIVE (5) Blues of 24-26 level. Do you believe that ? FIVE Blues (of low level but those was sold for 8-10g at my server AH very easily due to chinise farmers selling similar staff from 20-30g to 60-70g, if you add the grennies and TONS of Silk Cloth I got I have made about 100g that day).<br /><br />My problem is now how do I go further than this. Tailoring/Enchanting no proffesions quests. And that bat eyes farming seems wayyyy too boring.<br /><br />EDIT: The 4 out of 5 blues I got are : (It seems I cannot find the last one in thottbot, a mace or something)<br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3208/conk-hammer">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3208/conk-hammer</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4359/handful-of-copper-bolts">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4359/handful-of-copper-bolts</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10650/plague-infested-quilboar-mane">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10650/plague-infested-quilboar-mane</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3785/keen-axe">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3785/keen-axe</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got 28 plumes while I was farming for mageweave cloth at the Ruins of Ravenwind in Feralas (killing the northspring slayers and such...)<br /><br />I spent about an hour there and managed to get 110 mageweave, 28 vibrant plumes, 24 purple lotus, green pants, and a jewelcraft design...and some various other items, but I found it was worth it. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>just sell these to the vendor, don't bother the AH</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>priapus</b></h3>You need to be level 30 (at least in classic) to see the DM Faire turn-in quest for these or else have someone over level 30 turn them in for you if you are trying to buy a storage box because it is BOE.</div>
