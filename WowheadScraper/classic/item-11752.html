You get into the Coffer room, kill everyone in the room or be sneaky(see below), read the painting, & it tells you where the guy you need to kill is which can be in 1 of 6 spawn points usually not too far away(not always though). Kill the guy that spawns, loot the bop temporary key & unlock the Vault back in the Coffer room. About half the time you'll get a Black Blood of the Tormented.\n\n[b]Stealthed ways of opening the painting:[\/b]\n\nIt's all about the mob closest to the painting. If you aggro him you aggro the whole room. If he's level 52 you can stand far enough away from him where you don't aggro him & open the painting. If you have a Rogue with imp sap, sap the guy closest to the painting. If you're able to you can kill him & Vanish. Sometimes he's 52, 53, or 54, & sometimes he's elite which makes it very hard.\n\nAbout the 6 spawn points, they are all soloable, but 2 of them are very difficult. Ofgut in the Garrison spawns near General Angerforge which makes for a 6 elite mob fight. The Grim Guzzler one that appears in the bar room is far away & pretty hard cause if you don't clear the surrounding mobs the whole room aggros. It's quicker & best to just reset instance & get a better spawn point. Those are the 2 that I'd recommend resetting. The other spawn points should be easy.\n\n[b]On the way there:[\/b]\n\nBtw as a Rogue going through the Arena is not the best way. Without opening the Shadowforge gate stealth to the bridge & jump out the window to the right when you can't go any further. Make your way passed Incendius(kill him if you can, but after 1.10 he's harder) then make your way up the Hall of Crafting, go out the door & the Coffer room is the room next to it. It's much faster & there are no dogs to worry about.\n\n[b]Rogue soloing the other 4 spawn points:[\/b]\n\n1. The spawn point inside the coffer room can be done if you position yourself in the back of the room where you open the coffer box. Then use Distract on the keyholder to seperate him from the group. He's an easy 55 Elite caster.\n\n2. The Arena spawn is easy, kill him + 2 guards(or just him & Vanish, he spawns far enough way from the spectators to not aggro others.\n\n3. The Hall of Crafting spawn is him + 2 guards again, just make sure you don't start till the fire elemental goes away(or kill it first).\n\n4. The domicile spawn is same thing, just be careful of the dog when entering.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We got the key to the dark coffer by killing all the guys on the lower level of the bar.&nbsp; Its tough there is like 25 shadow casters down there not to mention the physical attackers.&nbsp; We got whipped once and killed the rest when we respawned.&nbsp; After we killed them all one of them dropped the key and we used it on the dark coffer which contained two of the items.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is it possible to get the Blood in Raid Grp ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><i>you also have to have opened all of the other coffers first</i><br /><br />not true.&nbsp; you can view the photo to spawn the key keeper, kill him, and loot the dark coffer w/o opening any of the normal coffers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Phew! after 13 runs, finally got it. That 50% drop rate is such bull&amp;*!@.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its not that high because it drops half the time. It's that high because sometimes there is more than one Blood in the Coffer. <br /><br />Kinda dumb though if there are two people that need it, considering they are stacked in there and they are BoP. I've picked up 2 out of it in one run.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Do you need 2 keys?&nbsp; One key to get into the room, and then another one for a box in there?&nbsp; <br />this thread is kinda confusing.&nbsp; Is this right:&nbsp; You can spawn a guy outside the room that drops a key to the room, then you need another key from Guzzler to open the main coffer with the Black Blood inside?&nbsp; Let me know if this is right</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Depends on where the Dark Keeper spawns when you read the painting on whether or not you need the Shadowforge Key to get into the Dark Coffer. <br /><br />Sometimes he spawns right in the Coffer room, sometimes he spawns in the Bar. Or a few other places.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>We just did a short BRD run with 3 lvl 60 (feral druid, priest and warlock).<br />We only opened a few doors in the vault as we didn't have that many keys.<br />Then we took a look at the picture of the Key Keeper and looked him up at the Grim Guzzler (Varfolk it was).<br /><br />The Black Coffer contained all 3 items needed for the Libram quests : Black blood of the tormented, Eye of Kahjal and Burning Essence.<br /><br />Anyway, no need to open all doors in the vault to be able to open the dark coffer or get the key for the dark coffer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Get a minimum of 2 rogues and 1 druid. The rogues go solo, each in 1 instance and sneak all way to portrait and open it to make it spawn. If they succesful, all group joins them in that instance, kill the mob, give the key to one of the rogues which will sneak all way nack to coffer and open it. good luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well i didnt' know this was possible but 2 burning essences's and 2 black bloods were in the coffer when i got it today. Total sweetness! I figured at best 1 of each item migth be in it but not 2 of each.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I noticed that the librams are unigue and i was wondering if after you read one and did the enchant if you could then read another so you could put same enchant onn legs and helm.&nbsp; I would think this would work, but wondered if any one had tried this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Only one libram of each type can be carried at a time.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Libram_%28Item%29" rel="nofollow"> Wowwiki, Librams/Arcana</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This has nothing to do with the Heart of the Mountain quest where you need the Relic Coffer Keys.<br /><br />This is a bop item from the Dark Coffer room in BRD. You get into the Coffer room, kill everyone in the room or be sneaky(see below), read the painting, &amp; it tells you where the guy you need to kill is which can be in 1 of 6 spawn points usually not too far away(not always though). Kill the guy that spawns, loot the bop temporary key &amp; unlock the Vault back in the Coffer room. About half the time you'll get a Black Blood of the Tormented.<br /><br /><b>Stealthed ways of opening the painting:</b><br /><br />It's all about the mob closest to the painting. If you aggro him you aggro the whole room. If he's level 52 you can stand far enough away from him where you don't aggro him &amp; open the painting. If you have a Rogue with imp sap, sap the guy closest to the painting. If you're able to you can kill him &amp; Vanish. Sometimes he's 52, 53, or 54, &amp; sometimes he's elite which makes it very hard.<br /><br />About the 6 spawn points, they are all soloable, but 2 of them are very difficult. Ofgut in the Garrison spawns near General Angerforge which makes for a 6 elite mob fight. The Grim Guzzler one that appears in the bar room is far away &amp; pretty hard cause if you don't clear the surrounding mobs the whole room aggros. It's quicker &amp; best to just reset instance &amp; get a better spawn point. Those are the 2 that I'd recommend resetting. The other spawn points should be easy.<br /><br /><b>On the way there:</b><br /><br />Btw as a Rogue going through the Arena is not the best way. Without opening the Shadowforge gate stealth to the bridge &amp; jump out the window to the right when you can't go any further. Make your way passed Incendius(kill him if you can, but after 1.10 he's harder) then make your way up the Hall of Crafting, go out the door &amp; the Coffer room is the room next to it. It's much faster &amp; there are no dogs to worry about.<br /><br /><b>Rogue soloing the other 4 spawn points:</b><br /><br />1. The spawn point inside the coffer room can be done if you position yourself in the back of the room where you open the coffer box. Then use Distract on the keyholder to seperate him from the group. He's an easy 55 Elite caster.<br /><br />2. The Arena spawn is easy, kill him + 2 guards(or just him &amp; Vanish, he spawns far enough way from the spectators to not aggro others.<br /><br />3. The Hall of Crafting spawn is him + 2 guards again, just make sure you don't start till the fire elemental goes away(or kill it first).<br /><br />4. The domicile spawn is same thing, just be careful of the dog when entering. They are in a little hideaway room by the corner.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The reason it is a 50% drop is because the other 50% is for a mat for the libram of resilence, the burning essence. It would be nice if both dropped both times, but we are not this lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This item is used for the Libram of Rumination enchantment quest.&nbsp; It is not used for anything else.<br /><br />The <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Libram%20of%20Rumination">Libram of Rumination</a> book itself is unique.<br /><br />The <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Gizzard%20Gum">Gizzard Gum</a> which is also needed for the enchantment is also unique.<br /><br />So why does this item STACK IN LOTS OF FIVE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>do you think i can solo this part to get the black blood? I'm a 60 hunter...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For one, these things are NOT SEVENTY PERCENT DROP RATE! It took me 7 Solo BRD Coffer runs to finaly see 2 of these drop from the chest. This process takes a while to get used to, and is VERY challenging for anyone around 60-65. 65+ should have no problem with BRD at all.<br /><br />Tips:<br />- For one, do not open the lock to the door unless you have to, and the ONLY time you will have to is when the key holder is in the west garrison. (Once you open the lock with your shadowforge key, you cannot go back and forth through the big double doors)<br />- Lesser Invisibility pots are a god-send for getting past where fineous and his rock buddies are.<br />- Either be a Rogue or a Hunter, because any other class I don't think can handle this place. Perhaps a good Feral Druid, but if you are none of these, do not try this until you are at least 65 (due to vanish, stealth, and feign death advantages).<br />- Study and familiarize yourself with BRD before you start to get serious about farming for these damned things. Certain things you can only pick-up when you do this for yourself.</div>
