I did have to kill one ogre mage but all you have to do is hit them with a Fireball, pop a Fire Ward because they throw fire spells and then burn them down with whatever you normally use for single target damage.  I used half my mana and lost no hit points at all.\r\n\r\nEnter the outer section of the Dire Maul complex headed north.  Go straight up the path and then up the slightly broken ramp.  You find a wide hallway with various elite mobs and packs of non-elite wolves patrolling.  This is only the pre-dungeon portion.\r\n\r\nGo straight down the hallway, turn left (west) and there is an opening on your right that opens in to a large courtyard.  You are looking north at that point.\r\n\r\nThere are doors on the east, west and north walls of this courtyard that lead to the the 3 dungeons contained in the complex.  The west and north side each have two separate doors where you can enter those sections.\r\n\r\nThe west and north doors are locked.  To get the key to open the doors you have to go in the east dungeon, chase down the imp as detailed elsewhere and loot the crescent key from him.  He reflects spells so mages beware!  Use your wand.  You will definitely want a group for this.\r\n\r\nAfter you have the crescent key, go back to the main courtyard and make your way to the north doors.  Enter the right hand door.  There is a low wall straight ahead of you.  A little to the left is an opening with a RAMP down, not stairs as noted in other posts.  At the bottom of the ramp is a courtyard and on the left side is a group of 3-4 ogres.\r\n\r\nWatch out for patrolling wolves!\r\n\r\nTake a step or two down the left side of the ramp and jump up on the left railing.  My first jump made it look like I was standing in the middle of the railing and a second jump took me to the top of the railing.  Jump down next to the wall on your left to avoid aggro-ing the ogres.\r\n\r\nFollow the wall on your left to the first opening.  Turn left down that ramp (again, NOT stairs) and you will find yourself in a long, long hallway.  This leads to the library.  All the mobs in the library are neutral.\r\n\r\nGo through the opening in to the library and straight towards the globe\/gyroscope thingy.  Lorekeeper Lydros is looking at the bookshelves on the left wall.  Talk to him to get the quest Arcane Refreshment.\r\n\r\nI tried going back out the way I got in.  I aggro'd the mage in the group of ogres when I tried to sneak past along the wall.  If you want to do it that way, Blink up the ramp, throw a quick Frost Nova to freeze the melee mobs and run for the door out as it's just ahead and to your left when you come up the ramp.  Or just port out if you're doing this part solo.  Or else bring an invisibility potion or two.\r\n\r\nFind a group.  Go back to DM East where you found the imp.  Find Hydrospawn and kill him to get his essence.\r\n\r\nFollow the above directions to go back to DM North and turn in the essence to Lydros to complete the quest.","date":"2021-03-06T15:06:26-06:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}}];

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Go to the ogre side of DM.<br /><br />Once in, go down the ramp and take a left in the locked door.<br /><br />At the end of the hallway is a bunch of neutral chars, talk to the one with the ! above it's head.<br /><br />Go back to the imp side of DM, kill the hydro boss, and go back to the ogre side and turn in the quest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Please don't say we'll only be able to summon 2 of these at a time.&nbsp; Anyone confirm?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The quest can be gotten solo if you have the crescent key and a 2 invisibility potions. So you don't have to wait for a group of 5 to take you in or out of the ogre instance. You'll still need a group of five to help you complete the quest to kill the hydro dude.<br /><br />Wait for the dog patrols (They can smell invis) to past, then enter the main arena area and drink the potion and run to the door on the left. The potion lasts 15 seconds, which gives you plenty of time...stay left. Then leave the same way.<br /><br />Also, the hydro guy can be gotten to faster from the back of the instance from the Pavillion than from the front, but you need the crescent key.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For those of you who don't know, there are three parts of Diremaul; NORTH, WEST, and EAST.&nbsp; Each looks like an instance, but the NORTH and WEST instances need the Crescent key.<br /><br />The only thing you need to pick up this quest is to be level 60 (lvl 55's can drink the water, but you must be lvl 60 to obtain AND complete the quest) and the Crescent key which is acquired in the EAST part of Diremaul(it's a drop on an imp you have to kill, and you'll definately need a party of 5.&nbsp; After you get this key, you can enter the NORTH part of Diremaul to get to the library, where the quest giver is.&nbsp; (The library is full of neutral NPCs so you're safe there.)<br /><br />After entering the NORTH part, you will see stairs to the center-right that go downwards into a courtyard.&nbsp; Go down these stairs and take an immediate left.&nbsp; You will see a hallway going into the wall.&nbsp; Go into that long hallway, and you'll end up in the library!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I haven't seen anyone name the quest that is involved with this.<br />it is called 'Arcane Refreshment' and it is located here <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=15921">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=15921</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>What is the best way to enter the East side of DM to get the Crescent Key from the Imp?&nbsp; I see on several maps there is an entrance near the Imp that is near the &quot;pavillion.&quot; Can anyone shed more light on this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just wanted to know for sure if this could be this enchanted or not.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>U dont need any invisibility pots to get to library.<br />Just jump on left ledge then jump close to the wall&nbsp; walk round and u can sneak past the ogres into the hallway down to the door.<br />Watch out for patrol though.<br />Open door and its free run to neutral zone.<br />So dont spend money on potions.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>u dont need any crescent key to go into library.U can just die before door and res on the other side</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you cant just die at door, its an instance, you will res when you go in instance zone in</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Even if you die to get past the first locked door outside the instance, the one inside that leads to the library is also locked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>yeah lesser invisibility potion definitely helps you get past the ogre mob whilst taking the left in the courtyard... died 3 times trying to jump over unjumpable ledges.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just jumped the ledge. Def possible As it is a down hill jump at an angle - keep trying</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can acquire this quest without having the key. Die near the north entrance, run to your corpse, go through the door (as a ghost), and rez. Once inside the instance go down into the courtyard and you'll see a large door. Allign yourself with the very small gap in the left side of the door and blink. You must be precise so don't give up if you fail the first couple times.<br /><br />No invisiblity potions required.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blink trick works like a charm! Thanks!</div>
