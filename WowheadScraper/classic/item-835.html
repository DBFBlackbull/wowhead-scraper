Those nets, that were in game became BoP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9631</b></h3>That is true and the few lucky ones that still have them can really make a use of em in pvp...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8089</b></h3>These and sticky glue, and also the sleep dust were awesome for PvP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just found one of these in Westfall, I'd never heard of them.. They're quite nice! I'm surprised they aren't more popular.<br /><br />I just put this in AH on Very Long at a 10s starting bid, no buyout. In the wee hours of the morning, mind you. 2-3 hours later its up to 2g bid. This is a jackpot. In those 2-3 hours, I went back and found another 11 of these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is at 30,33 small outpost almost solely full of Trappers, quick respawns and its out of the way of the alliance so you can farm undisturbed for a long while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>One time use, still incredibly useful.<br /><br />Glad this is in alliance lands.<br /><br />I just don't have the patience to go farm these though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know if there's a place where you could buy these things, or is it just a drop?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, let's get the record straight on this one. I went up to the mentioned coordinates &amp; farmed a bit, received a few and tested.<br /><br />- It <b>IS</b> a one-time use object. Throw it and it's gone, you'll have to farm another.<br /><br />- It <b>DOES</b> have a cooldown, the duration while you cannot use <b>ANOTHER</b> net (your first one's gone, remember). <br /><br />So as a one time use, how much is this worth...?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got 2 of these while questing on a level 10 alt, and sent them to my Paladin. Since Paladins have lots of trouble catching people who are running away, these things are virtually priceless. Yes, they are a one time use. Not sure about a cooldown, though. But they have a massive range to make up for it. I'd say it's about the range of a fireball spell. Too bad there are none on the AH ever and I'll have to farm them myself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Very easy to farm these, get a mage up to lvl 25 put talent into improved arcane explosion then go kill defias trappers and murloc netters in westfall. in about an hour i got 20-30 nets.<br />Can probably get more at 4am when others dont steal ur kills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this thing really rock in pvp ... as a rogue i love them.<br /><br />to bad i'm almost out of them now ... :-(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>That spot in westfall is amazing. The trappers spawn so god damn fast. As a 60 hunter I can one shot them no problem, and I can kill 3 at once with multi shot, yet I can't go fast than the spawn rate. The only problem I have is that I kill so many and theres so much loot that I dont want filling my bags and the mobs stack up. Its hard to pick the one I just killed. So last night I hired a low level in the area to pick up all the loot for me :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Seems like the drop rate on these has been lowered.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>these nets are so cool im going 2 farm for them in westfall im lv 48 so it wont be 2 hard</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>do these stack</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>whats the range on these? it doesnt say</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yeah, crafty.. I'm 60 lvl rogue, killed about 150 of trappers.. And didnt get the net.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This net ROX. <br /><br />And 30,33 is just amazing, I kill them, they spawn, it's like blizzard wants us to farm these nets =) <br /><br />Got about 10 of them in 20-30min.<br /><br />They rox.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i came up to westfall to farm these with my orc warrior and im gonna start using them in PvP</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can get about 7 of them off trappers in about 2 or 3 hours in westfall.&nbsp; If you're waiting for your next ctf match this is something to do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Did Blizzard take away the nets after the 1.7 patch? After they made Really Stickly Glue soulbound, I have to wonder.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I farmed a few times now, and can't seem to get them anymore.&nbsp; Blizzard you idiots, these were so fun and not like they were gamebreaking or anything... free action pots, blink, etc?&nbsp; Way to go...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was told when I asked a GM, that these have been removed from the game. Sounds about right.<br /><br />Eyonix confirmed in another post 'The Large Rope Nets are now bind on pickup, and they no longer drop in darkshore and westfall'.<br /><br />Seeing as 'darkshore and westfall' were the only places with these nets, you can forget about ever seeing them again.<br /><br />Unless there's an instance filled with defias trappers I don't know about, forget about it. The large rope net is gone. The ability to net a warrior and back up is overpowered, when you consider a warrior only has 50 ways to keep you snared in melee, and 10 ways to break out of fear.<br /><br />Oh, and westfall/darkshore are alliance territory, god forbid the horde has to go to alliance territory to farm something...... Deviate fish/light feathers, anybody? Seeing as I have to go to the barrens to get those......</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Even though this very nifty rope was taken out of the game, <br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37492">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=37492</a><br /><br />Still exists and is farmable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It has been soulbound and removed from loot tables.&nbsp; Basically Blizzard killed this drop because of how it was being used.&nbsp; A mage could root a warrior with this and blast them with a couple fire spells.&nbsp; That would be GG for the warrior.<br /><br />It would soulbound to prevent people from sharing them.&nbsp; Blizzard could have easily deleted them off of everyone's characters, but that would be kinda rude :)<br /><br />Anyway, they are BoP so let's /mourn our Large Rope Nets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This was used on me 5 minutres ago, in WSG that cost me the flag...Long live the allience. &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It was not a large net rope that was atched to you it was a gnomish netomatic projecter made in engineering So HAAAAAA!</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/classic/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
