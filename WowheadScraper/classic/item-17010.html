So the only fair way to distribute the core is RR lol. yep raid roll.. \/RR \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now a random person that has no ability to Run MC regularly has a single fiery core. Person has no chance getting enough of these to actuly get an item crafted, this single core is pretty much useless to them, exept for it's high AH value. Thats how alot of fiery cores get on AH.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just about opposite situation in a organized guild raid. since it's a team work of 40 man to obtain these, how do you decide who gets them. RRing these is just madness, becasue then bunch of people that got no intent to get items crafted with them will get it, yet noone will pass becasue of the high value. And that way you get 40 people with 1 core each, that they cant do anything with, so RR is no an option realy. It gets banked, this way instead of giving out 1 peice at a time ,that way is immposible to keep track of who got what when and what are they goign to use it for, are they realy trying to get gear crafted or are they just trying to make quick buck, so you can spend your dkp on the actual item and not bits of matterials for it. \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've heard of some guild giving cores for small almounts of DKP but.. very few guilds do it, becasue it made it simple for alot of people to just go on runs to get these with dpk they got for that run and to sell them.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thats why it's not the rarety of the drop that makes these valuable, but willinnes of people to sell it, lol some people are more then willing to sell them but are never given a chance. 100g for each of these is not a bad deal at all. \n\np.s everybody who thinks that there is no need for money after you hit 60 and get you epic mount, shut up, you have no clue. chances are you will spend or will have to spend alot more money&nbsp; if your an active player then you ever had to while lvling.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The price on AH is ridiculous for one main reason. The drop is only in Molten Core. On 90% of the servers, only large guilds to MC runs, and I do not believe there will ever be a successful MC PUG. Now, if one of these drops, are you going to sell it, or are you going to keep it in your guild to make items from your guildies? Of course the miniscule quantities that filter through to AH will cost a fortune.<br /><br />Once more servers and guilds have MC on solid farm status, and there are better items out there than what Fiery Cores make, only then will the price go down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I would think guilds that have been around a long time give you fiery or lava cores for a small amount of dkp. If you ask me its a lot easier than payings hundreds of gold.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>first of... People that have never been 60, or ever been to MC please shut up, it's amuzing, yet sad to hear you talk somehtign about gold farmers and farmng fiery cores. <br /><br />Fiery cores along with lava cores only drop in MC, with means it takes an orgonized group of 40 lvl 60s to obtain them, ( for rare exeptions when some well skilled guilds farm MC for core leather and cores in as low as 25 man groups) <br /> Pick up raids get prettymuch nowhere in MC, YET sometimes when a pick up raid does get passed the first 2 lava giants, pick up group gets a fiery core.. and what they do with it? well there is no guild bank for it to go to, becasue it's the raid is pick up and consists of people from various guilds. So the only fair way to distribute the core is RR lol. yep raid roll.. /RR <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now a random person that has no ability to Run MC regularly has a single fiery core. Person has no chance getting enough of these to actuly get an item crafted, this single core is pretty much useless to them, exept for it's high AH value. Thats how alot of fiery cores get on AH.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just about opposite situation in a organized guild raid. since it's a team work of 40 man to obtain these, how do you decide who gets them. RRing these is just madness, becasue then bunch of people that got no intent to get items crafted with them will get it, yet noone will pass becasue of the high value. And that way you get 40 people with 1 core each, that they cant do anything with, so RR is no an option realy. It gets banked, this way instead of giving out 1 peice at a time ,that way is immposible to keep track of who got what when and what are they goign to use it for, are they realy trying to get gear crafted or are they just trying to make quick buck, so you can spend your dkp on the actual item and not bits of matterials for it. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've heard of some guild giving cores for small almounts of DKP but.. very few guilds do it, becasue it made it simple for alot of people to just go on runs to get these with dpk they got for that run and to sell them.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thats why it's not the rarety of the drop that makes these valuable, but willinnes of people to sell it, lol some people are more then willing to sell them but are never given a chance. 100g for each of these is not a bad deal at all. <br /><br />p.s everybody who thinks that there is no need for money after you hit 60 and get you epic mount, shut up, you have no clue. chances are you will spend or will have to spend alot more money&nbsp; if your an active player then you ever had to while lvling. MTs for MC and BWL runs, or just for very active guild have to spend 30+ gold a day in repair, and I know 30g a day isnt alot of money, but this is just onething that you actuly have to spend money on and cant get abound.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I don't like paying those prices either. But after around 120g in total repairs for multiple runs into Molten Core to get just ONE of these I understand the price. You can't go into any store and get the top of the line product for the same price as the el cheapo ones! You do get what you pay for! Just keep in mind when you think something is just WAY overpriced, exactly how much time and gold a person has invested just to MAYBE get one of these!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>For farming fiery/lava/core leather, if you have a well organized group of people, around 20 people in a few pieces of tier 1 is about the minimum you have to meet. This, of course, is impossible for the average tier 0 wearing group.<br /><br />Also, MC fire resist isn't that demanding until you meet geddon and the lava packs and the only time none melee person that need fire resist is for ragnaros.<br /><br />And yes, PUG MC is possible, Lucifron is so wimpy that as long as you have a few druid, mage, priest and paladins keep hitting the decurse/cleanse/dispel button you will be fine.</div>
