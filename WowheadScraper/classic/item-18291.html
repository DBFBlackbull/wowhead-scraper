Tips aren't bad, but not considered worth the profit for the profession.&nbsp; Both professions only sell to certain classes.&nbsp; (leather to druids and rogues, and plate to warriors and pallys)&nbsp; Some mail items from both professions for hunters, and shammys, but over all, not what ppl are really looking for, for 'top of the line gear'.&nbsp; At least with Alchemy you can makes stuff that EVERYONE uses.&nbsp; Good market!\n\nWith Engineering, ok ok ok.. we can only make stuff that 99% of the time we are the only ones that can use it..but did you ever notice how many [b]QUESTS REQUIRE ENGINEERING ITEMS?[\/b]\n\nSpeaking from the alliance side..\n\n[b]Bronze Tube[\/b]\nRogue lev 20 poison quest\nMid 20's lev quest in Duskwood\n\nsells often for 25-45 silver on AH.&nbsp; I always try to keep 5 or so on AH all the time.&nbsp; There are a few on my server (uther\/alliance) that try to sell these for 1g or more..but why?..Mine NEVER end up back in my mail, they sell every time.\n\n-------\n\n[b]Gyrochronatom[\/b]\nnutral Badlands quest from some goblin on the north side I believe requires one of these.\n\nonly takes 1 iron bar and 1 gold power core which is = to 1\/3 of a bar of gold.&nbsp; I sell very often for about 75-90s each and keep several on AH all the time.&nbsp; Rarely end up back in the mail.\n\n---------\n\n[b]8 High Explosive Bombs[\/b]\n[b]8 Unstable Triggers[\/b]\nAlong with a few other items non engineer made, are needed for a quest at Lights Hope Chapple.\n\nHaven't made these since BC since I don't really know much demand for 'old high lev areas' quest items, but mats are fairly easy to farm.&nbsp; Only Mithril, Solid Stone, and Mageweave.&nbsp; I use to sell for 5-7g for the stacks of 8.&nbsp; I'd try to keep 2 stacks of each on and I'd go about my day and one stack would sell..then a few seconds later the other stack would sell.. ppl are doing the quest :)&nbsp; (again.. haven't tried the market since BC, but I have made upon request I think 2 times now)\n\n--------\n\nThere are also quests I have yet to find or do (haven't really looked) that require [b]Advanced Target Dummy[\/b] and [b]Adamantite Frame[\/b]\n\nMaking the regular low lev [b]Target Dummy[\/b] in stacks is good money too.&nbsp; You can either loot them for [b]Fused Wiring[\/b] or they sell as is for other ppl that just want to loot them for the wires.\n\nI got the schematic for [b]Sniper Scope[\/b] for 111g (much lower now on AH..but hey..it happens) and sold the scopes for about 4-5g each and sold so many in the first few days I had my money back in less than 1 week.&nbsp; I still sell many on AH since BC since the next one up sells for around 30g.&nbsp; I sell plenty of the [b]Adamantite Scope[\/b] too which is GREAT profit!\n\n[b]My point is...[\/b]\nI didn't really research any of that info, just pay attention to what ppl are asking for and ask why they need it.. check out the mats, and keep a few on AH.&nbsp;

Altho, the 1st time i said i could craft it in /2 (Trade) i got a guy /w me and say he wanted one made. :) So its good for something. Maybe a Shammy could tell us more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7786</b></h3>Be extremely cautious about using this shield. Although the additional armor and block are nice, I've heard of incidents of the proc on this shield causing aggro to unwanted adds (scarabs, imps, etc) in raids and instances. Other than that, I've only heard good things about it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>5403</b></h3>Is there any way to get this without raiding?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This dropped off Golemagg in Molten Core last week. I'm Campbell on Horde side of Mal'Ganis.<br /><br />The proc is 30-40 damage in a 10 yard radius each block, with a 50% chance to do 1 durability damage to the shield(it has 120). It's not that bad for PvP, the armor and block is the highest of any shield in the game, and the proc $%^&amp;s kids up. Fully destroyed, takes around 240 blocks (I'm a math genius), it costs like 80s-1g to repair. It looks kind of like the Hypertech Buckler, spinning and all, except bigger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Engineering is very interesting because crafts can only be used by engineer which enable them lots of abilities : sprint, mind control, pet,bombs, reflect ice, fire and shadow and this incredible shield.<br />If you can't equip this, be sure that you will sell it at a high price...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I make huge sums of money just catering to the Gun market.&nbsp; Selling guns can be mildly profitable. But selling scopes and ammo is the best and as a lower skill lvl engineer, you can get you advanced fast because of the heavy usage of items like ammo.<br /><br />I personally feel that that being an engineer allows you to be ready for any situation and to customize your character for the enemy that you have chosen to fight at that time and if you get over your head you can summon a little help. <br /><br />Other money makers are selling grenades to vendors.&nbsp; Such as iron grenades which are mats are cheap &amp; plentiful. They are easy to make and sell for 50s a stack if I remember correctly this isnt much but if you do it alot you can make a fair some.&nbsp; Iron heavy stone and silk are usually cheap enuff to buy on the AH and make into grenades and still make a profit.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have 300 engineering on my warrior, and it is far from useless. I know only other engineers can use most of the stuff made by them, but even if the engineer doesn't make much money, many people appreciate the repair bots while doing high end instances. I also believe that when they mentioned repair KITS, they were talking about the mechanical repair kits, NOT the repair bots. There is a huge difference! Unfortunately my warrior is only level 53 so far, and can't do MC to get this awesome shield schematic.<br /><br />Oh--and about thorium widgets-- Blizzard has just recently changed the Darkmoon Faire trade skill hand ins so that ANYONE can hand in rugged armor kits and/or thorium widgets for tickets to get their epic amulet and trinket, since they don't have a hand-in available for any of the other professions. Far from useless, I believe!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think the most important aspect of the Eng class is the ability to throw grenades that stun while ur running...<br /><br />Iron Grenade<br />Thorium Grenade<br /><br />Those are the two I'm talking about...<br /><br />They dominate in pvp SOOOOO hard if you know how to use them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm a lvl 60 mage on Eredar, and the 3 second stun is an ETERNITY to anyone who is hit by it when I'm dumping damage.<br /><br />Also, it allows me to sheep casters w/o counterspell b/c the grenades have longer range than cs, so that I can use counterspell later in a fight.<br />Example: Throw nade:stun - get into range, sheep - AP/Fball/Pom+Fball/Blast/CoC - Counterspell - Finish off target w/ whatever u have left...<br />I have dropped priests, mages, and a bunch of other classes this way w/o even being touched.<br /><br />Try it, its fun!</div>

And you can really easy make thousands of these.<br />If you farm regularly thorium veins, this will get you rich already.<br /><br />The sniper-scopes are nice too, as long as you're lucky enough to find enough Starrubys.<br /><br />All kinds of rifles sell pretty well too, but the good ones cost a lot of mats too.<br /><br />I'm sure you can find people who buy EZ Throw Dynamite II as well for it's very nice for PvP if you're not an engineer.<br /><br />And the ressi/reflection trinkets (at least the fire and shadow ones) kick ass too and the recepies are rare enough to find buyers that are engineers but don't have the recepie.<br /><br />And engineering is anyways the best professions for you're getting a second hearthstone to eigher Gadgetzan (gnome) or Everlook (goblin).<br />And there are really a lot of very useful items, especially for PvP that you can only use, if you're an engineer.<br /><br />But anyways, it's actually the topic of this shield above. And this shield os one of the reasons why I'm an engineer. It's sure damn good to keep aggro. But you gotta be rich to repair it all the time and on long instances you'll probably need at least once a repbot (but hey, aren't you an engineer anyways?).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>lol that poster didn't mean that engies create another hartstone. As an engineer you can build one of two dimensional rippers, one to gadgetzan and one to everlook in winterspring. it has a 4 hr cooldown but its still really handy if you need to get out of a difficult spot or just need to get to somewhere close to either of those places.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i make loads of money selling bullets(thorium bullets sell for 1.5g a stack!) and engineering gives you an endless supply of amazing trinkets. seriously, engineering is not about the cash though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Having off tanks with this shield is pretty much the only way to kill Fankriss in AQ 40.&nbsp; The warrior does 1 shout at the start, and all the bugs start pounding on him instead of your healers.&nbsp; The AOE draws the additional adds that come.&nbsp; The more bugs=more procs= more aggro.&nbsp; Other items that cause damage on receiving damage are helpful for this fight too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok.. listen for all the newbs out there who think this profession doesn't make money.<br /><br />If you have LW or BS you really only make money with the higher end stuff and that is only IF the person doesn't have mats.&nbsp; Tips aren't bad, but not considered worth the profit for the profession.&nbsp; Both professions only sell to certain classes.&nbsp; (leather to druids and rogues, and plate to warriors and pallys)&nbsp; Some mail items from both professions for hunters, and shammys, but over all, not what ppl are really looking for, for 'top of the line gear'.&nbsp; At least with Alchemy you can makes stuff that EVERYONE uses.&nbsp; Good market!<br /><br />With Engineering, ok ok ok.. we can only make stuff that 99% of the time we are the only ones that can use it..but did you ever notice how many <b>QUESTS REQUIRE ENGINEERING ITEMS?</b><br /><br />Speaking from the alliance side..<br /><br /><b>Bronze Tube</b><br />Rogue lev 20 poison quest<br />Mid 20's lev quest in Duskwood<br /><br />sells often for 25-45 silver on AH.&nbsp; I always try to keep 5 or so on AH all the time.&nbsp; There are a few on my server (uther/alliance) that try to sell these for 1g or more..but why?..Mine NEVER end up back in my mail, they sell every time.<br /><br />-------<br /><br /><b>Gyrochronatom</b><br />nutral Badlands quest from some goblin on the north side I believe requires one of these.<br /><br />only takes 1 iron bar and 1 gold power core which is = to 1/3 of a bar of gold.&nbsp; I sell very often for about 75-90s each and keep several on AH all the time.&nbsp; Rarely end up back in the mail.<br /><br />---------<br /><br /><b>8 High Explosive Bombs</b><br /><b>8 Unstable Triggers</b><br />Along with a few other items non engineer made, are needed for a quest at Lights Hope Chapple.<br /><br />Haven't made these since BC since I don't really know much demand for 'old high lev areas' quest items, but mats are fairly easy to farm.&nbsp; Only Mithril, Solid Stone, and Mageweave.&nbsp; I use to sell for 5-7g for the stacks of 8.&nbsp; I'd try to keep 2 stacks of each on and I'd go about my day and one stack would sell..then a few seconds later the other stack would sell.. ppl are doing the quest :)&nbsp; (again.. haven't tried the market since BC, but I have made upon request I think 2 times now)<br /><br />--------<br /><br />There are also quests I have yet to find or do (haven't really looked) that require <b>Advanced Target Dummy</b> and <b>Adamantite Frame</b><br /><br />Making the regular low lev <b>Target Dummy</b> in stacks is good money too.&nbsp; You can either loot them for <b>Fused Wiring</b> or they sell as is for other ppl that just want to loot them for the wires.<br /><br />I got the schematic for <b>Sniper Scope</b> for 111g (much lower now on AH..but hey..it happens) and sold the scopes for about 4-5g each and sold so many in the first few days I had my money back in less than 1 week.&nbsp; I still sell many on AH since BC since the next one up sells for around 30g.&nbsp; I sell plenty of the <b>Adamantite Scope</b> too which is GREAT profit!<br /><br /><b>My point is...</b><br />I didn't really research any of that info, just pay attention to what ppl are asking for and ask why they need it.. check out the mats, and keep a few on AH.&nbsp; I think this profession ROCKS cuz it targets <b>ALL CLASSES and MANY LEVELS</b>&nbsp; Large market!<br /><br />For all you on UTHER /Alliance... MZ NASTY FTW!<br /><br />I apologize, for this post really had nothing to do with the shield, I just hate Engineer bashing.</div>
