Well you're probably not running an enhancement sham anyways, or you do for the meme and to flex on other guild, or you think you need this buff, so you might as well ask one of your sham to go for it.\r\nHere is the thing : shaman only do auto-attack. Yes, no GCD is being used for extra attack, and no, the 31 talent on enhancement tree is a no go. It take a precious slot on the debuff list of the boss (remember you're going for max efficiency), and it has a 20 sec cooldown.\r\n\r\nNow let's imagine a perfect situation, the shaman manage to keep his flurry (30% attack speed) up all the time.\r\nthe 3.5 AS become 2.45, this make a total of 25 attack in 1 min.\r\nWF has 20% chance to proc (so basically 1\/5). Pretty convenient, 1\/5 of 25 is 5. \r\n5 WF in 1min of battle, that makes 10 extra attack (since shaman get 2 extra attack from WF instead of one from the totem)\r\nSo a total of 35 hit in 1 min (remember, perfect situation, no dodge and stuff).\r\nNow if you read all the other comment on people who have tested the thing, you'll see that the NF proc has a good 10% chance to proc.\r\nThat makes 3.5 proc in 1 min, for a total of 17.5 sec uptime. It's not even a third, pretty bad\r\n\r\nNow let's imagine you give that to a warrior\r\nWarrior also have flurry, so also 25 hit in 1 min. 20% WF, so also 5 proc, but it's only 1 extra attack so it goes for 30. That's only 3 proc, not that great. But here's the thing, warrior can use a gcd, one that doesn't use a debuff slot on the boss : hamstring.\r\nYou know what's great with hamstring ? It also proc WF !\r\nGCD is 1.5, that makes an extra 40 hit in 1 min, and 8 WF proc, for a total of 78 hit in 1 min.\r\nWith a 10% proc on NF, that make a total of 7.8 proc per minute, 39 sec of uptime on the boss, almost 2\/3. It's just crazy good !\r\n\r\nBu...bu...bu...but ! Warrior are the best dps ! This is such a waste !\r\nWell sorry but you were the one ready to sacrifice the dps of one player for the benefit of all the caster, also, you might have a hard time finding enough weapon to equip all your warrior, so this is a good solution to boost your raid dps.\r\nBut you know what ? I understand you, I'm with you in this, dere warrior (keep those sunder and shouting up thx). So here's the perfect solution:\r\n\r\nYou want a class that can put the debuff efficiently, without taking another debuff slot, one whose dps isn't great and you can sacrifice, here it is:\r\nHUNTER !\r\nYes, hunter, the more you'll advance in the content, the worst they'll be, (and they never get better than a good enhancement sham) so you might has well use them for what they are best : putting the NF debuff. They generally are in the melee group for their AP aura, so they will benefit from the WF too, and they will spam rank 1 wing clip, it works exactly like hamstring, but unlike warrior they won't get out of rage, so they can spam it (its only 40 mana) till the boss is dead.\r\nGive that to an orc (Axe Specialization), the guy probably picked that race for pvp, so he doesn't care for its damage in raid (if he did, he would have picked a troll) ; if he do, well he can always go for a beast master build, fighting along side his furry friend and using at best his orc racial (pet damage bonus).\r\nHunters always want to get those nice melee weapon, give them this one, you'll please everyone (except them but eh, who care ?)\r\n\r\nFor the math : hunter don't have a melee AS bonus, so the auto attack will be worse than the warrior (who remains the best choice for NF debuff) with a 17 attack per minute, that's 3 extra attack from WF, so a total of 20 hit, but it goes up to 68 with the wingclip spam, for a nice 6.8 proc per min, wich make a 34 sec uptime. That's a half time, not bad (and still better than sham).\r\n\r\nSo thats it, if you're willing to nerf the dps of one guy, you now have the tools to make the right choice, yeah you can put that on the meme sham, you're sure that he will never threaten the other melee class (like \" dude, you're behind the meme sham, what's your excuse ?\"), and the caster will not see much of a difference. Or you can give that to a real debuff bringer, or someone that doesn't do better than enhancement sham anyway, and will do a better job at boosting the raid.","date":"2020-04-21T06:16:20-05:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"\"You know what's great with hamstring ?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Marinus</b></h3>Having mixed feelings about this weapon. It is a raid weapon solely (although useful on AV generals and such) which makes it quite expensive for the use you're going to get out of it. Has about a 2 PPM rate, meaning it will be up on target avg 17% of the time. Flurry specc'd warrior will probably see 20% of the time. Damage output is really low however. I've dropped from top 5 DPS meters (fury warrior) to right around 20 using this.<br /><br />And don't even bother with this in 20 mans. Stuff dies too quick to be of any use. Might get one proc every few mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1144</b></h3>I'm an Off-tank prot warrior for my guild. I have found in Naxx that there are some encounters where I'm usually for the most part dead weight. I got this crafted and now use it on Maexna, Thaddius, Hiegan, and probably Loatheb when we get there. <br /><br />The weapon is incredible, it procs all the time. On the Thaddius fight it multiplicatively augments the damage buff so its 15% applied to the total damage already bumped 190%, which turns out to be about 2000dmg on just the Ignites ticking on him in addition to all the other incoming spell damage. The weapon is worth every copper you'd spend on the mats, and it allows an otherwise useless prot warrior to add more than just thunderclap and demo to a one tank fight!<br /><br />Highly recommend for any guild pushing Naxx.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Falcore</b></h3>For those struggling to get the last couple percent on Bosses such as Patchwerk and Loatheb these could do it for you. Though this all depends on your raid's build, how many caster classes you are taking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8558</b></h3>A very good axe to help overall raid damage per second. The character wielding this crafted weapon will still produce moderate amount of dps while helping the rest of the raid when the axe procs. <br /><br />When the axe procs, the target mob will display a debuff and thus will increase raid dps allowing casters to produce more spell damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>9296</b></h3>Very good for Shamans, could possibly have its place in a raid to increase ranged DPS, although I wouldn't personally think about getting one unless I was using it for a raid because A)The mats are VERY expensive and B)It is not nearly as usefull when you are alone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tankfist</b></h3>I got one of these crafted for me, and as a palladin ive found it extremely usefull. I have found that with the new talents and a holy build although this is primarily used by me in BWL and MC this weapon proc makes me absolutely deadly i have had some massive burst dps come from this beauty.<br /><br />This should only be crafted for people who are attending the majority of raids or who can get the mats from the guild.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is obviously a weapon a GUILD is supposed to use. The materials that go into making this weapon are very very very rarely for sale - this is stuff huge guilds pool together to make stuff that will benefit people in their huge guild - or rather, stuff that will make their huge guild stronger.<br /><br />This is an axe for the raid's two-handed DPS Warrior to use to increase the damage done by the Guild's Warlocks and Mages. Naturally, a Shaman and a Paladin could also use it, if they want to risk being on the front lines.<br /><br />Yeah - it takes up a debuff slot. Name a debuff you'd PREFER in that slot. <br /><br />Seriously - name that Debuff. What? Deep Wounds? Shadow Word: Pain? What Debuffs are so precious, that in the existing 8 (and the upcoming 16) slots, there's no room for this?<br /><br />Warlock -Resistance curses are just about the MAIN debuffs in these fights (they up the damage of EVERYONE) - and this should go in on top of it. Whoever is swinging this weapon makes everyone in the team stronger.</div>

Give this weapon to a shaman; no other class has a higher chance to proc this weapon than a shaman.<br /><br />I'm an enhancement shaman, and in MC I already spend a lot of time swinging at mobs for DPS.&nbsp; I've never had survivability issues, cuz I'm certainly more survivable than a rogue and they're frontline all the time!&nbsp; Boss fights I'm usually healing, but if I had this weapon I'm sure that'd change.&nbsp; The reasoning is that a shaman with Flurry and a good crit build not only does damage comparable to that of dps wars and rogues (not quite, yes, I know), but would also have ~50% higher chance to paste the proc effect on the enemy.&nbsp; This is something that only a shaman can do.<br /><br />Problem still remains, though, you gotta find a shaman worth his salt!&nbsp; ;P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since I got this nice axe I did some research on how beneficial this thing is. <br /><br />Since blizzard made meny weapon procs on per/minute basis I decided to test if increasing attack speed is in anyway beneficial to get more procs. <br /><br />Here are the results with regular attacks, at the weapon speed that is 3.5 <br /><br /><a href="http://magewave.com/community/index.php?act=Attach&amp;type;=post&amp;id;=8" rel="nofollow">http://magewave.com/community/index.php?act=Attach&amp;type;=post&amp;id;=8 </a><br /><br />On the other hand I used Seal of Crusader this seal gives 40% attack speed increase. Here we go <br /><br /><a href="http://magewave.com/community/index.php?act=Attach&amp;type;=post&amp;id;=7" rel="nofollow">http://magewave.com/community/index.php?act=Attach&amp;type;=post&amp;id;=7 </a><br /><br />The difference is obvious, SoC is gives about 40% more procs. <br /><br />Now raid benefit. Based on the stats above while using SoC during 28.5mins I got 611 hits and 113 procs. <br />611/113=18.4% proc rate <br />Proc duration is 5sec, so 113*5=565sec Time debuff is on. <br />If fight is 28.4 mins and proc is on for 9.4 mins iit's 30%. <br />All casters get 15% DPS boost for 30% of the time. <br /><br />If we take a cast of 2.5sec then 565/2.5=226 casts can land in 28.4mins with this buff on. If frost bolt deals 800dmg then 226*15%of800=27120 more DPS in 28.4 mins from one mage. <br />But we all know that it looks nice here but in reality we will not be able to cast 100% of the time when the proc is on, not even 70% but we might hit around 50% or 40% of the procs, still 10,000 more DPS from single caster in 30mins is great. <br /><br />I think this weapon is more beneficial for paladins because of SoC and statistic I got, but I might be wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; I want to make it clear that Seal of Crusader DOES cause more procs for this weapon. If you want to question this then take a paladin take a pen and paper or a mod and test it. I presented this weapon with real numbers and hours of testing at over six months a go right after this weapon was changed to give 15% spell dmg increase and speed was reduced to 3.5 from 3.8<br /><br /> My post is here <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/ccb=1&amp;v;=767354">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/ccb=1&amp;v;=767354</a> on this very page. Images of my research are not available since i moved to another hosting company.<br /><br /> Basic idea is that normal attack speed caused 12%-15% of hits to proc during 30min time frame while SoC caused&nbsp; 17%-22% with average of 18.4% proc rate.<br /><br /> According to my statistics SoC increases number of procs by 40%. i am not here to argue I am here to show facts. I am using this weapon as my primary one for over six months being a paladin and i know&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where it can go. you can do similar tests on other weapon procs and they also tend to be affected by SoC.<br /><br /> Procs are not simply based on numbers per minute they are based on the weapon speed. if the weapon speed is x then it procs number y times per z swings with deviation, based on this speed. SoC does not increase weapon speed it increases attack speed so if x stays the same but z goes up the y will increase as well causing more procs.<br /><br /> Everything is based on facts.<br /><br />Judgments do not cause weapon procs since they do not involve the weapon itself.<br /><br />Nightfall is a great paladin weapon for one great reason it benefits the paladin. think about it what will warrior do with 15% spell dmg outside of raiding? Nothing. This weapon allows for burst DPS in pvp, and it is useful for grinding. I see this weapon beneficial for shaman or paladin but i am not sure how warrior would be a great choice from this point of view.<br /><br />This weapon is great i love it and I am happy that I got it I owe it all to &quot;Vox Noctis&quot; .<br /><br />It scales with level and has good future in TBC.</div>

Can somebody explain how?<br /><br />Nightfall: 67.0 DPS<br />Arc Reaper: 58.2 DPS (<i>including</i> the +62 Attack Power bonus)<br /><br />Nightfall is better by 8.8 DPS. That's equivalent to 123 Attack Power, or nearly 62 points of Strength.<br /><br />And yes, the Reaper has a STA boost, but Nightfall has the spell dmg proc (great for Shamans... to COMBINE with Stormstrike, muwahahaha!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Okay do you see it saying &quot;Class: Shaman&quot; The answer is no. Yes a shaman could use it, but it is actualy more useful for a warrior, and check this out. It procs alot, but the effect only lasts for 5 seconds, so when a shaman see's the proc they will probably be able to get one spell off. Where as if a warrior had it, it will proc multiple times through the fight, and there is a VERY good chance that multiple spells will hit the mob when it does. Now, do you want one shaman to get one spell off from it, or have 6-10 spells go while the proc it up, thus putting out tons of damage in 5 seconds.<br /><br />And if there is a post after this one still saying it's for shamans, then be quiet, the adults are talking :)</div>

Basically a healer who still can melee a little?<br /><br /><a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-50230001-350053513503151">Talents here</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Drosera</b></h3>501 white swings, 52 procs tested. <br /><br />Roughly 10% proc rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FilthyFrog</b></h3>I did some tests on 53 lvl dummy in Blasted Lands: 1070 hits, 1046 lands (34 misses), 126 buffs. 126/1046 around 12% chance on hit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KatzenShaft</b></h3>Limited testing with a ret paladin:Auto attack - ~15% debuff uptime, With Seal of Righteousness - ~15% debuff uptime, Seal of Command - ~15% debuff uptime, Seal of the Crusader: ~8% uptime.<br /><br />Seems like increased weapon speed will reduce proc chance. Doesn't seem like SoR, or Soc will increase proc rate, judgement of command may proc nightfall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fourchaise</b></h3>Wanted to determine as a paladin what seal made any difference so i programmed a simple weakaura to count both successful hits on target as well as nightfall procs. Thoroughly tested this weakaura to make sure it counted when procs overlapped each other and not count dodge/parry/misses.<br /><br />Tested on classic version 1.13.4<br /><br />Went to winterspring in a zone with chillwinds and bears lvls 55~57 to be able to chain them with minimal fight downtime <i>(to reduce possible interference of per-minute proc limitations). </i><br />Myself a lvl60 paladin. Nightfall with a counterweight, I had base atck speed of 3.4<br /><br />Results are as follows with only Bok as personal buff:<br /><br /><b>SoR</b><br />200 hits -&gt; 47 procs<br /><br /><b>SotC</b><br />280 hits -&gt; 21 procs<br />(amount of hits in the same span of fight time with the added atck speed) <br /><br /><b>SoC</b><br />200 hits -&gt; 25 procs<br /><br />To me it seems obvious that the SoR damage can proc the weapon on-hit property<br /><br />Additionnally it seems SoC damage can also proc it....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kantyk</b></h3>Alright, I'm gonna break it down,because it's just sad to see all those shaman with this stupid weapon on them :<br /><br />NO, this is NOT a BiS weapon for enhancement sham, not for him, not for your raid, if you want the debuff on the boss, shaman is the worst choice you can make and here's the explanation.<br /><br />You're either a raid with minmaxing need/desire (and you want this debuff), or one that doesn't care, because classic isn't much of a challenge nowadays. <br />If you're in the second position, then you don't need that debuff to the point where you're gonna bully your enhancement sham to carry this garbage when he could look all mighty and glorious with Sulfuras (and if you gave that thing to a warrior instead of a shaman, you need to delete this game from your computer, trust me, it's for the greater good).<br /><br />Now if you're in the first position, you might be in competition with other guild, and you're aiming for maximum efficiency. Well you're probably not running an enhancement sham anyways, or you do for the meme and to flex on other guild, or you think you need this buff, so you might as well ask one of your sham to go for it.<br />Here is the thing : shaman only do auto-attack. Yes, no GCD is being used for extra attack, and no, the 31 talent on enhancement tree is a no go. It take a precious slot on the debuff list of the boss (remember you're going for max efficiency), and it has a 20 sec cooldown.<br /><br />Now let's imagine a perfect situation, the shaman manage to keep his flurry (30% attack speed) up all the time.<br />the 3.5 AS become 2.45, this make a total of 25 attack in 1 min.<br />WF has 20% chance to proc (so basically 1/5). Pretty convenient, 1/5 of 25 is 5. <br />5 WF in 1min of battle, that makes 10 extra attack (since shaman get 2 extra attack from WF instead of one from the totem)<br />So a total of 35 hit in 1 min (remember, perfect situation, no dodge and stuff).<br />Now if you read all the other comment on people who have tested the thing, you'll see that the NF proc has a good 10% chance to proc.<br />That makes 3.5 proc in 1 min, for a total of 17.5 sec uptime. It's not even a third, pretty bad<br /><br />Now let's imagine you give that to a warrior<br />Warrior also have flurry, so also 25 hit in 1 min. 20% WF, so also 5 proc, but it's only 1 extra attack so it goes for 30. That's only 3 proc, not that great. But here's the thing, warrior can use a gcd, one that doesn't use a debuff slot on the boss : hamstring.<br />You know what's great with hamstring ? It also proc WF !<br />GCD is 1.5, that makes an extra 40 hit in 1 min, and 8 WF proc, for a total of 78 hit in 1 min.<br />With a 10% proc on NF, that make a total of 7.8 proc per minute, 39 sec of uptime on the boss, almost 2/3. It's just crazy good !<br /><br />Bu...bu...bu...but ! Warrior are the best dps ! This is such a waste !<br />Well sorry but you were the one ready to sacrifice the dps of one player for the benefit of all the caster, also, you might have a hard time finding enough weapon to equip all your warrior, so this is a good solution to boost your raid dps.<br />But you know what ? I understand you, I'm with you in this, dere warrior (keep those sunder and shouting up thx). So here's the perfect solution:<br /><br />You want a class that can put the debuff efficiently, without taking another debuff slot, one whose dps isn't great and you can sacrifice, here it is:<br />HUNTER !<br />Yes, hunter, the more you'll advance in the content, the worst they'll be, (and they never get better than a good enhancement sham) so you might has well use them for what they are best : putting the NF debuff. They generally are in the melee group for their AP aura, so they will benefit from the WF too, and they will spam rank 1 wing clip, it works exactly like hamstring, but unlike warrior they won't get out of rage, so they can spam it (its only 40 mana) till the boss is dead.<br />Give that to an orc (Axe Specialization), the guy probably picked that race for pvp, so he doesn't care for its damage in raid (if he did, he would have picked a troll) ; if he do, well he can always go for a beast master build, fighting along side his furry friend and using at best his orc racial (pet damage bonus).<br />Hunters always want to get those nice melee weapon, give them this one, you'll please everyone (except them but eh, who care ?)<br /><br />For the math : hunter don't have a melee AS bonus, so the auto attack will be worse than the warrior (who remains the best choice for NF debuff) with a 17 attack per minute, that's 3 extra attack from WF, so a total of 20 hit, but it goes up to 68 with the wingclip spam, for a nice 6.8 proc per min, wich make a 34 sec uptime. That's a half time, not bad (and still better than sham).<br /><br />So thats it, if you're willing to nerf the dps of one guy, you now have the tools to make the right choice, yeah you can put that on the meme sham, you're sure that he will never threaten the other melee class (like &quot; dude, you're behind the meme sham, what's your excuse ?&quot;), and the caster will not see much of a difference. Or you can give that to a real debuff bringer, or someone that doesn't do better than enhancement sham anyway, and will do a better job at boosting the raid.</div>
