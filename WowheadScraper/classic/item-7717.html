This happens more than you'd think and it's extremely annoying. I've had a mob at low HP and procced both WF and bladespin and WF definitely does not do any damage. Here is proof: [url=http:\/\/img152.imageshack.us\/img152\/2064\/ravagerne9.gif]http:\/\/img152.imageshack.us\/img152\/2064\/ravagerne9.gif[\/url] - you can clearly see windfury had no effect whatsoever.\n\nHOWEVER, if the very last hit of the bladespin procs a windfury, that [b]will[\/b] do damage (as long as one of those windfury hits doesn't proc another bladespin! I've had that happen). I think this is where people are getting confused with WF working \/ not working.\n\nRemember, every hit of your windfury has a chance of proccing the bladespin, which means there is about a 45% chance that every one of your WF procs with this weapon will do nothing.\n\n[b]Third[\/b]: Flurry has no effect on the bladespin, so any charges of flurry you have going into the bladestorm go to waste.\n\n[b]Fourth[\/b]: Proc rate seems about 15% or so. Not reliable enough to decide to suddenly start AOEing monsters; but if you are already hunting monsters in packs anyway then it wouldn't hurt.\n\n[b]Fifth[\/b]: casting anything will disrupt the bladespin. This is both good and bad. Good because you can cancel it if you want, but bad because casting any Shock spells for extra damage on a target will cancel the bladespin.\n\nI can say with complete confidence that this weapon will lead to a LOSS in true dps - for a Shaman, anyway - compared to another weapon with similar dps stated on the item, when dealing with single targets. Since Shamans don't get any good AoE's anyway, besides some very mana expensive totems, you are not going to run into many situations where you would want to use this weapon. One exception I can think of would be in an instance where you aren't healing. In PvP this definitely isn't worth it since you are always using your Shock spells, which would interrupt this weapon's proc.\n\nSo, in conclusion: Shamans, the only two reasons you would use this weapon is if it's over 10 dps higher than anything else you can find, or if you are fighting (not healing) in an instance with a group. That's it. Hoped this helped some of you guys who were wondering how the Ravager's proc worked in detail.\n\nI've gone back to using my Corpsemaker, even though the DPS is 5 less (on the character screen,&nbsp; not the weapon itself) than the Ravager.","date":"2006-10-07T08:37:19-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"WF absolutely DOES proc while the weapon proc is active.&nbsp; Since the weapon hits once every 3 seconds while spinning, you would normally only see 3 hit numbers over 9 secs.&nbsp; However, when WF procs, your screen fills up with the WF hits AS WELL AS THE WEAPON PROC HIT.&nbsp; In fact, I've had WF proc multiple times in combination with the weapon proc.&nbsp; It seems to have a continuous effect when this happens and I spin out like a mo-fo for 27-36 secs when multiple mobs are present.&nbsp; The proc can get annoying sometimes, but is easily broken by casting a heal\/spell (shammys and pa","creationdate":"2006-10-07T08:37:19-05:00","id":1154493,"rating":6,"commentid":2630678,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Thottbot","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Lorcon","importedSubject":"WF DOES proc with the weapon proc"}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"VaIeo","importedSubject":"Very bad weapon for a Shaman."},{"commentv2":1,"number":25,"id":2630703,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Once again, hello all,\n\nIm now 40, and love my SM gear.

Enhancement [class=7] takes the third place in priority, as a [class=1] has their [item=6975] from Class Q., which proves to be better for overall DPS as a [class=1], both for leveling and dungeons.[\/i]\n\ud83d\udd0d [i]An upgrade for all of the above mentioned classes is the [item=6830], which is an even better weapon suited for DDs, with the exception of Survival [class=3], who can, if they so desire, use this weapon up to LVL 60 and even in raids. The AoE is stronger and more consistent than [spell=14288], which has a 10 SEC. CD and preparation to cast.

If it didn't proc we'd have to kill them slowly with things like magma totem and normal attacks, but if it procs it not only holds threat on everything immediately, but everything dies extremely quickly. It was even strong all the way through level 55, pulling 8 enemies in Un'goro Crater to aoe them all down was very efficient.\r\n\r\nSome more details on things I noticed:  It can proc windfury weapon, but the extra hits won't happen whilst you're spinning, you seemingly get a invisible buff that gives you a windfury attack on your next normal attack within 3 or so seconds, so if you're spinning and you see a winfury proc animation (whirl of wind around you), then you can cancel the spin and get a guaranteed windfury on your next hit. sometimes the last tick of the aoe can proc windfury, which will immediately attack with that windfury doing a huge amount of burst, and those windfury hits can proc the axe again for you.\r\n\r\nWhen you finish spinning, sometimes the last hit will proc another spin, but the damage from the second spin will be applied immediately, if this happens it'll take 6 seconds before you actually do damage again with the spin, this is because your 3 hits over the 9 or so seconds are always limited to 3 hits, and getting 1 hit immediately doesn't change the time that the next 2 hits take place. So it's often better to just cancel the spin if this happens as 6 seconds of no damage can be a long time, especially if things are going to be dead before that.\r\n\r\nFrostbrand applies it's slow to all enemies it hits whilst spinning, which can be great to stop fleeing enemies during big pulls.\r\n\r\nFlametongue does about the same amount of damage as rockbiter but without the threat generation, making it the ideal weapon enhancement for dungeons if you're going to use this weapon.\r\n\r\nUsing any abilities, or simply cancelling the spinning buff with stop the spin, this is extremely useful when you need to chase someone or run away.\r\n\r\nIt CAN proc off of itself, leading to very long periods of spinning nonstop, sometimes it'll proc in the middle of the channel, sometimes right at the end as mentioned prior.\r\n\r\nIf you get disarmed whilst spinning you'll keep spinning but with your unarmed skill taking over and doing damage, as such it's a good idea to keep your unarmed skill up to get a little bit more damage in those cases, or use a steel weapon chain to prevent yourself from getting disarmed!\r\n\r\nWhilst spinning you can't be knocked back, this is extremely useful in certain niche situations, for example some mobs like [npc=9376] will continuously knock you back whilst fighting them, but if you start spinning you will be rooted in place.\r\n\r\nBecause the axe can only proc on melee attacks, be sure to use any abilities in-between attacks rather than on them if you don't want to accidentally cancel the spin if it were to proc.\r\n\r\nThe attacks can miss, parry, block, dodge and crit.\r\n\r\nTrinkets and affects that can proc from attacks like Dragonbreath Chilli & [item=19289] can proc during the spin, making them quite valuable.\r\n\r\nWhilst you're spinning you're very vulnerable, and you'll be generating a lot of threat from the aoe damage (especially so if in Defensive stance, using Righteous Fury with Seal of Righteousness, or using Rockbiter Weapon), so be sure to wear heavier armour than you may otherwise like so healers don't hate you, elixirs of armour can also help greatly.\r\n\r\nMobs with ranged attacks will attempt to run out of your melee attack range whilst you're spinning (as they consider you rooted), but the axe will still hit them due to it having an extended attack range, as a shaman against shooting enemies Windwall totem is your best friend for this, combined with stoneskin you can massively reduce damage taken whilst spinning and not spinning allowing you to safely pull multiple mobs.\r\n\r\nThis last one may be a bug, but I've experienced it many times, sometimes your auto attack with proc the spin, the but spin will immediately be cancelled, I'm not sure what causes this.","date":"2021-05-03T18:44:40-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":145,"id":5861538,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"MW15","body":"Having this axe is how it feels to be a gigachad","date":"2024-05-21T16:12:33-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":4,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":146,"id":5900172,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"123user","body":"I'm surprised there's not much reliable data on the proc rate of this thing.

Shackle, polymorph, sap, anything. As a mage, I want to kill the warrior using this thing that constantly breaks the polymorph but then refuses to move away from the sheeped mob.<br /><br />2) Don't use this thing unless you have a really good tank or a lot of armor. If you are using this weapon then you are not using a shield and you will very quickly get a lot of aggro and mobs pounding on you. I just ran ZF with a paladin who used this and I wanted to kill her because when the thing proc'd then she couldn't heal herself and when everything started pounding on her and her life dropped like a rock I had to burn all my mana keeping her alive.<br /><br />Truly, please don't use this in instances. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>6984</b></h3>I agree. Many warriors suddenly proc, twirling around in the middle of a Battleground. Then we just laugh and kill him in no time, and he can't do anything. Don't use this in BG much either, it could prove disastrous, especially if you're chasing a flag carrier in WSG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8271</b></h3>Well on my pally its really easy to get it off. Just use any seal or judgement and it instantly takes it off. For wars, i have no idea.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8976</b></h3>The axe is good for warrios,paladins. It has no stats so it's really bad for a hunter. The proc is very annoyin, you will have to use a spell/abillity to stop it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8455</b></h3>The axe is good for pve, but i wouldnt recomend it for pvp. Because if the axe procs on a hunter or mage or any ranged dps class they can easily get out of the axes reach , and just put an aimshot or pyroblast on you and work you down while you are helplessly spinning. Its a good axe just use caution!</div>

There are instances later in the game with weak non elite mobs zerging you, and this really does come in handy when it procs.<br /><br />Examples of instances: Zul Farrak. Blackrock Depths. Stratholme. Atleast those I remember.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>h4rr0d</b></h3>i just started using this beauty as retri specced pala. i hoped that the proc will have ability to trigger seal of command, that proved to be untrue sadly. anyway its still very good axe to be used with SoC due to slow attack speed (and big damage). <br />and about the proc, the range of whirlwind is rly huge (i'd say like 8yds - thats hunter's dead zone for instance). oh and it can be broked by any spellcast, including those with cast time, like heals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>loozerr</b></h3>This weapon looks cool, so does the proc, it hits well but it made lot of trouble in SM Cath run when one warr was wearing it. He pulled many mobs in cath because of it, he removed several polymorphs, once we almost got wiped. But weapon is brilliant for lvl 37.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>36466</b></h3>i can see how this axe is a solution and problem for tanking warriors and/or pallys. the way i see it is that when tanking when a guy runs and you are busy beating the crap out of another guy, you dont have time to chase him down. and warriors dont have an AoE. so this axe would will allow you to kill like 3 guys at the same time and still be able to guard people so they dont die. now for the disadvantage. its the fact that it is an AoE. if you start the spell you are stuck with it and cant cancel it for a warrior. so be careful, if you are running a very compact and small dungeon, for goodness sake dont use this without a hunter and preist.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zeshar</b></h3>I thought I would chime in and mention that the &quot;Bladestorm&quot; effect of this will proc the shaman ability Frostbrand, but not Flametongue or Windfury.</div>

Tha being said however...it is an awesome toy and should work well ...toe to toe...with mobs in the open. I got this running &quot;In the Name of the Light&quot; so I still took the Bonebiter two-handed Axe for a Quest reward. It being the superior of the two.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>--------<br />Quote:<br /><br />&quot;This axe only looks good, nothing else. <br />It has like the worst proc in the game: when it procs you can't do anything for 5 secs you can just stand still and spin around, If that happens when your enemy is running away or you're just about to heal you can head into serious trouble. <br />I got this axe but decided to use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7180">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7180</a> instead because Ravager only adds one(1) more DPS to my overall dps compared to that one. <br />I Disenchanted it and only got a damn small radiant shard :). &quot;<br />--------<br /><br />&nbsp; 1. its not the worst proc in the game<br />&nbsp; 2. u have no clue what yur talkin about<br />&nbsp; 3. this weapon is the warriors best friend<br /><br />its 10secs, u spin, but its easily canceled, just try to use a diff skill, it cancels, by failing in the channeling process (this proc is channeled when it goes off)<br /><br />this axe is a super rage builder for warriors, not to mention agro builder when there are multiple mobs (exactly what warriors want) and plus it makes u look sik!<br /><br />dont post ignorance...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok for all the retribution paladins this is for you! <br />When engaging a mob judge them with Seal of Crusder, then use Seal of command. When the axe procs your seal of command will proc with it 3 times in a row. MAD DAMAGE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok here's to clean up some questions about this...<br /><br />1) Shamans - I am enhancement and no the flurry doesn't break the proc in fact the animation speeds up kind of looks funny heh. Windfury DOES go off during the proc although you won't SEE the damage scroll up it definately knocks the health off appropriately. I will do more testing with this as I am only 37th and just able to use it.<br /><br />2) Paladins - I have a 60th paladin, I have been using this axe since I got it about last December. Since the last 1.6 patch I have found it will chain proc off itself now (Yes off of SoC as well). This is the hands of a paladin even 60th one is absolutely deadly in pvp provided people are dumb enough to stay in it's range. As an example for PvE it's STILL amazing even in the late raid instances. It's wicked fun in Zul Farrak at the temple fight with all the trolls, last time I ran guildmates through there no one even got hurt I spent the whole time chain proc'ing whirlwind and SoC off the top the whole fight lol was quite the sight.<br /><br />Anyway this is a very good weapon for both my Shaman and Paladin, working on my fury warrior so I'll find out for him too.</div>

So, if your character has this weapon &amp; you enjoy using it then good for you.<br /><br /> And for people who take offence at that.... watch someone die, then you might appreciate the 'real' life you've been given</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dont understand why a Hunter would use this.&nbsp; A hunter that has to melee something to death is already a dead hunter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>if you click on battle shout or anything else while it's proccing it cancels the proc. very handy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This is not very well suited for a Shaman.<br /><br /><b>First</b>: you can't get windfury to proc when you are all spinning around during the bladespin.<br /><br /><b>Second</b>: this actually <i>nullifies</i> WF - if the hit that initiates the bladespin also procs WF, the 2 extra WF hits will not do any damage. This happens more than you'd think and it's extremely annoying. I've had a mob at low HP and procced both WF and bladespin and WF definitely does not do any damage. Here is proof: <a href="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2064/ravagerne9.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2064/ravagerne9.gif</a> - you can clearly see windfury had no effect whatsoever.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if the very last hit of the bladespin procs a windfury, that <b>will</b> do damage (as long as one of those windfury hits doesn't proc another bladespin! I've had that happen). I think this is where people are getting confused with WF working / not working.<br /><br />Remember, every hit of your windfury has a chance of proccing the bladespin, which means there is about a 45% chance that every one of your WF procs with this weapon will do nothing.<br /><br /><b>Third</b>: Flurry has no effect on the bladespin, so any charges of flurry you have going into the bladestorm go to waste.<br /><br /><b>Fourth</b>: Proc rate seems about 15% or so. Not reliable enough to decide to suddenly start AOEing monsters; but if you are already hunting monsters in packs anyway then it wouldn't hurt.<br /><br /><b>Fifth</b>: casting anything will disrupt the bladespin. This is both good and bad. Good because you can cancel it if you want, but bad because casting any Shock spells for extra damage on a target will cancel the bladespin.<br /><br />I can say with complete confidence that this weapon will lead to a LOSS in true dps - for a Shaman, anyway - compared to another weapon with similar dps stated on the item, when dealing with single targets. Since Shamans don't get any good AoE's anyway, besides some very mana expensive totems, you are not going to run into many situations where you would want to use this weapon. One exception I can think of would be in an instance where you aren't healing. In PvP this definitely isn't worth it since you are always using your Shock spells, which would interrupt this weapon's proc.<br /><br />So, in conclusion: Shamans, the only two reasons you would use this weapon is if it's over 10 dps higher than anything else you can find, or if you are fighting (not healing) in an instance with a group. That's it. Hoped this helped some of you guys who were wondering how the Ravager's proc worked in detail.<br /><br />I've gone back to using my Corpsemaker, even though the DPS is 5 less (on the character screen,&nbsp; not the weapon itself) than the Ravager.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've been through 3 SM armory runs so far. First time shoulder's dropped, I chose need and so did a pally.

AE ofdamage is awesome to have and there are ways to stop you from tornadoing your way into the record books. All I do is hit one of my other spells (eg Mend Pet) and I automatically stop spinning. I'm a 42 NE hunter at the mo and hope to keep this axe for a while still. Can anyone give me some idea as to how long this axe is gonna last me before it becomes useless? Would appreciate it! Thanks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this at 37 on my first and only SM run on my warrior. I've used this up to level 49 (and still cary it around). Unfortunately it's a bit too weak now, but I bring it out for when I'm doing lower level mobs because it's great in groups.<br /><br />The proc is great. I ran RFD with this baby and anihalated all the regular skellys at the skelly boss (it procced twice in a row). <br /><br />It also amused me to get countless comments like &quot;what ability was that?&quot; and &quot;wow, you look really cool when that procs&quot;.<br /><br />Overall it's my favourite weapon in the game for I had a lot of fun with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Unfortunately, you can't move when this procs. This happens all the time with me, on the brink of me losing, it procs and i can just take 3 steps back, heal up, and pwn them when they get out of it. Great axe, but useless for PvP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I'm a 37 enhancement shaman, and I love the ravager proc. Its 5+ weapon dmg every 3 seconds, which is better than its normal attack by .5 seconds. In a sense, your hitting the mob/mobs faster while spinning. <br /><br /> I also like that you can click a spell that has some cast time on it to cancel ww, but not have to finish the spell, or come out off the WW randomly in a BG with a shock when people think your stuck there lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The chance on hit is pretty frequent. once every 5-10 hits.<br />The effect is very cool, you start spinning for 9sec, then every 3 sec you deal 130-400dmg to every mob within 5 yards of you. The effect can be blocked, missed, ect... you cannot move durring the effect and you can't stop it. That can cause problems some times with monsters sheeped or sleeping.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well it is called the ravager. I would say it kind of like magically going into a sort of berserk rage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok listen to this. i am a lvl 38 hunter. well we kileld herod. i wanted ravager right. well my best firend is a warrior who was there but he lieks his whielwind axe so he said i could have and so did pally. right. well this rouge was saying whoel thign dont need dont need. right. Well he rolls greed! i was liek what the hell! hes liek i could learn it with training. The whoel group is tellign him he cant. But before that he draws liek 25 people and he blames my friend for nto being a good tank even though everyone sruvived. So i had it with him. i said to him f off and f me, i rolled need got it he kicks me out of gorup and reported me and i get a warning lol. Well axe is amazing i used in pvp lol kicked @$$. Wow its funny when horde jumps yo and your damain em all psinning liek a balrina. And now i made a gnome warrior named miniherod on greymane. When he gets to lvl 39 hell have full scarlet and ravager lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, earlier this weekend I was in an Armory run. On my second run this axe drops, and there was another warrior that was lvl 33 that needed it(I was lvl 35 BTW). His friend in the group FORCED me to pass on it, because it was the only reason he was there. I then went on to say that he couldn't use it yet, then he said, &quot;u can't use it either yet so f off,&quot; then I said that he couldn't use it for longer then me, and he got really mad at me at that point and kicked me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i dont know why people say this is a bad hunter weopen.<br /><br />a hunter will mainly use ranged, so the proc isnt a problem when you dont need it. The proc is also great if you get attacked by many mobs at a time and can not escape. For a hunter it is also great in pvp. you will probably only use it when facing a melee class such as a warrior. Ul do a ton of damage against them and if they back away, just cast a spell and start doing ranged damage. This axe is the BEST when u needa kill a lot of mobs at the same time. The damage beats volley and it lasts longer. Overall this axe is great for hunters if you arent losing a lot of stats using it and if you know how to use it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>can other procs go off while you are spinning around? For example, say I have Seal of Command on and the ravager proc goes off, would I have a chance of hitting all the mobs around me with the ravager hit plus a possible SoC proc?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have run Armory about 18 times on my Belf pally and have never had it drop. It's either the helm or the legs that drop. I rarely get a helm but it's still there, I think 12.78% chance drop is pretty high in my experiance. And about you saying Bonebiter is better, that maybe the case, but did you ever think about HORDE? Horde cant even get Bonebiter, leaving Ravager as a better weapon. Next time don't compare without thinking about the other faction.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I found a nifty bug with ravager. I have a paladin with it, and whenever I land a hit during the spinning move, any buffs with a &quot;chance on hit&quot; effect proc 100% of the time!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I was doing solo runs in SM last night to bosses (run...feign death at boss to drop followers). When I killed Herod this dropped (surprised me).<br /><br />It's not a level 60 weapon, but it's cool as hell...procs often and racks up serious damage when it does. Even tho I'm 60 I'll be hanging on to this. If it rarely proc'd I'd probably dump it...but it goes off a lot. Fun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This AXE belongs in any Warrior's backpack for those instances when you need to take on a bunch of non-elite mobs. I still use it when I am in Zerker Stance and I am level 60. I recently needed to go to Uldaman to train my Enchanting Skill(yes I waited until 60 to worry with Tradeskilling). This thing totally destroies the traps where you get 9 Scorpians. Have also used it to get past the Rat traps that you find in STRAT.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got this the first time i ran the armory... heh<br />I got rid of it pretty quickly though...<br />Then later, after I had hit 60, I went back to farm the armory... So I could look like Herod XD<br />I got 2 of these axes while doing it... I found it much harder to get the helm.<br />I've only ever had that helm drop once, and that's while I was farming it...<br />But anyway, with the not being able to move part of it... All you have to do is either remove the buff, the weapon, or cast a spell, and it goes away... Hope that helps a little.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Oh and on a side note, all you people that say Ravager suck? Well you are obviously just jumping to obviously conclusions. Yes mobs run away and your left sitting there spinning, yes people will run out of the way in BG, but thats GOING to happen. And there are mobs that DONT run away, over think about that? I dident think so. So think deep and dont just assume it sucks due to obvious things every will realize before the person even gets it. (Mobs dont run away = Ravager spin will hit them till there dead if it procs)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>because you can hit Retaliation and within a few second's he alway's start's spinning and then for the duration of the Retaliation is does more DMG then you have ever seen if you havent done it..crit after crit after crit after crit, 1 word for it really,..Beautiful.. oh and if anything else is around they get the heck smashed outta them also... and yes, the way to stop the spinning if you can't hold the agro is by just hitting another option like taunt or hamstring or anything for that matter and he will stop...Best weapon ive had the privilage to use yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?241751">http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?241751</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>very strange, i wanted to see just how many mobs i could kill with this thing at once, so i trained a bunch, threw on sweeping strikes and retaliation and spun this baby up. Sure enough it starts chopping them up, but then i notice an odd thing happening. about 3 out of the 8 or 9 mobs i had on me were getting repeated misses, like 4 or 5 in a row it just wouldn't hit them. Something to keep in mind is that there seems to be a maximum number of mobs you can kill with this proc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This axe dropped for me when my friend was running me. I didn't really have any intention of getting it; I wanted the armor more so I could look Scarlet-y. The axe woulda helped, but I knew it had a low drop chance, so I didn't have my hopes set.<br /><br />So, it drops, and I'm like, 'Oh, hey, nifty. *hits need*'<br /><br />I luv it, like, totally. With +7 damage, it looks nice. It's procced off of itself so many times, and I have fun with it each time.<br /><br />Oh, hey Warriors! I don't know if this is already known or not, but you can cut the Bladestorm before it finishes by changing your stances. Nice for when you wanna switch in Berserker Stance so you can intercept the mage who thinks he cna get away from you when you're stuck spinning like a top.</div>

I managed to kill him, and I was looking at this Axe when all of Herod's people spawned. <br /><br />I decided that our dead Shammy should have a chance to roll for this item, so I turned and tried to fight. We died with about 6 of the minions left.<br /><br />Upon respawn, we found that the whole effing place had repopped.

So now im looking for about the 4th group run after that shammy friend. i get in one and, then i see theres a fellow warrior, i thought id discuss the drops with him turns out he *only wants the shoulders and helm* i told him id pass on the armour if he would pass on the axe (which he did know about) seems fair? welll he agrees and im happy, we get to herod and the ravager drops for me the second time i roll need, everyone else passes and guess what? the warrior backs down on the agreement and needs it, then he wins it! AND THEN THE PRICK IGNORES ME! so grievances aside (if u ever see buba on bloodscalp give him a /rude for me :P) &lt;~~~ i hate dishonesty. once more im looking fer a group at the doors to arms, and a extremely extremely generous rogue offers to take me through to get this axe (for free :D :D :D), and we did run it....at least 13times! One of those times the ravager dropped (unfortunately he stealthed to herrod, and i couldnt get in range to loot it), so by the time we get there the damn thing despawened! WTF!. Ive been through SM ARMS at least 24times so far this is total bs, but i try to be patient. But no luck tonight, cause at 1am at night i get a group get all the way to herod once again then....4 DAMNED MOBS SUDDENLY SPAWN (not the ones after herod, or the ones in the room before) is that a glitch? cause we died cause of it. Then we all rez and the damned instance respawned! all of it! so we fight all the way to herod and the room just before it still has those 4 extra mobs. So inevitably even tho we put up a good fight, we still died as aggroing normal mobs aggores the other 4 aswell &gt;.&lt; this is my luck is it? ive had to get favours from the swell guys in my guild and the ones out side of it. So now i am once again looking for a group for sm arms, im going to get this axe even if it kills me.<br /><br />/cry<br /><br />wish me luck for the for me next run(s):D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I definately agree with Hazestorm. This axe is pathetic compared to Bonebiter. The stats are wonderful and the damage is pretty much the same. Plus, even though the proc is good when your facing a large mob, it keeps going and going, and smart Humanoids will run away and avoid the proc and take the opportunity to attack you from range while your stuck whirling around like a spinning top.<br /><br />However, you can cancle the proc by using a skill, but doesn't it seem a bit rediculous to have to use mana every time you want to cancel the proc so your not completely helpless when it activates? This also has great consequences in PvP. Everyone that sees that axe will immediately know to run away and escape the proc once it activates. It's like performing a magic trick that everyone already knows how to do. <br /><br />Trust me, as a previous Ravager and Bonebiter user, I can tell you that when everything is thrown into the scales, Bonebiter will be rated higher. I've compared the two and you do much more damage with Bonebiter, and it gives you health, compared to Ravager, which in turn gives you an OK chance on hit while you are stat deprived.<br /><br />But thats just my opinion, and there are even fools out there that go with Ravager just because: &quot;it looks better.&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This axe is awesome. it's slighty better than the Whirlwind Axe, but when I do an instance run for gold in a place I can solo or taking some lower levels through, it comes in handy.

The Ravager proc happens often enough, but the Blaze seems far less common. Of course, this is a hunter, maybe a Warrior triggering Retaliation (or just spamming the usual warrior stuff like Sunder, Hamstring, and Rend) will have better results.<br /><br />Eh, one of these days I'll find out.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got it but its so annoying on pvp... useless. But overall a good two hand axe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I just got one of these a few days ago and its definitely a fun weapon but there are a few drawbacks in my opinion especially if you cast any spells.<br /><br />- Humanoid caster mobs will a lot of the times just move out of the way of your whirlwind and then they are hitting you with spells while you sit there spinning air for 9 seconds. <br /><br />- If your like me and like to wait until your health is down to 25% or so before you cast a heal spell, you find yourself screwed if you start spinning and are unable to cast that heal spell while something is still draining your health.<br /><br />- I don't think this weapon is real effective in PvP. Any person your fighting is just going to move out of your way until your finished spinning so your not doing any real damage to them.<br /><br />I haven't tried stopping the effect as you suggested above but I have experienced it stopping from something I'm doing so I'm sure your probably correct. I'll have to experiment more with that. That could definitely help with the usefulness of this weapon.</div>

Technically the DPS is .4 less because it doesnt have the STA stat, but I think that it consistantly hits harder. And the proc happens so often that I think it is definately worth the loss of stam.

However, <b>Windfury</b> does proc, but the effect does not trigger <b>until</b> the end of the bladestorm and triggers on the next swing, so use it wisely to cleave and target a specific mob to release your windfury on.<br /><br />The best way to see if windfury procs is through an addon or going to Interface Options &gt; Combat &gt; Enable Floating Combat Text.<br /><br />Also, you can use flametongue totem for your party members with this weapon, and it will work on their bladestorms.<br />Just windfury totem should have a similar outcome as windfury enhancement.<br /><br />In addition, placing down totems will cancel this bladestorm effect during a swing, so place your totems before or after you swing.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Enina</b></h3><b>The proc can chain from itself</b>, so if you have enough enemies, it will pretty much keep going until most of them are dead. It effectively hits as a regular weapon strike, and <b>it will trigger enchants and the like</b>. Multi-hit attacks such as Cleave and Whirlwind have a chance to trigger Bladestorm <b><u>per hit</u></b>.<br /><br />Beware of proc-fishing, because <b>using another ability during Bladestorm will end it</b>, so don't get too spammy with your abilities when trying to trigger it--you'll just accidentally cancel it if it does proc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hopesedge</b></h3>As a shaman Rockbiter weapon works amazingly well with this weapon for threat, it also increases the damage of your hits by a lot.<br /><br />I was levelling together with a priest, and one of our strongest assets was having me use this axe with rockbiter weapon, and pulling 5+ mobs with an improved stoneskin totem down. If it didn't proc we'd have to kill them slowly with things like magma totem and normal attacks, but if it procs it not only holds threat on everything immediately, but everything dies extremely quickly. It was even strong all the way through level 55, pulling 8 enemies in Un'goro Crater to aoe them all down was very efficient.<br /><br />Some more details on things I noticed: It can proc windfury weapon, but the extra hits won't happen whilst you're spinning, you seemingly get a invisible buff that gives you a windfury attack on your next normal attack within 3 or so seconds, so if you're spinning and you see a winfury proc animation (whirl of wind around you), then you can cancel the spin and get a guaranteed windfury on your next hit. sometimes the last tick of the aoe can proc windfury, which will immediately attack with that windfury doing a huge amount of burst, and those windfury hits can proc the axe again for you.<br /><br />When you finish spinning, sometimes the last hit will proc another spin, but the damage from the second spin will be applied immediately, if this happens it'll take 6 seconds before you actually do damage again with the spin, this is because your 3 hits over the 9 or so seconds are always limited to 3 hits, and getting 1 hit immediately doesn't change the time that the next 2 hits take place. So it's often better to just cancel the spin if this happens as 6 seconds of no damage can be a long time, especially if things are going to be dead before that.<br /><br />Frostbrand applies it's slow to all enemies it hits whilst spinning, which can be great to stop fleeing enemies during big pulls.<br /><br />Flametongue does about the same amount of damage as rockbiter but without the threat generation, making it the ideal weapon enhancement for dungeons if you're going to use this weapon.<br /><br />Using any abilities, or simply cancelling the spinning buff with stop the spin, this is extremely useful when you need to chase someone or run away.<br /><br />It CAN proc off of itself, leading to very long periods of spinning nonstop, sometimes it'll proc in the middle of the channel, sometimes right at the end as mentioned prior.<br /><br />If you get disarmed whilst spinning you'll keep spinning but with your unarmed skill taking over and doing damage, as such it's a good idea to keep your unarmed skill up to get a little bit more damage in those cases, or use a steel weapon chain to prevent yourself from getting disarmed!<br /><br />Whilst spinning you can't be knocked back, this is extremely useful in certain niche situations, for example some mobs like <a href="/classic/npc=9376/blazerunner">Blazerunner</a> will continuously knock you back whilst fighting them, but if you start spinning you will be rooted in place.<br /><br />Because the axe can only proc on melee attacks, be sure to use any abilities in-between attacks rather than on them if you don't want to accidentally cancel the spin if it were to proc.<br /><br />The attacks can miss, parry, block, dodge and crit.<br /><br />Trinkets and affects that can proc from attacks like Dragonbreath Chilli &amp; <a href="/classic/item=19289/darkmoon-card-maelstrom">Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom</a> can proc during the spin, making them quite valuable.<br /><br />Whilst you're spinning you're very vulnerable, and you'll be generating a lot of threat from the aoe damage (especially so if in Defensive stance, using Righteous Fury with Seal of Righteousness, or using Rockbiter Weapon), so be sure to wear heavier armour than you may otherwise like so healers don't hate you, elixirs of armour can also help greatly.<br /><br />Mobs with ranged attacks will attempt to run out of your melee attack range whilst you're spinning (as they consider you rooted), but the axe will still hit them due to it having an extended attack range, as a shaman against shooting enemies Windwall totem is your best friend for this, combined with stoneskin you can massively reduce damage taken whilst spinning and not spinning allowing you to safely pull multiple mobs.<br /><br />This last one may be a bug, but I've experienced it many times, sometimes your auto attack with proc the spin, the but spin will immediately be cancelled, I'm not sure what causes this.</div>
