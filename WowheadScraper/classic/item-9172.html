<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8214</b></h3>This potion has a lot of applications for players who like to explore dungeons solo (not needed for classes that have stealth of course) Just make sure you have your timing well figured out before drinking the potion (running naked in test runs will avoid the need for repairs) <br /><br />Mages beware that casting blink will break the invisibility. Running speed enchant to boots combined with the trinket &quot;Nifty stopwatch&quot; is the way to go!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chandrialla</b></h3>This potion has a long cooldown time, so it's best to be judicious in its use. It's pretty good for sneaking around certain places in Dire Maul, though. Also there are some crowded areas out in the open (like EPL) where it comes in handy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>37106</b></h3>Wondering, does this work like the mage spell invisibility? If so, the uses for this in raids are pretty insane. Pop potion, clear effect, you're out of combat in the middle of a raid boss. Drink/eat to your hearts content, and go back in the fight, effectively doubling your manapool. oO</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adashiel</b></h3>You can only use it out of combat, so it can't be used as an aggro dump.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>21265</b></h3>Hmmm i have a question about this thing.... If i use this potion and open a door, will i reapear ore still be on stealth?!?!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HighFive</b></h3>Any interaction, save for talking/emoting etc., cancels the effect. Including abilities that don't break stealth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First, no, Bernard the Mixer doesn't exist. I'm not sure why he's still there, but he simply doesn't exist. It's most likely someone uploading erroneous data to thottbot to confuse people.<br /><br /><u>Second, please make sure you read this, it is VERY important.</u> Although this potion works better than Lesser Invisibility, it shouldn't be used against elites. This potion (Invisibility Potion - the full, real-deal) isn't the same as Rogue's vanish, cloak, etc. I have verified many many of times of whether or not elites can detect this! THEY CAN! It doesn't even matter about the level! If you can't take on the mob you face, don't use an invisibility potion to get out of it if there are elites ahead, you'll learn the hard way what I learned.<br /><br />Good luck dieing. I suggest you test my theory in Darkwhisper Gorge (where I'm currently Shadowmelded). :)<br /><br />--Nick Betcher, CPhT<br />Certified Pharmacy Technician<br />Aka Phorin, Scarlet Crusade</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Note the 10 minute cooldown, so much for joining in on stealth runs... :-P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok first of all, this DOES NOT work when on a mount,(I've tried it many times). Second when invisibilitie is on even when you walk into someone you don't see thier name, you just see their form. Third both lesser and the regular potions are exactly the SAME!The only difference is one is longer than the other and harder to detect. Fourth, like someone said earlier you cannot use this while in combat. Though it is realy good in BGs like WSG when your outside the enemy falg room and need to get in unnoticed, both the lesser and this one give you enough time to grab it and go. I hope this clears some issues up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>To contradict a post from above these are just as effective as a rogue's stealth.&nbsp; I used 4 as a 60 priest to get to the Bar in BRD without killing a thing.&nbsp; You just have to know where you can stop to wait for the cooldown. (Also had to use mind soothe to get by one part)&nbsp; The elementals at the bridge didn't even blink as I ran in between the two groups.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>does this potion makes you drop on a mobs agro list? eg if you get agro as a healer, you take a potion, your agro drops or what?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since it can't be used in combat, it probably wouldn't affect aggro either... =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Mages beware.&nbsp; Just found out that this doesn't work through blink.&nbsp; I was trying to get to the bar in BRD, and was able to get past the door that the shadowforge gate opens without using a potion.&nbsp; But for the next part I used a potion, then blinked to save time.&nbsp; Next thing I know I'm being pounded on by like 5 guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Some basics for these potions<br /><br />-Drink this potion before trying to run past mobs in instance. Do not perform any interactions/cast any spells/try and switch any Arathi Basin flags etc or youw ill appear.<br />-If you are not a rogue use stealth basics (run far away from mobs not through them and stay out of their line of sight.<br />-Potion cannot be drank once in combat so you cannot use it as ghetto vanish.<br />-PvP Tricks level 60 rogue can watch a level 45 (enemy or duel) rogue drink one at point blank range and that rogue will disappear.<br />-I have persoanlly used these to suprise people in WSG. I am fighting mid field and having just killed someone I see a group across the battle field. I run towards them with speed on and hit invis potion. From their perspective they think I stealthed far away. I continue to get close to them then I restealth before the timer elapses on the effect and now can open with Cheap Shot--Totally freaks people out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i want to get the chest in the arena in stv and i was wondering if i drank one and the started opening the ches would i unstleath if i did?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>When you go invisible, the screen fades and the monsters etc around you disappear. It's as if you're running through a desolate area (cave full of mobs, you can't see any, they can't see you). <br /><br />Seeing as you wouldn't be aware of running right next to/into mobs, invisibility does just that, makes you invisible, whereas the previous version didn't. If you got too close you'd be caught.<br /><br />This is quite fun to use getting past elites etc that you wouldn't be able to solo. Expensive little trick, but entertaining :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I know you all said &quot;Totall invisabilty&quot; and i've used this potion, and before I use the last of my very hard earned herbs, I have to know, can you slip past enemy city gaurds with this potion, if so, alchimests can have a NEW role in city raiding,<br /><br />*Ponders this malicious plot*</div>
