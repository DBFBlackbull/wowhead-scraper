Plz feel free to form your own raid. You can just simply say. GREED on EVERYTHING. Either BOP or BOE. Let's see if you are be able to form a raid or not. You might think I am being too harsh.

Another factor which i havent read been very important here is, what some people do care about is graphics.\nIve myself played a rogue and never touched a healing class above lvl 10. (melee ftw! :D) but then i played my friends priest while he was making some food and all.. For the >>first time<< i was playing, i was >>with<< shadowspec laying on tops of healing meters in his\/my UBRS group owning 50%+ of all healing done. So i will sign on the fact that shadow priests can heal good, but a disp\/holy will do better.\n\n(ehm btw.. now when i have a chance as a melee playing player i will just state that to heal is so easy.. i should have made a healing class >.< just: click player, heal, click another player, heal, WTF aggro? fade.. (\"Have you ever seen any real action then?\".. ive seen healing done on raggy and vael, so yes ;))\nBeing a rogue and all taking care of aggro (which not all rogues posses the ability too) and being focussed on different locations and things to when this and that.. Thats more fun than just click\/heal :P imho\n\nBut what about feral druids.. They also want to go dmg and im sure many rogues whine as much as warlocks here does.\nI know.. i would be fustrated if any druid back in the time when i was doing UBRS and stuff, that if a feral druid won over me on something i would get a little fustrated about it :P\n\nConclution..

Now right after everyone entered the instance and opened the door I said that if dreadmist drops I get it, nobody disagreed (the only cloth wearers were me  -the warlock, a priest, and a mage) Right before General Drakk the Raid Leader forgot to switch to master loot and I guess nobody in the group noticed. When we downed Drakk and I saw Dreadmist Robe I rejoiced and made it clear to everyone that I was happy t dropped, everyone said gratz and pass on it. Strangely enough it was the last item that was awarded to someone. It turns out that everyone passed except the mage who took a while but eventually ROLLED NEED! He won the roll and took it. Everyone in the group got pissed at him, the priest and raid leader both said they were very sorry that I got jipped and posted on world LFG that the mage was a ninja. Pretty much half of the server agreed and half didn't. I whispered the mage and his excuse was \"I need stam gear I have like 2000 health dude!\" And when I told him that it was made for warlocks he said something like none of the sets were class specific and I need to learn to play. Anyway I'm still pissed off and venting my frustration, I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way.\n\nBy the way when i tried to put him on ignore after the instance run it said that no player of his name existed..... which is weird and I hope somehow a freak accident made his character disappear for being a greedy bastard.\n\nOh and the mage's name was Natenasty on Alliance side of Crushridge US","date":"2006-11-23T02:44:30-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"GFLenin","importedSubject":"OMFG NERD RAGE!!!!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":47,"id":3054760,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"I have a lvl 60 priest and I'm sorry but I don't get to play as much as you. I have a life you see. I have only ever been to about 5 or 6 high level instances since owning the game since it came out in 2005. So when I came went to UBRS the other day and dreadmist robes came up and I said I need that (as I have 3 pieces of the non rare stuff already). Nobody said anything do I needed it. Won it and then the warlock and everyone else starts moaning about me needing it. This is probably the only chance I will ever get to get that 4th piece of dreadmist and personally I think that the Devout stuff is crap anyway let alone the fact the chances of me getting a piece of it are slim to non.

Every classes out there has this same problem, where someone thinks they should be able to roll on it just because they to can wear it. Locks have 2 classes wanting the gear that was designed for them, all other classes were an afterthought.\n\nA mage wearing with the full DM set is just a joke, seriously your going 2 tell me extra stamina is worth throwing away your magister item set bonus? If you�re having problems pvping DM is not your answer. You�re probably thinking by now but I can use the bonus's, k you can use most of them, but you got this for pvp right? \nHow often are you going 2 take on demons when pvping? \nHow often are you going 2 spam shadow spells? \nHow effective is +4 shadow\/fire resistances?\nIf you think DM is still going 2 help you more than magister�s then I suggest you re-roll onto another class because you obviously don�t know how 2 play as a mage. If you want it because it looks sic that�s fine, just don�t roll unless both locks and Priests pass on it.\n\nShadow priests really can�t go any further than DM, most will end up respecing so they can take advantage of their epic sets. So once they start doing runs like MC or BWL their DM set becomes almost completely useless. If they roll on it over a lock just because its a good 'pvp set' then they are the ones being greedy, a warlock can use this gear for pvp and mc. If this is going to be like your epic set then you can take a little longer collecting it.\n\nTake a long hard look at the warlocks schools of magic 90% of our abilities are shadow, and the rest are fire. We can�t respec into the frost\/ arcane\/ and if we rolled on the magister�s set to take advantage of the increased fire damage bonus mages would cry bloody murder. SP�s I feel for you but understand like you all other sets suck for us, unlike you we cant simply respec to solve this problem. Locks have 2 deal with 2 other classes wanting the DM set no other class has to deal with that, have a heart and give them 1st pref.\n\nI'm not even going 2 aproach the area of which class is the better pvper\/dps cause thats really a matter of the individual players skills and talent setup, which is totally going off topic imho.\n\nEdited, Sat Jan  7 17:45:22 2006","date":"2006-01-05T11:46:56-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"kileeo","importedSubject":"locks 1st"},{"commentv2":1,"number":68,"id":3054781,"nreplies":3,"sticky":0,"user":"Allakhazam","body":"Yes it is true that both locks and shadow priests can use but evry1 knows to pass if the lock in the group has the item then the mages and priests can roll on it","date":"2006-01-08T08:13:31-06:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Not everyone knows that, I saw a mage roll and win the DM mask even tho the warlock in the group still needed it.","creationdate":"2006-01-12T22:29:42-06:00","id":1275916,"rating":0,"commentid":3054781,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"kileeo","importedSubject":"RE: both can use"},{"body":"I bet the 'lock is now a really big fan of ML for bosses, huh?","creationdate":"2006-01-23T00:53:00-06:00","id":1275917,"rating":-1,"commentid":3054781,"dataTree":1,"roles":64,"username":"Allakhazam","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false,"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"BgJonson","importedSubject":"RE: both can use"},{"body":"mmm, i'm guessing so, the sad thing is the lock and mage where both in my guild.

Get off the brainwashing that everyone feeds you. Can one of you justify why a lock deserves this set more than a shadow priest? Yes given that many SP respec at 60, then they don't deserve, but for dedicated SP they have just as much need for it as any lock. The only set bonuses on DM that favors any class is the shadow damage and the shadow crit bonus. The warlocks spells are about 70% shadow, so what! SP is all about shadow! DM has demon damage bonus, so what any caster could benefit from that and just cause your a lock doesn't mean it helps you more than SP or a mage for that fact. I hey, i totally agree that no other caster besides lock and SP only should be able to roll on this before them, as those are the only two classes able to put the shadow damage to work. So many people buy into the class only hoodoo that they overlook the obvious. Ohh mages get magister and priests get devout, cmon man, use your brain. Normally that applies but in this case it doesn't. And hey, not everyone is doing MC and BWL, so this is the set for them. So far what has been posted in this thread gives no justification to why lock deserves it more than SP.\n\nFor everyone saying SP has no place in end raids like MC or BWL or Onyxia, well i do all 3. I do them with my guild and i do them with allied guilds. Sure i am there as a healer but sometimes they don't mind me going dps if we have enough healers, which is not often. But as a healer there's not much diff between holy spec, and really disc gets the best benefits but cmon guys, the diff is marginal at best and will not determine weather your raid lives or dies. And yes i've played all 3 specs, shadow is for me. I have a 60 lock and a 60 SP, and SP is what i love most. So when DM dropped, i was rolling. I do end raids and pvp, i'm not respeccing everytime just so the raid can get 10% more on heals. If you want to pay my 50g respec, then hey, i will, but then i have to respec back, another 50g as thats what it tops out at. So alot of you have hate for SP, i can party understand, but cmon, don't be hating or be jeleous. Just accept i have just as much right as you to it.\n\nAnd for Vdubklown, your an idiot.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Robe of the Void or this? I kinda like this, and getting a set would be nice. . .but the shadow damage addition and the the ability to heal your pet for 300-400 sounds cool to me. . . The only drawback is that it only has 14 stamina, and nothing else. I really like that 21 intellect. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is it not absolutely clear that every class should stick to their own set? <br /><br />If you are a shadowpriest and some Dreadmist part drops you have absolutely NO RIGHTS AT ALL to roll on this if you are grouping with a warlock and he needs!&nbsp; STick to your own $%^&amp;ing set, they are made specially for each class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>A druid rolled for these...and won...so sad...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In all fairness a shadow priest in PvP might justfy using this. I would roll on it IF there was no warlock in the group. If there was and he needed it i would gladly pass. I think it's ok to have these items as long as you check with the people who they are specified to first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First of all, this is a warlock set.&nbsp; Shadow priests can certainly benefit from it, but not as much as a lock can.&nbsp; If a lock isnt present or doesnt need it, shadow priests should get the next shot at it.&nbsp; Healing priests and mages should only roll against each other, never against the beforementioned classes.&nbsp; Secondly, to say that a lock is useless is insane.&nbsp; I do as much or more damage than most mages.&nbsp; Locks have numerous specialty spells that are very handy and some are vital to survival in a raid.&nbsp; In pvp, warlocks are deadly.&nbsp; I'm always at the top of the list for killing blows, and quite frankly, I eat priests and mages for lunch on a regular basis.&nbsp; The priest's only chance of survival when it encounters me is to run.&nbsp; There's one simple reason for that, I'm playing my class as it was designed, and priests that feel they can combat instead of heal are seriously misguided.&nbsp; Finally, the statement about the set having agility and strength makes this a non-warlock set is ignorant.&nbsp; Check out the spells and combat senarios for locks.&nbsp; Firestone: enchants the main hand weapon with fire for melee.&nbsp; Can a lock stand toe to toe with a true melee class?&nbsp; Hell no, not in pvp, but in questing, combined with a VW and curses, a warlock can strike and damage very well while preserving mana.&nbsp; So again, the items stats further prove that this set is warlock based.&nbsp; This is a ridiculous argument.&nbsp; Blizz produced class sets and there seems to be no debate with the exception of this set.&nbsp; Crazy thing is, it's being debated by peeps with their own class specific sets.&nbsp; Get over it and roll on your own items, or create a warlock and roll away on dreadmist.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Those of you saying priests are meant only to heal..that is not true...blizzard did design the priest class to do decent DPS and be a force to be reackoned with. It is traditionally understood that priests are mainly geared towards healing, however, blizzard did design this class to be damage dealers as well. This robe is better for warlocks because of the high stamina and the set bonuses also seem to favor the warlock vs shadow priest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>In open raids.. if a priest rolls on dreadmist, I roll on devout...Priests, like rogues roll on items that are not intended for them, if no one needs it, by all means roll, otherwise let the class who it was designed for have first.&nbsp; This is why I'd rather have a Druid healing.</div>

I got 4 parts so far: the mask, the belt, the bracers, and gloves...<br /><br />UBRS 26 times = Not even seen the Robe drop...<br />Scholo 15 times = Got the mask, no mantle drop...<br />Strath UD 20 TIMES = NO BOOTS OR PANTS DROP ONCE!<br /><br />My final words would be....

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, I have to agree. I hate when other classes actually rolls on a warlocks set item.<br /><br />I play shadow priest, and I really want this set. But I'd only roll for it if there was no warlock in my group that needed it. Also, I always ask the others before I roll if it's okay. <br /><br />I hate &amp;*!@ing ninjas. No one except a warlock has the right to roll on these items, UNLESS there is no warlock who needs it. <br /><br />And I understand what ye mean mate. I had a frickin warlock rolling on a healing staff once. That was hilarious.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This page needs more info on were to get the item, and less on how everyone knows it's a lock item.&nbsp; And shadow priests are stupid. I saw that it's one of the BRS, but which boss drops it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've played a shadow priest and a lock and all I have to say is lol. Shadow is for leveling, and on a very slight occasion used to bolster WARLOCK damage in raids. Even if you manage to keep up with us in damage, where is your mana at? I did melt faces at pvp with my shadow priest, but with a lock I owned 10x harder.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Killroggmama has this exactly right, if you go look at <a href="https://www.worldofwarcraft.com" rel="nofollow">www.worldofwarcraft.com</a> and check the items-&gt; high level armor you will see that this is a class set. Yes it does not say it on the item itself, but how many shadow priests do you see wearing deathmist? NONE, because it is a warlock only quest to upgrade Dreadmist to Deathmist! ARGUEMENT STTLED!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>How many times have you guys seen a lock roll for Devout stuff if a priest was present? Show of hands? None? Ok...let me get this straight then. Priests can all of a sudden go both ways? Sounds a little Bi if you know what i mean. Go ahead and try upgrading the dreadmist stuff to deathmist Mr. Shadow priest. Go ahead....i dare you! What is that you say? You cant do it? Hmmmm seems to me that this case is closed for good. go ahead and complain you Priests but i dont think anyone here even holds what you say in any regard whatsoever. And By the way....i am a lock on the silvermoon server and i ALSO HAVE A SHADOWPREIST. But i wonder....what armor do i have, let me see. Oh my god its impossible...i have Devout! Good day everyone and have a nice life you shadow priests who dont know how to play your characters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok ok i get it its not for shadow priests! but were does it drop? i need to kno......is it scholo or strah? becuz so far all my dreadmist gear dropped in scholo <br /><br />the 1s tht droped in scholo were:<br /><br />#1 dreadmist belt<br />#2 dreadmist mask<br />#3 dreadmist mantle<br />#4 dreadmist gloves<br /><br />were does the robe, the sandles, the leggings, and the bracers? i have enough gold to buy the bracers if they were in the AH....but there not......so will ne1 answer my question?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Devout arguement sucks...... maybe..... but there is one thing for sure that shadow priest is no use for any big raid.... Like MC Onyxia BWS.... Dungeons like that. And if you feel like to do some shadow damge. Why dont you just pick warlock as your class? No matter how hard a priest try..... there is no way that a priest can do more shadow dmg than a warlock. Either afflication speci or destrustion..... I have been looking at this for a while..... There is some ridiculous BS....sounds like that mages and priests are all going after it.... Any smart guy can tell this is for warlock by the set bonus..... yes..... it adds more sta than other cloth set..... but both of mage and priest have shiled....... what does a warlock have? We do have a &quot;3&quot; sec AE fear. And by the way...Do you lifetap yourself to mana? I guess no! When I am leading a raid. Loot rules are mostly class basic. Upgrade goes first. IronForge goes to pally. Valor goes to warrior. Something like that. If a priest or a mage wants to roll for dreadmist. Sure........No problem at all. As long as the warlock in the raid has it already. then you got to roll for it. A pally roll for my dreadmist shoes. Do you think that it is fair? And the funny thing is he gets it. If you insist to roll. I will not give it to you anyway. It is all Master Loot in raid anyway. I think this is a fair rule for every class in the raid. If you dont like it. Plz feel free to form your own raid. You can just simply say. GREED on EVERYTHING. Either BOP or BOE. Let's see if you are be able to form a raid or not. You might think I am being too harsh.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I strongly agree sets do better for different classes. but Also What about the ppl that have never played games like this before.(like me) for example I rolled on preist set once on accident cause like i knew WOW game makers never put a class requirment on the items and i got yelled at for hours after i said i was deeply deeply sorry i was told sorry isnt good enough it made me quit playing for a long time cause i felt sooo deeply bad that is when i think this whole certain classes bull gets out of hand ppl that yell about it and cry for months about how they deserved this more and that more should realize that the items dont have classes written on them some ppl may not know hell i didnt know even anything about set bonus untill after i rolled so it just makes me a litlle upset when ppl guess what set was made for what pacific class when if it was just usable by a class then it should have the class written on it so newbies yes i admit i am a newbie what is so wrong with that ppl say newb like it is a bad thing when werent you all new at one point too? so the newbies know what to roll on and not roll on so they dont get chewed out for hours on end cause they made a mistake why argue a bout this crap i mean isnt there anything better to do then hold grudge matches but i guess some ppl live for drama.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>&quot;Best gear for shadowpriests. warlocks just whine and whine. both can use it and its the best for shadows so ueue on the warlocks. so your devout argument sucks.&quot;<br /><br />It's the lock set.<br />Plain and simple its the lock set, blizzard says it's the lock set because once locks have certain peices they can turn it in for their teir .5 sets, called deathmist.<br /><br />Still doubt me?<br /><br /><a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/" rel="nofollow">http://worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/</a><br /><br />check dungeon sets 1 and 2, under WARLOCK<br /><br />now tell me my argument sucks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I like how everyone argues about its shadow p or warlock. I say if you are in a party and people compalin that its for there character this and that I say dont party with them ever. Also for that matter never party with someone who starts telling you how to run your guy. Leave the party and make sure to tell them they are fools. Dreadmist is just another set. Argue up and down the river about it. A few class's can use it. Fair is fair, if there is a preist who wants it, a mage and a warlock in a party have them all &quot;need roll it&quot; Let the game of change make that choice for you. If you dont like it party with someone who &quot;thinks they know it all about every item in WOW&quot;<br /><br />&quot;fools who rush in dont find love, they get shot&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This rule is simple guys:<br /><br />Since this is the Warlock Dungeon Set 1 gear, only warlocks can NEED this, other classes Greed.<br />If there are no warlocks in the party then any other cloth wearer can need it.<br />So warlocks get priority.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Woot, just did my first UBRS run on my Warlock (lvl 58) and these dropped. A Mage rolled against me and won, but the Master Looter was reasonable and I got the robes. Great day. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Definatelly digging the look. Magisters set has a popup thing too except it isnt a mask so your hair glitches through that. This is a mask so no random hair sticking out the back. ^^ Mages ftw</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>to all the shadow priest that want dreadmist, STFU, it's obviously a warlock set (and no one's say u can't role just that us locks get first pick). By the way VengeanceX, the Devout Set doesn't have Priest class written on it either (same goes for Magister's Regalia for the mages), so unless you don't #$%^&amp; when a lock roles on Devout i suggest you go W A N K yourself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Well after reading replies and replies and replies to the latest reply etcetc. I just had to spam ehm write.<br /><br />Well here is my opinion to this case.<br /><br />To be totally honest i would say that dreadmist is meant to be for warlocks but that's not a reason for shadowpriests not to use it.<br />My friend and I have struggled for some time to get him full dreadmist and zulian ceremonial staff, which totally kickass. Another factor which i havent read been very important here is, what some people do care about is graphics.<br />Ive myself played a rogue and never touched a healing class above lvl 10. (melee ftw! :D) but then i played my friends priest while he was making some food and all.. For the &gt;&gt;first time&lt;&lt; i was playing, i was &gt;&gt;with&lt;&lt; shadowspec laying on tops of healing meters in his/my UBRS group owning 50%+ of all healing done. So i will sign on the fact that shadow priests can heal good, but a disp/holy will do better.<br /><br />(ehm btw.. now when i have a chance as a melee playing player i will just state that to heal is so easy.. i should have made a healing class &gt;.&lt; just: click player, heal, click another player, heal, WTF aggro? fade.. (&quot;Have you ever seen any real action then?&quot;.. ive seen healing done on raggy and vael, so yes ;))<br />Being a rogue and all taking care of aggro (which not all rogues posses the ability too) and being focussed on different locations and things to when this and that.. Thats more fun than just click/heal :P imho<br /><br />But what about feral druids.. They also want to go dmg and im sure many rogues whine as much as warlocks here does.<br />I know.. i would be fustrated if any druid back in the time when i was doing UBRS and stuff, that if a feral druid won over me on something i would get a little fustrated about it :P<br /><br />Conclution.. Allways ask before you enter the instance wheter anyone needs on Dreadmist robe or not.. thats what my friend did. If noone says anything after your 2nd or even 3rd try you have a reason to say.. Hey noone said anything = its mine.. kkthxbai<br /><br />P.S #$%^&amp;*!s needs nerf or rogue needs &amp;*!@#$% counter ability, kkthxbai<br />(I shouldnt have said that, but let the flaming (on me) begin ^^)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>a shadow specced priest can heal as good as any holy specced, the only difference is a spell or two one of wich works when u die...... and a few MPS on spells, tru shadow priest is lowest dps in caster group..its for solo'ing out in the world, click of a button in instance, and woot, full healer.. STFU :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I keep seeing ppl bringing up the fact this set buffs pets? I don't see where it says that it does that. Have they changed this set? I am a Lock and i want this set (especially since i am pet specc'd). I see the part where my damage against demons is enhanced but where does it beef up my pet?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>here is what you will be seeing warlocks running around in from now on.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Won twice, one with a 100 :D<br /><br />Never dropped a stupid devout that i seek much more.... -.-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Dude (MaGicUndeaD) you are a SPASTIC, i never said that magisters and devout weren't for mages or priests. All i said was that it doesn't have they're classes stamped on it, thus making it strictly their class set. This is the arguement that priests and mages make about dreadmist and why it's not a warlock set. Yeah sure, the bonuses are totally geared towards them but so is Dreadmist for warlocks. When i see a mage or priest with a pet, that's when i'll say that priests and mages have just as much right to roll on dreadmist. So next time, before you try to call me ignorant, why don't you read the post properly first *!@#head. Oh and please learn to spell the work ignorance properly before you try to label me with it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ill tell you why it matters what class get this, because i've ran UBRS countless times to get this, and it still hasn't dropped. And if i were to ever see it drop and have a priest roll against me on it, im pretty sure i would fall into cardiac arrest. SP ARE USELESS! There dmg is ^&amp;*!, and easily be out dmg by any other class. Ive seen pallys out dmg SP. So in conclusion, Dreadmist=warlocks, SP= AH grees because they dont desearve anything else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ehhe if any one is still argueing i play a lock,preist,mage =P tried diffrent specs one thing SD preist dps isnt half as low as ppl think<br />two if it was mages wouldnt cry about dieing to preists =P <br /><br />three by the looks of it only 1 set of your class can be upgraded to the better set so yea preist woudl be screwing locks over by taking it <br /><br />oh and for the love of god if your going to post here be helpful like telling use the stats :( <br /><br />sorry for posting this hope i see feedback on some real info :/ ppl want to know before the patch comes out =P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I had my second run through UBRS today and the robe dropped, I thought I was pretty lucky. Now right after everyone entered the instance and opened the door I said that if dreadmist drops I get it, nobody disagreed (the only cloth wearers were me -the warlock, a priest, and a mage) Right before General Drakk the Raid Leader forgot to switch to master loot and I guess nobody in the group noticed. When we downed Drakk and I saw Dreadmist Robe I rejoiced and made it clear to everyone that I was happy t dropped, everyone said gratz and pass on it. Strangely enough it was the last item that was awarded to someone. It turns out that everyone passed except the mage who took a while but eventually ROLLED NEED! He won the roll and took it. Everyone in the group got pissed at him, the priest and raid leader both said they were very sorry that I got jipped and posted on world LFG that the mage was a ninja. Pretty much half of the server agreed and half didn't. I whispered the mage and his excuse was &quot;I need stam gear I have like 2000 health dude!&quot; And when I told him that it was made for warlocks he said something like none of the sets were class specific and I need to learn to play. Anyway I'm still pissed off and venting my frustration, I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way.<br /><br />By the way when i tried to put him on ignore after the instance run it said that no player of his name existed..... which is weird and I hope somehow a freak accident made his character disappear for being a greedy bastard.<br /><br />Oh and the mage's name was Natenasty on Alliance side of Crushridge US</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I have a lvl 60 priest and I'm sorry but I don't get to play as much as you. I have a life you see. I have only ever been to about 5 or 6 high level instances since owning the game since it came out in 2005. So when I came went to UBRS the other day and dreadmist robes came up and I said I need that (as I have 3 pieces of the non rare stuff already). Nobody said anything do I needed it. Won it and then the warlock and everyone else starts moaning about me needing it. This is probably the only chance I will ever get to get that 4th piece of dreadmist and personally I think that the Devout stuff is crap anyway let alone the fact the chances of me getting a piece of it are slim to non. At the end of the day the more mana that I have the more I can heal and save your whiney little asses so STFU and stop being little byatches about it! It's only a game!<br /><br /><i>Edited, Jan 9th 2007 7:32am by Jimboom</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a Priest, I would love to roll on this. I'm not specced Shadow, currently Disc/Holy... but it would make a solid back-up set and PvP when I decide to go back into Shadow.<br /><br />That being said.. I would NEVER NEVER NEVER ever roll on this set when a Warlock is in the group and needs it also. I do however, expect second dibs. Warlocks definately have priority, as it is there set.. but if no Locks are there, or the Locks that are all ready have the piece that drops... I'm rolling. Plain and simple.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>im' a lock, but to tell ya da truth, this is as much a lock robe as a shadow priest robe, but obviously locks should get first priority, but there's always some one that is there to fuk u up and roll anyway, thats y it is better to set to master loot b4 killing a boss (unless to shadow priest is the leader Oo)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>For the SP who thinks he has the same right to this robe as a lock is a retard. First of its beyond me why the hell anyone would want to go SP in the first place. Of course i guess theres the benefit of being able to pvp a tad better but i can honastly say that i would rather have a holy or disp. Priest next to me in AV then a usless shadow priest. They are out healed by druids and pallys, and out dps by locks and mages. I guess i can see why a SP would want this but no way in hell should he even think about taking this before a lock. This isn't going to help there measly dmg so why don't all of you SP just give up and re-spec : /</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>yes but im a great protection war! And a great holy pally! and an even better SP!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hello all,<br /><br />I was wondering if you can make this Dreadmist Robe from a receipt or a pattern.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>na, as far as i know it's only a drop. You can't make it from a tailoring recipe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>If you are a shadow priest at the level you an get this I have only one thing to say to you: Get your ass to a trainer and respec holy. Nobody likes shadowpriests anyway. And least of all Warlocks that get their set ninjaed by selfish brats! If you want to do alot of dmg and dont like to heal then reroll a warlock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It's a given that this is a very nice set for shadow priests but warlocks should have 1st rights to this set. Every classes out there has this same problem, where someone thinks they should be able to roll on it just because they to can wear it. Locks have 2 classes wanting the gear that was designed for them, all other classes were an afterthought.<br /><br />A mage wearing with the full DM set is just a joke, seriously your going 2 tell me extra stamina is worth throwing away your magister item set bonus? If you�re having problems pvping DM is not your answer. You�re probably thinking by now but I can use the bonus's, k you can use most of them, but you got this for pvp right? <br />How often are you going 2 take on demons when pvping? <br />How often are you going 2 spam shadow spells? <br />How effective is +4 shadow/fire resistances?<br />If you think DM is still going 2 help you more than magister�s then I suggest you re-roll onto another class because you obviously don�t know how 2 play as a mage. If you want it because it looks sic that�s fine, just don�t roll unless both locks and Priests pass on it.<br /><br />Shadow priests really can�t go any further than DM, most will end up respecing so they can take advantage of their epic sets. So once they start doing runs like MC or BWL their DM set becomes almost completely useless. If they roll on it over a lock just because its a good 'pvp set' then they are the ones being greedy, a warlock can use this gear for pvp and mc. If this is going to be like your epic set then you can take a little longer collecting it.<br /><br />Take a long hard look at the warlocks schools of magic 90% of our abilities are shadow, and the rest are fire. We can�t respec into the frost/ arcane/ and if we rolled on the magister�s set to take advantage of the increased fire damage bonus mages would cry bloody murder. SP�s I feel for you but understand like you all other sets suck for us, unlike you we cant simply respec to solve this problem. Locks have 2 deal with 2 other classes wanting the DM set no other class has to deal with that, have a heart and give them 1st pref.<br /><br />I'm not even going 2 aproach the area of which class is the better pvper/dps cause thats really a matter of the individual players skills and talent setup, which is totally going off topic imho.<br /><br />Edited, Sat Jan 7 17:45:22 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yes it is true that both locks and shadow priests can use but evry1 knows to pass if the lock in the group has the item then the mages and priests can roll on it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Everyone that thinks warlocks has dibs on this set over a SP are f@king morons! Get off the brainwashing that everyone feeds you. Can one of you justify why a lock deserves this set more than a shadow priest? Yes given that many SP respec at 60, then they don't deserve, but for dedicated SP they have just as much need for it as any lock. The only set bonuses on DM that favors any class is the shadow damage and the shadow crit bonus. The warlocks spells are about 70% shadow, so what! SP is all about shadow! DM has demon damage bonus, so what any caster could benefit from that and just cause your a lock doesn't mean it helps you more than SP or a mage for that fact. I hey, i totally agree that no other caster besides lock and SP only should be able to roll on this before them, as those are the only two classes able to put the shadow damage to work. So many people buy into the class only hoodoo that they overlook the obvious. Ohh mages get magister and priests get devout, cmon man, use your brain. Normally that applies but in this case it doesn't. And hey, not everyone is doing MC and BWL, so this is the set for them. So far what has been posted in this thread gives no justification to why lock deserves it more than SP.<br /><br />For everyone saying SP has no place in end raids like MC or BWL or Onyxia, well i do all 3. I do them with my guild and i do them with allied guilds. Sure i am there as a healer but sometimes they don't mind me going dps if we have enough healers, which is not often. But as a healer there's not much diff between holy spec, and really disc gets the best benefits but cmon guys, the diff is marginal at best and will not determine weather your raid lives or dies. And yes i've played all 3 specs, shadow is for me. I have a 60 lock and a 60 SP, and SP is what i love most. So when DM dropped, i was rolling. I do end raids and pvp, i'm not respeccing everytime just so the raid can get 10% more on heals. If you want to pay my 50g respec, then hey, i will, but then i have to respec back, another 50g as thats what it tops out at. So alot of you have hate for SP, i can party understand, but cmon, don't be hating or be jeleous. Just accept i have just as much right as you to it.<br /><br />And for Vdubklown, your an idiot. If Blizz wanted SP to be only a healer, they wouldn't have made it. Look past your petty whinning and just admit what i said is true, cause you know it is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Wow Vectarian, weak sauce, weeaak sauce. No one cares what you think they should play for class or spec and it really has nothing to do with SP rolling on dreadmist. And SP a tad better in pvp, obviously you know nothing of what your talking about and can't provide any real valid reason to why SP doesn't have = rights to lock for this robe. And hey, no one cares if you would prefer a diff spec preist with you, as again, has nothing to do with this. Out healed by pally's and druids? Are you serious? There is a 10% heal diff between holy and disc spec. Disc and shadows heals are the same with exception of disc has better mana regen and 10% more mana. So really, that comment is saying pally's and druids heal better than any priest because holy's 10% diff is marginal at best. &quot;This isn't going to help thier measly dmg&quot;, ya, like it really helps a locks any better. If you don't want to group with a SP then don't, but if you are then they have just as much right as any lock for this set. I don't know if your just jeleous or just another disgruntled grunt looking to hack on something, but clearly i'm right and your wrong. Give me a real valid reason why a lock has more right than a SP, as your last post just tells us you hate shadowpriests with some bs thrown in for filler. Another sign of your weak sauce is your weak tactic of posting your approval hoping others won't look to see you posted it.<br /><br />Funniest of all is you don't even have a lock or priest.<br /><br />Edited, Wed Feb 15 14:01:34 2006</div>

I havent seen a shadow priest in a MC raid or Onyxia Raid....You probabaly dont know what I am taking about. You will understand when you are over lv 50. And of course you can roll... But I forget to tell you that in raid..... It is Mater Loot most of time. Any decent raid leader will not let any other caster to roll for Dreadmist robe but warlocks. So just wish yourself luck that there is no warlock to go with you... Newbies.<br /><br />Edited, Tue Sep 20 03:47:51 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>to all the shadow priest that want dreadmist, STFU, it's obviously a warlock set (and no one's say u can't role just that us locks get first pick). By the way VengeanceX, the Devout Set doesn't have Priest class written on it either (same goes for Magister's Regalia for the mages), so unless you don't #$%^&amp; when a lock roles on Devout i suggest you go W A N K yourself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've got a level 47 Shadow Priest as well, and I'd like to get this set for PVP purposes(The +2% Shadow spell crit is pretty tasty, and add in the +Shadow damage bonuses too).<br /><br />I won't roll on it if there's a lock in the partym but I will ask if they already have it if I can have it, which seems fair to me.<br />And that's simply because a lock is going to use it for both PVE and PVP, whereas I'd be using it solely for PVP/Soloing.<br /><br />Although once I hit 53ish I'm respeccing to full holy till I get the devout set, and then I'm going to be going for the Dreamist set so I can jump back and forth betwixt holy and shadow.(That may change, if I get into an Endgame guild)<br /><br />Although even a holy priest should get some shadow talents(Mind Flay comes to mind), and given the fact that the end talent for Holy sucks horribly(Holy nova = Ass)<br /><br />That's just my two cents of course.<br /><br />And to the people who think shadow priests can't heal:<br />there's a 5% increase in healing between holy and shadow, and an extra 5% Crit chance for healing spells between the two.(The Crit is the imporant part, 5% of 1500-1700[at my level) is about 75-100 extra HP per greater heal(Which you won't be using most of the time because of the 4 second cast(It becomes 3.5 secs with talents), which is about two hits from a NON-Elite mob.)<br /><br />That's it, plus the Shadow priest has more versatility as their SW:Pain can also heal via Vampiric Embrace.<br /><br />In instances I DoT the MT's target, and VE it,(currently that does 20-25 HP/every 3 secs non-crit, it may not seem like a lot, but it helps and it makes it so all I have to do is cast renew once in a while as well, which means they're getting ~125Hp/3 secs PLUS i'm doing a little bit of damage with the DoT, which helps end the fights quicker which means more mana left over and less downtime) and then I use my wand.<br /><br />If the warrior can't hold the miniscule amount of aggro(threat) generated by the damage and the miniheal, he's not doing his job properly.<br /><br />Edited, Fri Dec 2 03:46:40 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Not all parts of this apply to the topics in these threads, but read it anyway. <br /><br />Dreadmist is a dungeon set, not a tier set(you warlocks are posting in the tier one armor set forums). DEVOUT is the priest dungeon set. Get your facts straight instead of sitting on your lazy bums and complaining. <br /><br />ALL TIER ONE/TWO/THREE ARMOR SETS are indeed CLASS SPECIFIC. <br />Any guild will screw you up for that. DONT ROLL ON TIER ARMOR SETS. <br />Allakhazam may be a nice site, but not everything is correct. This is why they update every couple days. Thus the reason why some tier one/two/three sets do not show up in class specific. <br /><br />DUNGEON SETS ARE NOT CLASS SPECIFIC! <br />Dont be idiots and roll agaisnt a warlock=dreadmist who needs the set. SAME for mages=magister and priests=devout. You wont get the upgrade that the actual class would get (dungeon set two). And you give THEM the right to roll agianst you, so dont complain about warlocks/mages/priests rolling against you for your own armor sets when you are doing the same thing to them. <br /><br />I AM A PRIEST and HATE to hurt others by rolling agianst other classes, so dont attempt to twist this. Some of you are sitting on your lazy bums and believe every single thing that Allakhazam says. Not a good move. <br /><br />Blizzard created those sets for those classes (SET BONUSES CONFIRM IT), they are intended for that class BUT they are not class specific. My point: Warlocks get the priority on Dreadmist, Mages get the priority on Magister, Priests get the priority on Devout. BUT if there is the rare case that no warlock/mage, warlock/priest, mage/priest are not in the group, then by all means roll. But you are idiots if you roll on something that gives set bonuses you dont need, especially if there IS a player that needs it. ( does not apply to shadow priests but still warlock priority) <br /><br />CHECK THE LINK! It will tell you the true facts and which class/set they are MEANT for AND this link is from Blizzard. It's correct. <br /><a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/</a></div>

As a priest I picked up 3 pieces in the AH and slowly accumulated the other pieces when there were no Warlocks in the group. For the record, I would never roll against a Warlock for a piece of dreadmist. Anyhow, I havent tried it out in the B/G's yet and was curious about how often it procs. Seems like the set bonus would be especially nice to rid myself of some of those silly rogues sneaking up behind me. <br />Backstab<br />2 seconds of fear<br />Bubble...heal<br />Warrior buddy starts smashing face. <br /><br />Anyone's experiences would be appreciated.<br /><br />Reydin<br /><br />P.S.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>It is save to say that some SP's and Mages going to swipe the gear away from a lock. Its a good starting gear for end game instances. <b>A SP will never, and yes i say NEVER out damage a pure warlock of anyclass. Even if they are affliction / demonology specced.</b> <br /><br />Save to say, that this is a true Tier 0.5 set for a lock. Magistrate is a Tier 0.5 set for Mages and the Devout set is a Tier 0.5 set. <b> With the Tier sets i mean a nice set to begin end game instances with to grow later on a full tiered set</b>. Stick with the plan and don't over do yourself. It makes me want to kill people if i see somebody swipe away gear that shouldnt belong to them because i know i will see it later on AH. <br /><br />Play nice and all, cuz yer getting ignored more and more.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This is a warlock set, it's been described as a warlock set, warlocks can upgrade it, shadow priests always come second and if I had this set I'd let a priest roll Need but only on the items I already have or if there's another warlock, items that both of us have. Also assuming this isn't a guild run, just a normal LFG thing, the priest is likely to try out all new shadow gear and stop healing which is never a good thing.<br /><br /><i>Edited, Aug 3rd 2006 at 8:16am EDT by Kild</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>got my robe on second run too:), but took about 25 for mask anyway.<br /><br />after finishing my entire dreadmist set, i am satisfied and very pleased with look, stats, and set bonus's of our set. the pvp set reward for warlock may be slightly better then this then sta/int, but i prefer dreadmist entirely. dreadmist has +2 hp regen and +95 spirit so you are looking at much smaller downtime in pve. pvp set reward has 0 spirit, 0 hp regen, meaning longer downtimes, also even dropping the minor agility. i regen about 60+mana a second, having over 200 spi, dropping 95 is almost cutting that in half, to little more then 30mana a second instead. untill blizzard adds spirit and +crit% to our pvp set, its garbage, at least for pve. spirit is useless in pvp, but im pve person. you also drop the +2%crit chance, gaining only minor +dmg to each peice. +crit%&gt;+dmg. slightly more sta/int isn't worth the loss to me, nor the look. have you seen the pvp set for warlock as alliance? you would be disgusted... dreadmist all the way. another one of blizzards cruel jokes, giving goths a bright red/yellow color of armor... i would look at them like they were stupid and say what is this? only color i'd like is BLACK or purple, you did great job with dreadmist, so... wtf? did designer of dreadmist quit when it came time to make the pvp set reward for warlock, then get replaced with colorfull mage player? .... save yourself and don't look for a screenshot of that set, you were warned.<br /><br />as for priests demanding our dreadmist, i could only label them stupid or greedy. their pvp set reward is better then dreadmist just like ours is, and no decent raid leader would allow it. they just want it for the looks rather then the stats and they know it. i don't see how it'd be worth the trouble. i never had to roll against priest for mine, and if raid leader told me I had to, id leave raid. our set being just for us is what gives us non-lucky-roll-always-losing-people an actual chance at something decent. dreadmist is only thing that didn't take 10+ runs for, that being just to see a drop, not win. this would be like destruction warlock wanting magisters for +fire, or paladin wanting valor for max tankage, you can be 100% sure they'd have a problem with that. people that get full use should come first, before people that would only get partial use, just like giving +healing item, to priest/druid, over pal/shm, which some raid leaders do. warlocks are 2/3 full shadow with almost all spells being shadow, priest however, only a third. need to just accept whats made for your class, and everyone would have much more fun game experience. you always have the pvp set otherwise. i just have to say, that if priest wants our dreadmist, they better not be upset when warlock then wants his devout, and makes up some random reason for having any real use, which is same thing priests are doing.(our drain life and siphon life are healing spells! i dont care if you have 10 times as many healing spells and are main healer, +healing is for us!) (read that and im sure you should understand our point of view)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Priest should not roll as u have your set. We cant use your set as it sucks for us. So why should you use ours if there is a lock in the group its just selfish</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>wow... im a 40 shadow priest, and im already thinking about getting this for myself, if a lock is in the group.... i couldnt careless... no where on the item does it say &quot;Classes: Warlock&quot; it is an item usable by all classes (whether they need or not) there are no restrictions on the item so if it drops im rolling, to all you retarded locks saying &amp;*!@ like &quot;warlocks are 2/3 and priests are 1/3 and no matter how hard priests try they will never match the damage we do&quot; well yall are wrong, sure you have MORE shadow spells then us but ours do the same amount of dmg if not more, so yall can jus stfu cuz im rollin and there aint nothin yall can do about it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Obviously this is the best superior quality set available for a Lock. So I would agree that Locks get to roll first if they need the set piece.<br />But lets take a look at the priest set. If you'r a SP, the devout set sucks bigtime. Yes, this is also the best set for a SP. So every priest that wants it and is forming group with a lock should at least tell him that he's rolling for it. You lock ppl should undertand that, end of the line.<br /><br />I see a lot of locks insulting SP's.<br />1. <b>Learn to play your class and heal!</b><br />WTH would Blizz give a priest shadowtallents if it wasn't like their class. A SP is still a better healer then a pala or better (faster) then most druids.<br />2.<b>Take Holy ffs, your class sucks in dps!</b><br />True, if you Holyspec. A priest with Shadow on the other hand is a dpscannon if you know how to play it. The only class we can't catch up are rogues, but if you got some skill a SP can do even more dps than a Hunter. Certainly more than a Mage or a Lock.<br />3.<b>Priest should holyspec at 60. You won't get into a MC raid if you don't.</b><br />Why woold that be? A sp is still the second best healer. We only heal slightly less good then a Holypriest. <br />Oh, and two things: <br />* Most guilds will take any priest to MC, just because you don't find that many healers (at least not on my server).<br />* Why do you think a priest woold Shadow spec and then want to go MC? Shadow is purly PvP on 60.<br /><br />I could go on and on. But I only have to say this in the end. To the noobish Warlocks, if you had some skill playing WoW you would have picked a priest and given him Shadow. To the skilled Warlocks, respect in PvE, but I'll own you in PvP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As a warlock currently trying to get this item, I can definitely see how a shadow priest would want this.<br />As long as the priest understands that the warlock should get first dibs. I would definitely be pissed if a shadow priest took this away from me and then, two levels later respecced and needed new armor. AND, I definitely like having priests as healers more than as DPS'ers. Because there is a shortage of healers on my server and I think if you can heal you should take advantage of it.
