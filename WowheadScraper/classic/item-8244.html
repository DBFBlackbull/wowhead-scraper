<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just got a stockade pauldrons and a bonesnapper <br />from one ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well was not trying - I had given up on that but farming runecloth one dropped off one of the undead sorcerers It is totally random who drops them so there is no perfect place to farm. I too received a Widowmaker and of course the 5g some odd amount of silver you get as well! - selling on our server now for only around 38g so I am holding on to mine as they usually sell for around 70g.<br />Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just kited all the way to stormwind, then let volvar do all the work. its that easy!<br /><br />Thanks to Tans(60 hunter), Amynta(60 hunter), Spivey(60 hunter) and my self(ottiki, 60 uber l33t druid) from Feathermoon done it, so if we can do it, you can too!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Me and my friend &quot;killed&quot; teremus. Im hunter lvl 52 and I kited it with 60 lvl prot spec tank to GG. I just kept shooting him with arcane shot. placed frost traps to his route and kept aspect of cheetah on. when we finally got to GG the guards killed it in 5 minutes. we got the loot ;) piece of cake. The trip to GG toke like 30 min so it respawns every 24h so its 100g for 1 day ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got bored and kited Teremus the Devourer all the way from BL to SW keep where he got waisted by the marshal (im a lvl 60 hunter) which took me like 15 mintues or so, and all i got was this bloody sphere, which gave me <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Soulkeeper">Soulkeeper</a><br /><br />was fun kiting him though, loadz of people following us when entering SW and i was lucky enough to get healed on the way in cuz he managed to hit me a a couple of times with his fire thingy. guards took aggro a few times but oddly enough i managed to take it back (and he kept regaining his health till we got to keep 0_o)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Clarion Call kited Teremus to SW on Skullcrusher. Dropped the flawless spheres. <br /><br />Don't know if it is worth it, but it is a lot of fun to watch the lowbies die in SW.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I tried to kite him just yesterday on my hunter seems nearly impossible this guy loses aggro incredibly fast even when i attack him, i can usually kite stuff fine, but i am having a problem with him</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Is this still a random drop? I have been playing for days and days and have come across 3 flawed but no flawless. Is it now just a drop from the boss?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ive killed Teremus twice in the last week, both times dropped the Sphere.<br /><br />And both times I got Krol Blade =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got a sphere from one of the vultures, only had to kill about 10 of them.&nbsp; I got Guttbuster (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13139/guttbuster">https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13139/guttbuster</a>) from the quest which I DE'd</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Randomly dropped off of a 49 basilisk while grinding from 48 to 49. Haven't turned in yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Got one today from the NW camp in Blasted Lands off of the ogres.. between this an my Hyacinth Macaw drop a short time ago, I'm one lucky bugger.. now if I could only get two more damned vulture gizzards. lol<br /><br />Turned the sphere in for 'Stonerender Gauntlets' (epic), 'Sandles of the Insurgent' (rare), and 'Revenant Shoulders of the Bear' - not entirely sure on the last one though. Sweet deal.<br /><br />I got a nice pair of bracers, but I'm pretty sure those were from the flawed fragments (got that drop shortly after the sphere), and a pattern for a 'Red Mageweave Vest' but I think that was a mob drop..<br /><br />(I need to have a string of bad luck for drops for a long while now, I think..)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Mar 21st 2007 6:55am by rjjb</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Slyfanitor</b></h3>The price for these on the AH in Classic is unbelievable, average is about 125g each and it makes no sense, even if you got insanely lucky and got a boe epic from the chest even then you wouldn't make even half of the price of the crystal itself back on the AH 99% of the time. Yet they keep popping up on the AH, don't know if they actually sell or if the people who have them just try for a bit and then go use it themselves.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jwaggin</b></h3>In cata + rare spawns are guaranteed to either drop the flawless or imperfect crystal, seems to be about 50/50. I have an alt parked in the blasted lands and fly around every ~6hours. Ive opened ~50 so far and no epic</div>
