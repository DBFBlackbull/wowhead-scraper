<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has anyone been able to buy the recipe from the vendor?&nbsp; Every time I visit her, she does not have the pattern.&nbsp; I even waited around for about an hour periodically checking for respawn of the recipe, but no luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>All the above voodoo stuff is not what gets you the pattern.&nbsp; It is just a timed pattern.&nbsp; I visited Gigget one evening, no luck - including the owlbeast, non-Tauren, and other 'tricks'.&nbsp; I stuck by her when I logged off.&nbsp; Logged back on the next morning and the pattern was available.&nbsp; I'm guessing its a 24 or 48h respawn affected after each purchase.&nbsp; It is available to Horde, but I can't speak for the Alliance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Got this today.&nbsp; Took about 2hrs from when I first checked the vendor.&nbsp; Didn't do any of that freaky voodoo stuff other posters have been mentioning. :)<br /><br />Just be patient, and gank any other vendor campers you find. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've been trying to get this recipe for 4+ hours now. Does anyone know approx. what time it respawns in?<br /><br />I know it means you have to camp it for an entire spawn period - but maybe someone went there twice for kicks? ;)<br /><br />I'll continue checking every 30 mins. or so... good thing my work PC can run WoW :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hi, i just went to the vendor.&nbsp; no pattern.&nbsp; went and killed an owl beast, pattern now available.&nbsp; strange coincedence?&nbsp; maybe, but if the pattern isn't there go and kill one just in case!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well i did what everyone else did, killed the owlkins and nothing, so it musta been bug, and a new patch was just fixed so they might of fixed it with the patch :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just ran temple and decided to see if this recipe was up. This was my first attempt and she had it! So awesome! Now to farm the mats. Oh yeah, it's 4:58AM... Long night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The pattern is only a timed spawn...yet to test what the spawn time is, but it has absolutely nothing to do with killing things/talking to other npcs/performing the ritual raincaller dance or whatever.<br />Nor is it true that only one of the patterns can be there at a time. I checked the other vendor first and the mithril dragonling pattern was there - I didn't buy it.<br />Then I walked out and checked this gnome and he had the Ironfeather shoulders pattern - I bought it and logged out at the spot, so I'll see if it's there again when I log back in a few hours.<br /><br />So just be patient and keep going back over and over, and if it's not there, don't waste your time, just go and do something else and check back later.<br /><br />EDIT: I logged back 5 hours after buying the pattern and it has not respawned yet.<br />So either someone bought it while I was offline, or the spawntime is longer than 5 hours.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>OK, you can say this is just coincidence, but 3 times?<br /><br />I've tried this 3 times since 3 months ago (when I first posted about it), and every time the ironfeather shoulders pattern did not exist at all until I bought the dragonling pattern from the other vendor.&nbsp; Every time, I buy the dragonling pattern from one vendor, wait 5 minutes, then the ironfeather shoulders pattern appears at the other vendor.<br /><br />All the timed spawns like this still show at the vendor after you buy the last one (like the dragonling), but the ironfeather shoulders pattern *dissappears*.&nbsp; It is NOT a simple timed spawn, otherwise the entire item wouldn't dissappear from the vendor's list.<br /><br />Again, I literally sat here for about 20 minutes and bought two of each of these patterns (dragonling, wait, then ironfeather shoulders) one after the other as I described above.&nbsp; NOBODY else came, I didn't log out, just buy one, wait, then buy the other.<br /><br />I don't think this is a fluke since I've tried it 3 times...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i've seen two diffrent areas to search for this npc in now, could you please tell me what one is correct?<br /><br />Winterspring 34,38 Or..<br />Hinterlands 34,38<br /><br />? thanks much!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i went to 34, 38 didnt see the pattern, i went in the hut to buy te schematic for the dragon, went back still wasnt there, went t quel danil and killed about 3 highvale people, went back still not there! finnally i went to here yes thottbot, read of of your forums and when i came back BAM it was there!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>W00t. I was kind of discouraged reading all the messaged on this page, but I went there. I was in a haste and needed to get the pattern quick before I went into an instance. Wonder above wonder, it was there! Got it now without any problems.<br /><br />/me happy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well, after reading a bunch of opinions about this vendor item, I think that I'll go with the &quot;You have to kill stuff&quot; approach. I went out to the Hinterlands and I checked the merchant that sells the pattern. Nothing there..so for fun, I went down to the lodge and ganked 3 Highvale elves and then dropped 3 owlbeasts, in that order. Went back, and lo! It was there.<br /><br />This happened at 8:46pm Pacific Time on Magtheridon, for anyone who wants to test out the timer theory.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went to this vendor and she didnt have it. went and killed a couple of nearby wolves (to waste some time) came back and waited a little while and it appeared - at 12:12, so I bought it. <br /><br />Now out of curiosity (to test the timer theory), I waited there periodically checking, and at 12:36 pattern again there, so I again purchased.<br /><br />had to log out so couldnt check at 12:56ish to see if it was there again to confirm 20 minute timer. <br /><br />Logged back in about 6 hours later - and it was there again so I bought it once more! <br /><br />This was on khaz'goroth, and just so I dont get flamed - I gave 2 of the patterns to my guild, and one to a mate whos a tribal leatherworker who's gona make me the shoulders! (now to get 80 ironfeathers!).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I went all the way to the vendor and checked and no pattern.&nbsp; Logged out and back in instantly and there it was!&nbsp; So not quite sure what happened there - lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>so i followed then farming and the buying but nothing still.. how long do i hav to wait urgggg!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blizz must have changed Re-spawn time cause i bought this pattern 3 times in one day.&nbsp; All i did was wait about 15 to 20 mins., and there the pattern would be.&nbsp; Just enough time to hearth to Org., catch a flight on the zep., and Fly to the camp in Hinterlands.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I waited like 3 hours and then got two of them right in a row, but then it didn't come back after an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Now whether or not this is actually true, I don't know. I got there around 10:15 or so and a human warrior was there, afk. Decided to be considerate since I knew I'd get pissed if they popped and waited. Went afk a bit, came back and she was gone, so I sent her a whisper.. and she had just bought them. Time noted - 10:37pm. Right on que at 11:37, they came up. Mystery solved? Guess I'll have to go check at 12:37 if I remember!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I checked Gigget Zipcoil. Nothing. I bought the dragonling schematic from Ruppo Zipcoil, waited 5 or 10 minutes and talked to Gigget Zipcoil again and got it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You might as well take all the buy this do that crap and forget it. It went exactly like this i wait for 58 minutes checking every minute i bought it and waited for it to respawn again which it did 1 hour and 48 minutes later and i dodnt buy it. 1 hour and 49 minutes i checked to see if it was still there and i am the only one here. It was gone.<br /><br />She is named Gigget Zipcoil located at 34, 39 in the hinterlands which is up in the hills. If you walk up and its there buy it and thank your lucky stars because you randomly got it at the right time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Arrived there and there was no pattern. I looked up this item on thottbot to find all the strategies that appear to have not worked.<br /><br />I tried getting up and making two pieces of toast and two toasted bagles. I applied apple butter to the TOAST ONLY. I came back to my computer, checked, and the pattern was right there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I guess I was the lucky one since I found the vendors, bought the mechanical dragonthingy, and the&nbsp; ironfeather shoulders all in 5 mins. (I did sell something to her before the pattern appeared)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The item was there roundabout 8:30pm on a Tuesday night, but I may have been lucky after the server maintenance. Coordinates are about 35,39, the path to those coordinates goes up the mountains on the northeast side of the lake above Quel'danil lodge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Who: Beck<br />What: Pattern: Ironfeather Shoulders<br />When: 1:28 AM server time<br />How much: 1g 40s<br />Server: Shadowsong (Horde)<br />Sold from: Gigget Zipcoil<br />Special procedures taken: None, The trick to this is waiting.<br /><br />Hope it helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finally after long long hours spent waiting for that Pattern I got it, exactly 7:11pm server time, Echo Isles, you dont have to be doing anything unordinary, just stand and wait, thats gotta be timedrespawn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just stood next to her and w8ed until i could buy it, took max 1h, they dropped <b>4:42 pm</b> . 1g 40s.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just bought them.<br />the time was 10.52 pm and it was on Wildhammer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have waited for this pattern on 3 occasions for an hour. i still dont have it lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I've made the trip a couple af times.&nbsp; Went up tonight and at first it wasn't there so I farmed for the chest piece.&nbsp; Wasn't succesfull on that either so I came back to check and it was finally there.&nbsp; Yay.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Well I started to read all the beginning posts about this Ironfeather pattern drop. I went to the vendor and checked, no pattern. So, I read a little and decided to talk to the engineer. Said and done, went back to the trade vandor supplier and there it was! I don't know if this has anything to do with the pattern &quot;drop&quot; but try it! I wasnt around the engineer and trade vendor for more than 5 minutes. I mean it can't only be luck that I did get it after 5 minutes if the &quot;spawntime&quot; is 24 hours or whatever everyone says it is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i did all your guys theroies but no luck at all.. so if anybody on laughing skull get or have the recipe i would gladly pay up to 15g for it.. Char. name is Geden</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>i am at vendor but the pattern isnt here</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took me a while to log in here, but anyway.. Yeah it's there. I got it a few minutes ago. It wasn't there, but it took around an hour after first checking the inventory.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I picked this pattern up over the weekend. It sold for 14g on Feathermoon. I have gone back everyday since then (several times a day in fact), and she doesn't have it. Those darn capitalists! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Anyone know the spawn time on this from the vendor? Or if there has been a change with one of the patches?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if anyone does have anything on how to get it or if its just a very rare spawn please let me know<br /><br />Edited, Tue Aug 16 13:28:38 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I bought it at 11:20pm pst on Ursin after waiting well over an hour for the second time in 2 days</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Yep, must have a long respawn time, or someone knows respawn time and is camping it :(<br /><br />Edit: Just got it, exactly as listed vendor is correct :)<br /><br />Edited, Fri Apr 8 21:14:12 2005</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The vendor wouldn't sell it to me so i went back down, killed 3 wolves, 5 trolls and 1 owlbeast. When i went back up again got the pattern.<br />Maybe just a coincidence, but worth trying.</div>
