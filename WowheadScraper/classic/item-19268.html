Rogues and druids are of course the obvious solution. Basically go left in the instance to the gatherings of dwarfs where there is an officer and 5 of his underlings. It is suggested you kill the one flame walker guy prior to the dwarves as its just easier. There are two single dogs (dogs see stealth and invis) to each side of the first dwarf pull and these dogs can be killed without pulling the dwarf group. Pull the dog on the right and kill it. Then hug the right wall. You cannot sneak past the first gathering of dwarves without stealth or invis, the officer will aggro. I suggest you try this once or twice without an invis pot to get a feel for when he aggros. Once you have a feel for when he will aggro on you slug the potion and start running for the gate. Once you clear the first Gathering of dwarves hang a right and head for the door and the pathway to Incendius. Stay in the middle and away from the wall there is a dog patrol along the right wall. As you run your invis potion is 18 seconds as your potion begins to run out stear towards the right wall and give yourself wide bearth to all the dwarf patrols. There is enough room if you are level 60 to navigate around all the dwarf patrols without invisibility or stealth. I have done this as a mage with two rogues. Here is the part I am unsure about. Once you clear the large door you enter a room with one last dwarf formation. Past the dwarf formation you walk down a narrowing hallway with those fireguards on either side. You can navigate around the Dwarf formation no problem. On all of my runs we kill ALL of the fireguards before incendius. If you wait long enough the dwarf formation leaves through the door and probably lets you walk down most of the narrowing hallway without invis (this part is theory craft) the last two guards will have to be killed or you will have to use another invis pot if you are trying to solo as a non stealthing class.\n\nThere maybe someone can use all that.","date":"2005-11-01T07:17:56-06:00","rating":15,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"goodpancakes","importedSubject":"<Blank>"},{"commentv2":1,"number":9,"id":2705607,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"With fire resist gear, lord incendius is really easy.&nbsp; I'm a warlock and I can solo him and come out with over half health and mana.&nbsp; He's also really easy to solo your way to him, and you don't even need invis pots or anything.&nbsp; Go into BRD and go through the door to your left, then immediately to your right, and then again to your left to get into the East Garrison.&nbsp; Go up the first set of stairs, and head down the path to your left and jump out of the window.&nbsp; As a warlock i just sacrificed my voidwalker and ran past the mobs and out the window.&nbsp; as a mage you could just frost nova + blink, etc.&nbsp; once out the window, go to where the fire elementals are, and you only need to fight the last set of them, and you are at indendius.&nbsp; He dropped the ace for me once and he always drops nice FR bracers.","date":"2005-11-01T07:17:56-06:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":false,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false,"classicptr":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Goatlord","importedSubject":"<Blank>"},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":2705622,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"you can come to Incendius in aother way..

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Reports of elemental incursions in different parts of Kalimdor are increasing. Every few days, a new wave of elementals blasts its way into the regions of Silithus, Un'Goro Crater, Azshara, and Winterspring - ostensibly, for the sole reason of seeing just how far into these territories they can penetrate before being beaten back by the forces of the Horde or the Alliance. Investigate these regions and aid your allies in countering these mysterious invasions<br /><br />So i guess they spawn <b>Every few days</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can actually get to incendius as any class if you so want, it requires one invis potion. Rogues and druids are of course the obvious solution. Basically go left in the instance to the gatherings of dwarfs where there is an officer and 5 of his underlings. It is suggested you kill the one flame walker guy prior to the dwarves as its just easier. There are two single dogs (dogs see stealth and invis) to each side of the first dwarf pull and these dogs can be killed without pulling the dwarf group. Pull the dog on the right and kill it. Then hug the right wall. You cannot sneak past the first gathering of dwarves without stealth or invis, the officer will aggro. I suggest you try this once or twice without an invis pot to get a feel for when he aggros. Once you have a feel for when he will aggro on you slug the potion and start running for the gate. Once you clear the first Gathering of dwarves hang a right and head for the door and the pathway to Incendius. Stay in the middle and away from the wall there is a dog patrol along the right wall. As you run your invis potion is 18 seconds as your potion begins to run out stear towards the right wall and give yourself wide bearth to all the dwarf patrols. There is enough room if you are level 60 to navigate around all the dwarf patrols without invisibility or stealth. I have done this as a mage with two rogues. Here is the part I am unsure about. Once you clear the large door you enter a room with one last dwarf formation. Past the dwarf formation you walk down a narrowing hallway with those fireguards on either side. You can navigate around the Dwarf formation no problem. On all of my runs we kill ALL of the fireguards before incendius. If you wait long enough the dwarf formation leaves through the door and probably lets you walk down most of the narrowing hallway without invis (this part is theory craft) the last two guards will have to be killed or you will have to use another invis pot if you are trying to solo as a non stealthing class.<br /><br />There maybe someone can use all that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With fire resist gear, lord incendius is really easy.&nbsp; I'm a warlock and I can solo him and come out with over half health and mana.&nbsp; He's also really easy to solo your way to him, and you don't even need invis pots or anything.&nbsp; Go into BRD and go through the door to your left, then immediately to your right, and then again to your left to get into the East Garrison.&nbsp; Go up the first set of stairs, and head down the path to your left and jump out of the window.&nbsp; As a warlock i just sacrificed my voidwalker and ran past the mobs and out the window.&nbsp; as a mage you could just frost nova + blink, etc.&nbsp; once out the window, go to where the fire elementals are, and you only need to fight the last set of them, and you are at indendius.&nbsp; He dropped the ace for me once and he always drops nice FR bracers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>you can come to Incendius in aother way.. If u have stealth/prowl ;).. if u open shadowforge lock and then go behind the door taht opens u can jump from there and down behind the BIG door.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>77 Runs so far. No lies. Still hasn't dropped. Going to do it a few more times then call it quits. Whoever got it from Lord Incendius, your lucky.<br /><br />Edit: 77 times, not gonna quit now. This is some BS though.<br /><br />Edit: 95 Runs. I dont think Lord Incendius drops the Ace. I dont care what people said above. There must have been a patch.<br /><br />Edit: 100 Runs. No drop. Bought it from some guy for 250Gold with all the money I made off Large Brilliant Shards farming this s.o.b.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i am a 60 (combat sword spec) rogue<br />heres how i solo incedious:<br />stealth through BRD (watch out for the demon dogs they detect stealth)<br />Drink one Major Fire resist Pot<br />wait 2 min<br />Fight him opening with Adrenaline rush, when fire resist pot wears off use evasion. <br />Now, thing is fire resist pots do like 2500-3200 fire dmg absorbed, depending on how how much it abosorbs and how hard he hits that fight (he can crit pretty hard) I can take him down and only lose 1/2 health...but if he hits hard and fire protection goes shoddy on yeah just drink a Major health pot and youll live. <br /><br />done it 5 times now,<br />still no card<br />in flight to try it again :)<br />(btw it takes about 7min for instance to reset)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Someone has probably already said this, but im guessing the reason why the drop rate is so low on allakhazam is because the darkmoon cards werent available until a few patches ago, and most likely allakhazam displays data from all the patches together</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The reason why you couldn't find the ace is becasue it is assigned to the player winning the rolls, so no one but that player can loot it after they win it, you probly just managed to watch 180g despawn in front of you eyes because the winner of the roll forgot to check the corpse.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Lol the Saga countinues ...<br />Same evening after the Ace disappeared we talked to the GM, he said they can't do anything cuz there are no logs for outdoor drops ... so me and my friend decided to beat the system by getting a new Ace.<br /><br />We went to Winterspring to kill Princess Tempestia ... and guess what - ACE DROPPED :D this time i won it.<br />Im starting to think the allakhazam's data is either wrong or old.
