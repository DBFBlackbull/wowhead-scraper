They are used for flash bombs and the quest to get the schematic for flash bombs. <br /><br />Flash bombs are nice for guilds learning the panther boss in ZG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>598</b></h3>if you are going to go do the quest or farm for these to make flash bombs make sure you have some form of underwater breathing be it warlock buff, potion or simply from being undead because these suckers are deep underwater and going to the surfae between every clam would be a giant pain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7736</b></h3>Blue pearls are used for a quest in Badlands called Pearl Diving.You can get these in STV near the shore. You will find the clams to get these pearls near all the elite murlocs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>28465</b></h3>Use of a hydrocane from gnome helps with this alot. <br />Dont have to worry about spells running out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Its in the vile reef area.<br /><br />Hit beta.<br /><br />Hit object giant clam.<br /><br />Hit map.<br /><br />They are there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I can confirm they are lootable. I looted 2 clams, and got 2 pearls. And I don't even have the quest :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>There is another quest that gives you schematics to make a flash stick or something like that, its an AOE scare for beasts. <br /><br />I've also seen blue pearls listed as ingredients for some other high level things. I gotta think that Thott just hasn't had the data uploaded to it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has been fixed as of this patch.&nbsp; I got the pearls</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just tried and got a blue pearl on my first Giant Clam, so it would seem that this quest is fixed now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I havent got the quest, but I were swimming around in vile reef 10 minutes ago, and there I saw a giant clam, I opened it and found a blue pearl.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, it has been posted 9 (nine) times that it's fixed. To make a nice number I'll do it too.<br />Quest is fixed! Works for me! On the first try!<br /><br />Ok, and now stop<br /><br />Btw: you get the pearls even if you don't have the quest just because its no Quest Item and its used for engineering.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I think they now drop 100% because of the new flash bomb that requires them</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have been to the Vile Reef area 4 times. The 1st time I just happened to find a giant clam in shallow water, opened it and got a blue pearl. It was the first one that I had ever seen. The 2nd &amp; 3rd times I had the quest &amp; was helping another player with the quest. EVERY CLAM had a pearl! The 4th time through the reef was another passing by trip that I decided to hang around. I took a 1hr breathing potion and in 35 minutes had gathered 25 blue pearls at a 100% drop rate. Got some clam meat with some of them too. I just swim just below the surface and point my camera angle downward and scan around while I swim. When I see a giant clam, I dive straight to it. Also watching the chat box for STV is kind of amusing with all the whining about Horde camping... especially at Nesingway's. Good luck on finding the blue pearls when you are looking!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Opened first giant clam I saw - poof, a blue pearl. Didn't even have the quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does anyone have any experience with the price u can get for these blue pearls at the AH? They sell for only 50 copper to vendor. <br /><br />I have never seen any on the AH. That might be just by coincidence, or because they sell fast at high prices :-), or doesnt sell at all :-( .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Im only level 28 and i have dodged Murlocs to get to every clam i find<br /><br />my goal: iridescent pearls<br /><br />i have 11 blue pearls now with a 100% drop rate (hard to come by clams) and no iridescents<br /><br />so anyone who says they are difficult to find are just plain nuts =/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Please note the following takes place on dunemaul server, and may be differant on others.<br /><br />I attempted to sell a stack of 5 at some random price, no luck.&nbsp; I tryed selling 5 at 5s, noone wanted them.&nbsp; I tryed selling 1 at 1s, assuming that perhaps noone needed 5... noone needs 1 either.&nbsp; Bottom line? 100% vender trash on dunemaul server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have naver even tryed to get one but i was swimming at the wile reef and i opened one big clam and i got one :P and i opened one more and i got one more ... i didn't know some people had problems whit finding them so i never even tryed to get one more :S well youst ignore that you are blue pearl diving and you get one ;D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i have 81 days /played and i know most items but when i collected this i was like &quot;What the! whats this? a _Blue_ pearl?&quot; i guess ill save it for the Q and hand it in in the 1.10 patch since then xp=cash if your capped, prolly only get 20s from this low lvl q but what the hey ill do it anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Getting the Pearls as a Druid is a piece of cake. I'm dissapointed that it's not used more in crafting since I can farm about 20 of them in an hour. People do pay about 5-7 gold for 10 blue pearls once in awhile at the AH. That's good money for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just went out there looking for giant clam meat and well, I got 8 blu pearls in a row and no clam meat. :{<br /><br />Hehe, auctioneer says about 10g for the 8 I found. Might have a new hobby.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>These do not really sell on the AH, mainly because the only recipe they are used in (Correct me if I'm wrong) is the Flash Bomb, which is by no means desperately neccasary to anyones inventory...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Me being somewhat new to this game, lvl 39 Orc Warlock (with underwater breathing) had slightly close to a rough time but let me tell you, without my little blue cookie monster, it would have been very difficult. Blue Pearl in every clam i opened....total 19. Thought i hit something worth some $$$ but i guess i was wrong. 50 copper/pearl at the vendor. At the AH, no one seems to want them. Pretty view though. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RH.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I followed someones advice here..around 29.27 swam around..was confused. Decided to kill murlocs..ok..found a clam. Yes..blue pearl. But still felt like I was swimming around clueless.Then I saw One person said swim along the black line you see on your mini map..so I tried that... back and forth..and this was the most helpful hint I got. I Got 13 pearls in about 20 minutes. I had already swam around for about 45 until I tried some hints here. I got a blue pearl in every clam. I also found a chest in some ruins. Just becareful..in the middle of the &quot;black line&quot; you can get fatigued, so I pretty much swam up one side and down the other over and over. Cruising thru the reef looking for something to catch my cursor. I kept the extras to make more flash bombs. I didnt try to sell any.</div>
