Not sure what blizzard were thinking with this, however the cost simple isnt worth it. <br /><br />Im not sure i've ever heard of another use these, i know in our guild they have never been considered.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just as it says it drops off gyth, 15 man raid only Alch's rolled.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>No alchs in our group and I won the roll.&nbsp; Put it on AH for 60g buyout and someone bought it within an hour.&nbsp; Now I am left to wonder how much more I could have gotten for it. <br /><br />Oh well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>a lot</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>guys its worth around 250-400g depends on who u can sell it to. I just found one on the AH for 95g! Going to give it to my bro so it will help his guild with MC</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>hi. i am relatively new so please bear with me if my question is stupid. <br /><br />question: are all flasks (flask of the titans, flask of xxx) &quot;consumed&quot; after being used? <br /><br />Its because ive read in a forum that flasks are differentiated from poitions/elixirs in such that you can use them over and over again with only but a cooldown (much like a trinket).&nbsp; once you create it, its forever yours to use.<br /><br />Is this true? or if you use it, you need to make 1 again. thanks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With 1.7.0, they're making it so Flask effects persist through death. No worries about losing that very very expensive potion 4 minutes after you drink it because you lagged out in Badlands :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I picked the recipe up tonight, and now Im gonna start farming for the mats.<br /><br />I was wondering how much a single potion would go for.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i just bought the recipe last night for 200g.. i dont think its too much.. i will sell 60g each(potion).. so when i sell 4 of it i ll make profit.. and last thing-- i make also flask of supreme power(potion) and sell it in ah for 54g, the recipe was dropped..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I just saw this in the AH on Eldre'Thalas for a 16.5g buyout...but someone else bought it before I found out what it was worth.&nbsp; :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Does this stack with MOTW unlike magic resistance pot?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The only possibility is the magic resistance potion have shared cooldown with healing potions, but then again if you are doing an instance that require flask, you really don't want to depend on a healing potion to keep you alive.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm such a lucker ... bought it for 20g in the AH <br />:D :D :D<br />Well starting bid was 10g ... but 20g buyout ... perfect hihi.<br />Oh well ... Europe/Zuluhed.<br /><br />thx for it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I got this recipe drop in UBRS and grabbed it on a random greed roll. Didn't know what I had so I went to give it away in guild chat and noticed how EVERYONE wanted it soo badly. So I checked it out on kazam and median price was 275g. I then read how people sell the pots for 60g and couldn't help myself. 450 start, 750 buyout - Can you say 24 hours gone? Say hello to my epic mount. I also got Felstriker that same run, probably the best I'll have for a long time.<br /><br />60 hunter on Draenor - PEACE<br /><br />PS there weren't any rogues in the party so don't flame about the blade. It looks great with crusader on it btw.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok it's a flask, it stacks with ne buffs... it last 2hrs, ppl pay hella good money for just a +15 fire resis enchant for mc, this is 25 extra on top of all, BWL you need +all resistance pretty much.... guilds buy it to use for the guild mates as well in the raids, and makin' money, found it 2day and 'the other on a.h. is 800g bid only on my server so i under bid for 750g =) ! i can't believe i actually got this. i've been sooo broke till recently. Good luck all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have never seen this before in my entire wow career, and I have 5 lvl 60s.&nbsp; First alchemist, so I guess I'll have to run rend runs until this drops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>ok can someone please tell me, does this potion stack with other resistance buffs (eg druid buff) or does it not? I've been looking all over the internet with people saying yes, no, yes, no etc.&nbsp; Surely blizzard wouldnt create a flask that takes the better half of 4 hours to make (if you include farming and running scholo to get to the alchemy tables) for a buff that can be replaced by 300 or so mana from a druid...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i won this recipe on a roll last night, was very happy. BUT, after rend finally died, the group started crying saying that it is end loot. so i had to give it up to the leader of the raid.&nbsp; I was so angry after that, i dropped that group. The bad part was it was my guild full raid.&nbsp; Anyway, this flask is very helpful for MC runs. (last time i do a run with my guild, may change guild)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>dude those guys r guildies its your loot u won it u get it they said roll for it cause if they did then its your no way someone else could get it so its your loot nobody elses and u had to do something bout there but if there was an alchemist in the group who could make the flask for the guild then he should take it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>uhhhhh what?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>this item stacks with other buffs as it says lolol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i won it today in UBRS. im an alchemist but dont know if i should learn it or just sell it? which would be better and how much do you think it would sell for?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>The Flasks are:<br /><b>Flask of Chromatic Resistance</b> - adds 25 to all resistances (fire, frost, nature, shadow, arcane) for 2 hours.&nbsp; Recipe drops ONLY from Gyth (Rend Blackhand's mount) in the stadium in UBRS.<br /><br /><b>Flask of the Titans</b> - increases health by 1200 for 2 hours.&nbsp; Recipe drops from General Drakkisath, end boss of UBRS.<br /><br /><b>Flask of Distilled Wisdom</b> - adds 2000 to mana for 2 hours.&nbsp; Recipe drops from Balnazzar, the end boss in Live Stratholme.<br /><br /><b>Flask of Supreme Power</b> - increases damage from magical spells and effects by up to 150 for 2 hours.&nbsp; Recipe drops from Ras Frostwhisper, in Scholomance.<br /><br /><b>Flask of Petrification</b> - turn to stone for one minute.&nbsp; This is a fairly common drop worldwide from mobs 45-60+.&nbsp; Petrification is the odd one out among the flasks - it is easier to get, and less popular by far.<br /><br />All flasks <b>require level 50</b> or greater to use, and have an average Auction House price in the area of <b>50g per flask</b> (varies greatly).&nbsp; The price isn't that much less within a guild, simply because of the cost of components. Price of a recipe (except petrification) is about 200 - 400g (varies greatly).<br /><br />Chance of any of the above bosses dropping their recipe is about one in 40.&nbsp; (who's killed Drakk 40 times?)<br /><br />These flasks are reserved for the elite gamers in the elite dungeons - who can afford to spend 50g on a potion (or 500g for a party of 10) to run a dungeon that doesn't average more than 50g in loot <i>per player</i> per run?&nbsp; <br /><br />The fact that flasks don't stack with other flasks is only a minor annoyance - every character will have to choose the stat they need - casters will go with mana or more spell damage, melee characters will choose between resistances and basic AC. And at the elite levels we're talking about, players will have a host of other items, armour and equipment that offer similar bonuses.<br /><br />Keep an eye out on this site and others for an indication of the average value dropped by each mob in an instance - you decide whether or not it is worth 50g a run (can you do it in 2 hours? :o)<br /><br />For a reference sheet of all alchemy recipes, try <a href="http://www.!@#$%^&amp;*!@.com/wow/professions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.*!@#$%^&amp;*!.com/wow/professions.html</a><br /><br />(Thanks to Thott for a great site!)</div>
