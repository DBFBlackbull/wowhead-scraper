<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finaly guys.. the tomb is located on the top of the water fall just before the water comes, and it guarded by 3 lvl 34-35.. Good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>sorry for my very bad english, but i found out a good way to get this... you have to get there from the coast. North of the coast you'll find a gate. kill 2 37mobs, pass the gate, and follow the path until you are in front of a wall. there are again 2-3 mobs to kill. then just try to get on that wall. it's possible, i did it. when you're on the wall, kill again 2-3mobs, and go directly to the waterfall.<br />That's it. i did this 4th part alone (warlock 36), hope you'll be as lucky as me :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>If you guys would stop arguing for a moment about the Coords you would notice that u are both right..in this area there are 2 tombs and at each of the coord is a tomb.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>This quest isn't elite, and it wouldn't be that hard save that the 4th troll legend is in a city full of trolls with a very short respawn (2-3 mins). It's possible to solo your way in at a relatively low level, but you can get trapped very easily. There is also one tablet near a bunch of elite murlocs. Bottom line- don't try it alone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>its at 23,12, not 23,8</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>at the ruins entrance turn right. run on top of the hill along the wall (outside) until you reach loc 26,8. there you jump ON the wall. at the right corner you will see a small ledge that goes along the wall towards the waterfall. jump on that ledge carefully and run on it until you reach the pool above the waterfall (you might have to run &quot;into&quot; the wall to keep on the ledge). now you are directly behind the 4th legend. kill the guys and exit the way you came in. easy =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I dont really get it.. Why dont you put normal cordinates like 23,52 you know, xx,yy not xx,y. Does that 24,8 mean 24,80 ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I never post but I jsut have to brag. Go from the north east side, and jump onto the ledge from the mountains there, and ull see a ledge at the northern most part that continues to the waterfall. its small enough to walk on if u push into the wall the whole way. I killed 2 mobs at the tablet, it took 2 minutes total. Battleant/37 paladin/Anetheron</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>1. if you go to the east side enterns of the compound ware the 3 guards standing, whit the middle one of them got a tiger <br />(btw you don't have to kill them unless you like to kill them ofcorse ;-)<br />2. you go to the right up the hill (26,08) <br />3. there you see the wall in front of you just jump on it <br />4. walk (north) to high wall <br />5. get on the small leags walk (east) on it <br />6. walk till you come to the waterfall and you can go of it<br />7. then walk on top of the waterfall going south you see the tablet strait in front of you, <br />8. kill the guards and get the goods <br />9. go back the same way you came <br /><br />done in +/- 3 min. lvl 35 mage :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Okay, there's a lot of good descriptions on HOW to get to the tablet, but there's no general &quot;here's where the tablet is&quot; comment (that I saw at least). <br /><br />K, on the minimap, at the top of the ruins is a rectangular body of water split in half by a wall. The tablet is on the southern edge of this pool almost in the middle on the higher level (which is the western half of the ruins). This should help people out quicker than having to read vague descriptions of &quot;jump on the wall&quot; (which you should do, once you find out where the tablet is)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>DO NOT climb the walls from the west. East is much better as you will not aggro the 41 elite. East seems a bit harder to get on the wall, but if you start in the NE corner of the entire place, there's a long (albeit skinny) wall that you can walk along to the tablet, avoiding the elite. Incidentally, you can blink into the wall if you're a mage while on the skinny ledge if you're up for something interesting. <br /><br />I actually came from the west walls, aggroed the elite and his henchmen. Fortunately, there was an opposing faction player nearby, and he picked up all the aggro and died for some reason :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just solo'ed as a 35 warrior, and only had to fight two level 37s. <br /><br />Approach from the NE side of the compound, to the right of the entrance. You then need to get up on the outside wall. I did this by going into the NE corner where the wall meets the mountain, and jumping up the crevice. Pretty easy.<br /><br />Next, walk along the very thin ledge above the water, and get on top of the waterfall. You should see the tablet to the south. Most of the mob is on the other side of the tablet. I simply got in range and pulled two 37s above the waterfall and killed them there. Then I strolled right up, activated the tablet, and left the same way I came in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Tnx guys sweet info on this, didn't have to fight a single 1. Walk along the water fall on the wall go across and get behind the slab, inch your way up till you can get it they didn't even bother me.<br />lol tnx<br /><br />To add to this you can also on the way back along the wall u will see a chest with only 1 inside the area, 1 will walk in with his tiger wait for them to leave then jump down walk over take all the goodies in the chest and hearthstone home!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>ok this one was tricky, after finding the thierd place it's a little easier. I died several times in order to get close to it.<br />Best idea for location, <br />on area map at top of screen, the ruins will show , it is located in the middle of the ruins towrds the top,its on the second lvl of ground. right beside the large pool that creates a waterfall. From the thierd location it's steight accross and up the ramp. TONS of trolls around.<br /><br />I aggroed tons of trolls as i ran looking for it, when i died i took a look around the top plateau, and found it, rezed again and ran to that spot, died again very close to it. when i rezed the last time i was in the pool of water, it didn't agro the enemys around so i had time to heal and summon void walker.<br />i sent the void walker in and agroed the two trolls standing beside the stone and clicked on the stone . THen i ran liked crazy to get out before they killed him off. <br />I hope that helped, (i suk at spelling, sry)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Using cosmos 24,8 up on the top most plateu where the water channel is at its highest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Tricky little thing, took me forever to find it. Located on the Ziggurat.</div>
