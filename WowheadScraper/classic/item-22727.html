Tier 3 warlock gear (which many will have by the time this staff is crafted) has +7% spell crit and a set bonus of 25% reduced aggro on crits.&nbsp; Clearly, warlocks value +crit and many raiding warlocks have Ruin which gives 100% crit damage bonus.&nbsp; No sane warlock is going to turn down +crit. \n\nSaying that warlocks' main damage is through dots and that +crit is useless shows you do not understand warlocks in end-game content.&nbsp; Off the top of my head, the break down of warlock DPS is roughly 60% shadow bolt, 25% corruption, 15% immolate\/agony.&nbsp; The majority of warlock DPS comes from direct damage spells (shadow bolt and part of immolate) so +crit is a big increase to DPS.&nbsp; With around 10 standard debuff slots, that only leaves 6 slots for say 20 DPS classes to work with.&nbsp; If warlocks tried to do damage only through DoTs, they would regularly be pushed off and have very low DPS indeed.&nbsp; It depends on the particular fight, but warlocks and mages actually have very comparable DPS.&nbsp; In particular, I have 15% spell crit and out DPS at least half the mages and hunters and even some rogues. \n\nThat said, I agree that the +2% crit aura on the mage version is pretty powerful since as average +spell power increases, +crit provides more of a bonus.&nbsp; However, +33 spell damage is pretty powerful as well and I don't think anyone can intelligently say that the staff is better in general for one class.&nbsp; I would say it really depends on the guild (whether they need more DPS or healing) and then on simply who deserves it more (i.e. who has more points).\"\n\n30\/21\/0&nbsp;

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Finaly a good weapon for resto druids!<br /><br />At last we can heal and do some DPS.<br />I just hate when mages and rogues can grind mobs +3 times faster than me, and respeccin to feral/balance isin't an option because i woulden't be much of use inside instances.<br /><br />And the tier3 set is only +healing (again, what a surprise). So you pwan inside instances but outside you can't do sh**.<br /><br />The only way resto druid's can grind some gold is to make an alt rogue or a mage. But no more, thx bliz ^_^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>My only complaint about the Druid one is i think it would have been nice to throw in a little bit of armor if nothing else than for giggles, maybe like 100 like good ole ironwood. <br /><br />Also seems to me as stated previous The Druid aura is most powerful as it helps all Casters including hunters where as the others really don't.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>well seeing that it says it will teleport u too Karahzahn (not sure if i spelled it right) will u only be able to form it when the Burning Crusade comes out?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>clear winner&nbsp; ROFL&nbsp; first of all&nbsp; this staff is equally good to all players&nbsp; yes theres no balance druids in raid because they r useless&nbsp; but think about it&nbsp; &nbsp; if a druid were to get this&nbsp; obviously he wont be needing anythign else since he prolly has the best fo the best in the whole game.... so why woudlnt he respecc to PvP for some DPS&nbsp; in that case&nbsp; this staff would be godly.&nbsp; raids arent &quot;everything&quot; and surely when u get the best fo the best&nbsp; ua itn gonna be doing that many more raids&nbsp; so wats left...<br /><br />oh and another thing...&nbsp; the post above me&nbsp; witht he whole&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Clearly druids r the winners because the aura benefits the whole raid&quot;&nbsp; u sir r a moron&nbsp; read the weapon as stated long time ago&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;BENEFITS PARTY&quot;&nbsp; god&nbsp; im sure they would have maid raid totems before they made this a raid aura</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&quot;Not to be rude, but your analysis of warlocks is wrong.&nbsp; Tier 3 warlock gear (which many will have by the time this staff is crafted) has +7% spell crit and a set bonus of 25% reduced aggro on crits.&nbsp; Clearly, warlocks value +crit and many raiding warlocks have Ruin which gives 100% crit damage bonus.&nbsp; No sane warlock is going to turn down +crit. <br /><br />Saying that warlocks' main damage is through dots and that +crit is useless shows you do not understand warlocks in end-game content.&nbsp; Off the top of my head, the break down of warlock DPS is roughly 60% shadow bolt, 25% corruption, 15% immolate/agony.&nbsp; The majority of warlock DPS comes from direct damage spells (shadow bolt and part of immolate) so +crit is a big increase to DPS.&nbsp; With around 10 standard debuff slots, that only leaves 6 slots for say 20 DPS classes to work with.&nbsp; If warlocks tried to do damage only through DoTs, they would regularly be pushed off and have very low DPS indeed.&nbsp; It depends on the particular fight, but warlocks and mages actually have very comparable DPS.&nbsp; In particular, I have 15% spell crit and out DPS at least half the mages and hunters and even some rogues. <br /><br />That said, I agree that the +2% crit aura on the mage version is pretty powerful since as average +spell power increases, +crit provides more of a bonus.&nbsp; However, +33 spell damage is pretty powerful as well and I don't think anyone can intelligently say that the staff is better in general for one class.&nbsp; I would say it really depends on the guild (whether they need more DPS or healing) and then on simply who deserves it more (i.e. who has more points).&quot;<br /><br />30/21/0&nbsp; <br /><br />max dot damage build and i guarentee you that it will out dps any sm/ruin build in terms of equal character skill and gear<br /><br />2nd<br /><br />&quot;Off the top of my head, the break down of warlock DPS is roughly 60% shadow bolt, 25% corruption, 15% immolate/agony.&nbsp; The majority of warlock DPS comes from direct damage spells (shadow bolt and part of immolate)&quot;<br /><br />and thats just the thing... naxx is a frost/shadow instance and in terms of spell damage fire is the most pontent inside of naxx because of the resistances and such of the mobs/bosses (think of a fire mage dmg vs a frost mage dmg in mc)<br /><br />and it's a fact that in terms of fire dmg a warlock will not beat a mage because a warlock only has really 2 choices to used in instances <br /><br />imo/conflag combos and soulfire (soulfire really sucks tho because of the min cd and the soulshard reagant)<br /><br />if a lock were to use searing pain there would be a strong chance of pulling aggro off of the mt even w/ the 25% threat reduction <br /><br />and i don't know if u just have @#$%ty mages on ur server or what because only 1 of two things should put a warlock ahead of an equally geared mage in a long instance and thats either<br /><br />A. the warlock isn't managing aggro and going balls out the entire time, groups have wiped and bots ahve had to be dropped.<br /><br />B. the warlock is 30/21/0 and after sacin the sucubus had a rezzer right on the rez so the lock not only recieved a 10% dmg boost from shadow mastery but also from master demo and a 15% boost from the suc sac totalling 35% bonus shadow dmg would in naxx would probably mitigate to somewhere around a 15% increase w/ as much dmg being resisted due to shadow being non-binary<br /><br />and of course every server does things a little differently and how i've explained it to u is just how things go on the 2 servers i play on</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>kidding, of course.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Looking at this staff each one of the bonus's for the bearer is damn nice.... yah balance druids get no balance out of this but wtf do druids do in raids.... they heal.... don't raids expecting something that is gonna help yah in non raiding.<br /><br />MAGE: 2% crit aura very nice and helps all the casters in the party be healer or dps caster. Also 1% crit many consider equal to about 16 spell damage.<br /><br />WARLOCK: 33 Spell damage aura to party. Only benefits the damage casters in the party, party would need to be dps caster heavy for aura effectiveness. <br /><br />PRIEST: 62 Healing aura for party, party would need to be healer heavy to benefit from this aura. Also having played a healer and most healers in raid guilds I know agree +healing is nice but theres a limit to how much it really helps at high ends when multiple healing healing the same tanks. <br /><br />DRUID: 11 Mana every 5 seconds aura to party. Party would need to be caster heavy but really 11 mana every 5 seconds is a TOTAL joke. Thats the equivlent of maybe 40 more spirit and really wouldn't make much of a difference in raids at all. A druid getting this staff I'd have to laugh at any guild that bloody stupid.<br /><br />How I see it its a toss up between Mage / Warlock for how it would benefit the guild / raids the most maybe slightly leaning towards mage but only very slightly. Priests would be somewhat behind but still useful but not anywhere as much for the aura. Just tack on that aura to more overhealing done when your raids decked in T2-T3. Druids, no bloody way.... completely wasted on a druid for the aura. <br /><br />And yes the aura is party only and doesn't effect the entire raid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, I've read al lthis, and you people are %^&amp;*!ing about what Class should get it.&nbsp; Here's my opinion, It's not a CLASS who should get it, I think it should go to the person who Uses their Mana the most effectivly.&nbsp; If a Mage knows how to manage their mana, and is able to do a LOT of damage, give it to the mage, if a priest stands above as the best healer anyone has seen, give it to him.&nbsp; Or, maby, just give it to the Squishy who's gonna get all the Awesome gear first(Or already has a lot of awesome gear)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok this is obviously the best weapon that i know of for a priest and a druid. Those are the only classes that should even be considered for it. Who gets the weapon between the two is decided in the guild/raid (whatever the raid feels is best). Thinking that this could be better in the hands of mages or warlocks, well is just not smart. Both of the auras provided from a priest and a druid are quite beneficial. And if ur guild/raid really needs it get it twice to cover all of the healing/caster parties.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>According to members of Vis Maior, whose member Sera created the first Frame of Atiesh, the quest it gives you tells you to &quot;Find someone that can assist you in locating the remaining pieces and exorcising the evil from the staff.&quot;<br /><br />They just announced that this &quot;person&quot; was found to be Anachronos.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>One word in response to the two quotes and answers:<br /><br />Owned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>NO one b/c its not out yet!&nbsp; but if i had to say some one id say priest or druid the +300 healin is beast!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Failure from the guild Risen has it (priest)<br /><br />Also it's a quest obtained when you have the frame witch drops from Kel'Thuzad!<br /><br />And the Frame will probably NOT go for Dkp since you will also need to have 40 splinters (witch most guilds give to 1 specific person when the first 1 drops!)<br /><br />You then need to get the base of Atiesh from C'Thun and then go to Stratholme and defeat the demon Atiesh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>&nbsp; At all of you who are claiming that everyone should roll on the pieces:<br /><br />1) 99% are not in, or ever will be, in an endgame <br />guild.<br /><br />2)to Druidmister who says that everyone should be able to roll on the shards &quot;so that nobody feels under appreciated and so that anybody who wants it at least has a chance. &quot;&nbsp; The shards are not, nor ever will be, rolled on or by DKP, the shards are ALWAYS going to be on merit.<br /><br />3) When I say they will be done by merit that means that its going to be going to:<br />A- Someone who has very high raid attendance because anyone who knows anything about endgame knows that it is RETARDED to give a weapon of this caliber to someone who is inactive or just a casual gamer, it will be going to someone who has near perfect raid attendance. <br /><br />B- Also the shards are not going to be given to just anyone, they will most likely, be given to officers or people who are long-time and loyal members.<br />C- Finally about what class gets it, the staff will be given to the class that the that the guild needs the aura from the most. This could be any of the 4 classes according to the guild's needs, and the needs of each guild is different. If the guild sees that they are in need of more healing they will most likely merit the staff to a priest as the priest aura boosts healing done.&nbsp; If a guild sees that the area they need to improve the most is their damage output, then the staff will be merited to a mage or warlock.&nbsp; Finally if the guild sees that they have a problem with healers running out of mana then they will consider giving it to a druid. It is as simple as that, the staff WILL GO to the class that benefits the guild, as a whole, to have with the staff. <br /><br />4) Also the staff/shards will never go to people who:<br />A- never stop pissing and moaning about everything because they are people who are unhappy with the guild and are more likely to leave the guild.<br />B- plan to e-bay their account.<br />C- Someone who plans to quit WoW.<br /><br />5) Sorry to all the druids, but the staff when it comes to you is as follows:<br />A- Restorations druids are going to have the staff before druids of other builds receive it.<br /><br /> You can think of this staff as the Benediction of Druids, while it can serve as a weapon for PvP, it is BEST for a druid who, for the most part, heals. Druids if you do not believe me lets look at the stats that the staff provides for you.<br /><br /><b>DRUID VERSION<br />Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian <br />Two Hand&nbsp; Staff <br />130 - 244 Damage&nbsp; Speed 2.90 <br />(64.4 damage per second) <br />+28 Stamina <br />+28 Intellect <br />+27 Spirit <br />Durability 145 / 145 <br />Requires Level 60 <br />Equip: Restores 11 mana per 5 sec. <br />Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 300. <br />Equip: +420 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear forms only. <br />Equip: Restores 11 mana every 5 sec to party members within 30 yards. <br />Use: Creates a portal. Teleporting group members that use it to Karazhan.</b><br /><br />First off lets look at the simple stats that it gives:<br />A)<br />+28 Stamina <br />+28 Intellect <br />+27 Spirit <br /><br />These stats, like it or not, are mainly for restoration druids.&nbsp; While they can help balance druids as well, the stats are geared more towards to a restoration druid. (As for feral try Str and Agi, they kinda help you the most)<br /><br />B)<br />Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 300. <br /><br />... can it be more clear that this is for restoration druids?<br /><br />C)<br />Equip: Restores 11 mana per 5 sec.<br /><br />Druids,<br />Restoration: Great!<br />Balance: Could get some use from it.<br />Feral: What is mana?<br /><br />D)<br />Equip: +420 Attack Power in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear forms only.<br /><br />Yes I do admit this ONE bonus is beneficial for feral druids,and feral druids only, (if you look it says nothing about moonkin), lets look at the stats again quickly...<br /><br />Stat 1:<br />+28 Stamina <br />+28 Intellect <br />+27 Spirit <br /><br />Breaking it down:<br /><br />Restoration: Great Stats!<br />Balance: ok<br />Feral: &quot;stam is ok... wtf is intellect for?&quot;<br /><br />Stat 2:<br /><br />Equip: Restores 11 mana per 5 sec. <br /><br />Breaking it down:<br /><br />Restoration: Greatly heals!<br />Balance: somewhat helps<br />Feral: &quot;what is this mana that you speak of?&quot;<br /><br />Stat 3:<br /><br />Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 300. <br /><br />Breaking it down:<br /><br />Restoration: Perfect<br />Balance: Moonkin cant heal<br />Feral: Worthless<br /><br />When it comes to Balance and Feral Druids, there are better items for you, just because you see a orange dont think that it is your ultimate weapon.<br /><br />For feral druids there are items such as the Herald Of Woe:<br /><br />Herald of Woe<br />Binds when picked up<br />Two-Hand Mace<br />199 - 300 Damage Speed 3.40<br />(73.4 damage per second)<br />+31 Strength<br />+22 Stamina<br />+20 Intellect<br />+17 Spirit<br />Durability 120 / 120<br />Requires Level 60<br />Sells for 16 Gold 60 Silver 93 Copper to vendors<br />Item Level 75<br /><br />it is by FAR a better weapon for you, not to mention that if you are doing naxx, you have BWL on super farm status, The herald drops of Flamegor with almost a 12% drops rate, so anyone who wants one will have more than ample opportunity to get one.<br /><br />As far as Balance druids go, for those of you who already know this please bear with me, but for those who dont know one of the main things that a balance druid needs is +spell dmg. This staff gives you ZERO spell dmg. There are many other weapons that are far better for you, more options to list here are just but a FEW!:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Lok'amir%20il%20Romathis">Lok'amir il Romathis</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Blessed%20Qiraji%20Acolyte%20Staff">Blessed Qiraji Acolyte Staff</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Brimstone%20Staff">Brimstone Staff</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Fist%20of%20Cenarius">Fist of Cenarius</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Shadow%20Wing%20Focus%20Staff">Shadow Wing Focus Staff</a><br />even the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Staff%20of%20Dominance">Staff of Dominance</a><br /><br />Heck you can even get a 1H item and get an off-hand!<br /><br />just look at some of the 1H items you can use<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Wraith%20Blade">Wraith Blade</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Stinger%20of%20Ayamiss">Stinger of Ayamiss</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Runesword%20of%20the%20Red">Runesword of the Red</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Midnight%20Haze">Midnight Haze</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Mace%20of%20Unending%20Life">Mace of Unending Life</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Fang%20of%20the%20Mystics">Fang of the Mystics</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Claw%20of%20Chromaggus">Claw of Chromaggus</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/search?q=Bloodcaller">Bloodcaller</a><br /><br />and the list goes on...<br /><br /><i>Really if you actually STILL think that The shards and staff should go to just anyone, then you are beyond help and you should just spend your time in Ironforge or Ogrimmar and if your lucky you can inspect the people who actually can HANDLE end-game.</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>orly? the staff teleports you to the front of the instance, you actually have to walk through the gate yourself, which isn't open at this time ^^ wait for the expansion ;)<br /><br />kharazan isn't in the game data, otherwise i could look at this instance with the mapviewer :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Have you checked out the stats on that weapon?<br /><br />Mages get spell power and % to crit for the whole party. Warlocks get spell power, % to crit, AND their party members get a spell power boost. Even priests get + to damage and healing spell. But druids get healing and attack power *yuck*.<br /><br />I don't think they could have made it more useless for me if they tried. Oh wait.... 11 mana per 5 seconds (faints). Oh well, if I bother to grind this thing out I'll have a back-up weapon for healing if I can't get someone else to heal.....</div>
