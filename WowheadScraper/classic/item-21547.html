<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Please note that the posts made below me are posted on April 1st. <br /><br />I can confirm the farming takes about 2-3 hours if you're not so lucky. The recipe is NOT a 1-2% drop, but (far) below that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>who drops it ? :S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I've sold a number of these on Frostwolf. They are around a 2-3% drop rate for me, according to MobInfo.<br /><br /> As usual YMMV, as you can run in and kill a few and get one straight away, but if you're farming for more than 1, you should expect to wait a while for the next one.<br /><br /> I've sold a few for 100g each when I first put them on the AH. People are currently paying about 40-50g for them, but the Asian farmers have finally picked up on these so now the prices for materials have gone through the roof.<br /><br /> I would expect the price of these recipes to settle down to 20-40g depending how much people keep farming for them. For my part, they rank about the same drop rate as the greater nature protection potion from WPL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>A friend and I were doing a quest chain to get a BRD quest and got two of these in a row while just trying to get the daggers from the dwarves.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>At level 55 I ran around Searing Gorge just killing guys for quests and this dropped. I thought &quot;eh, it's probably some junk recipe.&quot;<br /><br />When I got back to the AH and went to post it, I was surprised at what Auctioneer said I should sell it for. 400g. I brought it down a little lower, because I thought it was some joke posting and figured &quot;hey, if someone wants to buy it for 375, be my guest.&quot;<br /><br />A couple hours later I log onto my bank char to check his mail. The auction sold.<br /><br />That recipe made me 369g (after ah taxes) and it was just some random drop in SG.<br /><br />Thanks to that, I bought my epic mount at 56 and now i'm saving up for Lionheart Helm / Titanic Leggins / Other BoE Epics for PvP.</div>

I'm currently at 2.5 hours (constant farming Dark Iron Dwarf Slavers and Taskmasters with my level 60 mage), in the slag pit and this pattern hasn't dropped yet. <br /><br />Edited, Wed Mar 29 20:52:39 2006</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This thing will not drop, been farming for over 2 hours in the slag pit and barracks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I got one on my 11th kill, then killed another 60-80 mobs and nothing.<br /><br />Weird drop rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I saw this in ah and had to find out where it dropped. Wasn't about to pay 90g so I went to SG to try my luck. Got it on the first mob no lie. It was amazing =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>The info given says its a 0.05% drop chance (306 in 608,627 kills) but the recipe was just introduce in 1.10 and a lot of the kills recorded here were probably pre patch so this isn't accurate by a long shot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>238 kills and I got 1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I saw this guy trying to sell this recipe for 30g in general. I though, &quot;Oh. That wasnt to much for that great recipe&quot; and I whispered him and asked if i could get it for 22g. He said ok and sent it in CoD for 22s instead of 22g.<br />Now he is spamming I'm a ninja in general. Haha.<br />His mistake, his loss.<br />Would you guys call me a ninja just because I did not send the recipe/money back to him?<br />Im pretty known and got good reputation so no one belive that ninja crap anyway.<br /><br />By the way, I sold Abyssal Plate Legs for 60s instead of 60g 2 days before that happend.. heh, I did not even whisper that guy and ask if he could send it back. I just whispered and said he was a lucky bastard ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Already up on the AH here for 70g/85g BO. I'm going to say that's a little high, and just wait for a cheaper one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>grabbed one in about half an hour of farming</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Really a luck factor in this. Got one now after... 10 kills orso. Still trying my luck now for more :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>As Grimhyde said, this recipe is a recent introduction. The right way to find its drop rate is based on incremental drops over incremental kills, not drops over total kills. I've been watching this for a couple of weeks (since I got two in one trip and sold them for much more than I thought they were worth), and the actual drop rate is around 0.75%. There isn't data to suggest that one mob has a higher drop rate than another; the initial trend was that Taskmaster was slightly higher, but it has been coming down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>lol<br />killed 100 of these guys and 5 recipes :P 2 enchants for demonslaying :)) Selling these now allot on Twilight's Hammer</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I dont care how good rep you got or how know you are OR what you lost some days before....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kaynen</b></h3>All the bragging and no one says where and who drops this. So many years of trolls who should all be down voted for wasting every ones time.<br /><br />Dark Iron watchmen: <br />Dark Iron slaver:<br />Dark Iron Taskmaster: All are in Searing gorge. Level 50 required for recipe to drop (If Lv requirement has changed then say so instead of thumbs down like a newb.)<br /><br />Reference: <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?item=21547" rel="nofollow">https://classicdb.ch/?item=21547</a><br /><br />I friggen hate braggers.<br /><br />From Classic Kaynen thats playing Krithia on Myzrael. (Give shout out and clap if drop eyes on her.)<br /><br />Enjoy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dimiteddy1</b></h3>To save you the trouble. Its not available yet in classic. Dont farm taskmasters. Phase 5</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bugfinder</b></h3>Classic AQ PTR<br />Drop rate is around 3-5%. Very easy and fast to grind as a mage or other AOE class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>musclefollower</b></h3>It was added already for Phase 5, I just saw one in the AH. 2020-07-28</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>caffo666</b></h3>For many months no one gave a #$%^ about these dwarfs. Today after phase 5 release there is absolutely zero spawns and 20+ people trying to farm this. good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tokutenrai</b></h3>Got 3 of these with a guildy over a 2 hour period.<br />1 dropped from the Dark Iron Slaver. two from the Dark Iron Taskmasters.<br /><br />The item isn't terribly rare, i'd say 3-4% drop rate in reality.. we did have most of the cave to ourselves.<br /><br />For reference on number of kills, I had just under 6 stacks of Mageweave when the first dropped and my Guildy had about 4. The 3rd dropped when i had about 10 stacks, and he 6. <br /><br />My realm has 9 on AH right now... we used two of them as we are alchemists.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KnightTime</b></h3>Drops from one more Dark Iron mob, beyond Taskmasters and Slavers.........<br /><br />Watchmen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>malcherus</b></h3>With little competition for spawns, it took me <b>2 hours 43 minutes</b> for a total of <b>236 kills</b> to finally get the recipe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lyariana</b></h3>I farmed this today, the night after P5 patch dropped. I spent about an hour in the cave with the slavers &amp; taskmasters before it dropped. I didn't tag every mob; I got maybe 2-3 through the whole cave &amp; outside. I also waited until late at night to farm it, when less people would be around. <br /><br />I ran loops through the cave; entering through the bottom entrance, going round through the gate, then up to the ramp, through the left entry, along the corridor, into the big room and back out the entrance at the top. Remember to go outside as there are a few of these that patrol the crater as well.<br /><br />From guildies who also have farmed this today, it seems that the drop rate quoted here is fairly accurate (3-5%) and it should drop within an hour or two if you have the place mostly to yourself. <br /><br />And to quote it in mageweave, i looted 51 pieces of mageweave (2.5 stacks) before the recipe dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dnadn</b></h3>110 killed on SOD phase 2 , seems drop not activated yet</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KurousWG</b></h3>I've done at least 250-300 over the past 3 days. Nothing so far. Hope they add to SOD</div>
